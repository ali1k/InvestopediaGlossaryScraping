To an actuary, these types of events and losses are said to have been incurred but not reported.\n", "\nIBNR is frequently used by <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/111314/top-10-insurance-companies-metrics.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">insurance companies</a>, particularly along the East and Gulf Coasts of the United States (where hurricanes and other natural disasters are common). After a storm hits, actuaries estimate the potential damage to infrastructure and the claims that may be anticipated. Based on this analysis, money is then set aside (in a reserve) to pay for claims. Again, in this example, the actual losses have been incurred, but have not officially been reported.\n", "\nThere are numerous scenarios that can conspire and make it necessary for insurance companies to maintain funding provisions for IBNR claims.\n", "\nFor example, the potential impact of slowly developing occupational disease claims on workers' compensation claims. Such examples\u00a0include silicosis, asbestosis, and certain cancers determined to be related to occupational exposures. Defective product\u00a0or product liability claims often have delayed reporting, such as\u00a0lead-based paint, asbestos insulation, and\u00a0defective drywall.\n", "\nPoor environmental practices can also result in delayed reporting of environmental liability claims. Finally, short-term workers compensation injuries and healthcare claims to a group healthcare plan can experience delayed reporting.\n", "\nDelayed reporting impacts several types of\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/06/insurancecontracts.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">insurance coverages</a>, which\u00a0require\u00a0an IBNR calculation. These\u00a0include\u00a0workers' compensation, environmental/pollution, healthcare, general liability, and\u00a0products liability.\n", "\nDetermining the right and proper formula for\u00a0calculating an\u00a0appropriate IBNR\u00a0has always been one of the toughest challenges of the\u00a0insurance industry. Insurance claim variables are non-normally distributed, which makes\u00a0estimating them\u00a0problematic\u2013and not getting it right is not without consequence.\u00a0Inaccurate estimates can\u00a0project an incorrect view of an\u00a0insurer\u2019s health and may result in\u00a0action being taken\u00a0that could\u00a0be detrimental to the company.\n", "\nAt a minimum,\u00a0an actuary would likely use this client data\u00a0to calculate IBNR:\n"]}
