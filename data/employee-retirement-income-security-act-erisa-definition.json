ERISA also covers some non-retirement accounts, such as employee health plans.\n", "\nUnder ERISA, plans must provide participants with information about plan features and funding, regularly and free of charge. The <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebsa.asp\">Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA)</a>, a unit of\u00a0the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dol.asp\">Department of Labor (DOL)</a>, oversees and enforces ERISA provisions.\n", "\nMost employer-sponsored retirement plans, both <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/definedbenefitpensionplan.asp\">defined-benefit</a> and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/definedcontributionplan.asp\">defined-contribution</a>, are covered by ERISA. Common examples include <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/401kplan.asp\">401(k) plans</a>, pensions, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deferred-compensation.asp\">deferred-compensation</a> plans, and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"5\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profitsharingplan.asp\">profit-sharing plans</a>. Examples of non-retirement employer plans that fall under ERISA include <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"6\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hmo.asp\">health maintenance organization (HMO)</a> plans, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"7\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/flexiblespendingaccount.asp\">flexible spending accounts (FSAs)</a>, disability insurance, and life insurance.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\"></span>\n", "\nERISA requires accountability of plan fiduciaries. It generally defines a fiduciary as anyone who exercises discretionary authority or control over a plan\u2019s management or assets, including anyone who provides investment advice to the plan. Fiduciaries who do not follow the principles of conduct may be held responsible for restoring losses to the plan. In addition,\u00a0ERISA addresses fiduciary provisions and bans the misuse of assets through these provisions.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\"></span>\n", "\nERISA also sets minimum standards for participation, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vesting.asp\">vesting</a>, benefit accrual, and funding. The law defines how long a person may be required to work before becoming eligible to participate in a plan, accumulate benefits, and have a non-forfeitable right to those benefits. It also establishes detailed funding rules that require retirement <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/plansponsor.asp\">plan sponsors</a> to provide adequate funding for the plan.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\"></span>\n", "\nIn addition to keeping participants informed of their rights, ERISA also grants participants the right to sue for benefits and breaches of fiduciary duty. To ensure that participants do not lose their retirement contributions if a defined-benefit pension plan is terminated, ERISA guarantees payment of certain benefits through a federally chartered corporation known as the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pbgc.asp\">Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC)</a>.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\"></span>\n", "\nERISA was enacted to address irregularities in the administration of certain large pension plans. These issues highlighted a lack of protections for workers. When Studebaker-Packard closed its Indiana factory in 1963, for example, more than 4,000 workers lost some or all of their pension plan benefits because the plan was underfunded.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"12\"></span>\n", "\nIn another high profile incident that took place in the 1960s, the Teamsters' Central States Pension Fund, which had a rather colorful history involving questionable loans to Las Vegas casinos, brought the issue of fiduciary malfeasance related to retirement accounts into the public eye.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"11\"></span>\n", "\nThe complicated rules of ERISA deter some small-business owners from setting up retirement accounts for their employees. To allow these companies to sidestep some of the confusing regulations, there are alternatives. A <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/simple-ira.asp\">SIMPLE IRA</a>, for example, is a retirement savings plan that most small businesses with 100 or fewer employees can use. SIMPLE stands for \"Savings Incentive Match Plans for Employees.\"<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"10\"></span>\n", "\nWhile SIMPLE IRAs <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/102714/are-simple-ira-plans-subject-erisa.asp\">are covered by ERISA</a>, they don't have the reporting and administrative burden that qualified retirement plans such as 401(k)s do, and they are easier to set up. With a SIMPLE IRA, the employer chooses and files the plan using IRS forms 5304-SIMPLE or 5305-SIMPLE. Employers must follow ERISA rules that dictate which employees are eligible and how a company handles employee contributions, and they are required to clearly spell out details of the plan's features within a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/summary-plan-description.asp\">summary plan description</a>.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"9\"></span>\n"]}
