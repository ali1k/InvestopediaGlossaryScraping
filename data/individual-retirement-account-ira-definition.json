Roth IRAs instead use after-tax contributions that grow tax-free into the future, but are subject to income limitations. SEP and SIMPLE IRAs are intended for business owners or self-employed individuals.\n", "\nYes, but you must be sure that the combined contributions to all your IRAs do not exceed the annual limit amount. You can also contribute to both an IRA and a 401(k) plan that is offered through your employer, which comes with its own set of rules, limitations, and qualifications.\n", "\nIRAs are meant to be long-term retirement savings accounts, and so they come with early-withdrawal penalties. If you take money out of an IRA before age 59\u00bd,<sub> </sub>you will be subject to a 10% penalty <em>and</em> must pay any deferred tax liability owed. So, if you withdraw $10,000 from a traditional IRA and are in the 25% tax bracket, you will pay a $1,000 penalty (10%) plus $2,500 taxes, leaving you with $6,500. There are certain qualified reasons for making an early withdrawal, such as for a first home or emergency medical expenses, that are not subject to the 10% penalty but would be taxed.\n", "\nNote that loans are not permitted from IRAs or from SEP and SIMPLE IRA plans. Loans are only possible from qualified plans such as 401(k) or 403(b) accounts. If the owner of an IRA does attempt to borrow from it, the account no longer is classified as an IRA and is subject to all penalties and taxes.\n", "\nIRA investments are self-directed, meaning you make all the investment choices. You may hold stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, and cash, among other assets. Note that certain investments, including life insurance, collectibles, such as art, antiques, gems, coins, or alcoholic beverages, are prohibited from being placed in an IRA, and IRAs can only invest in certain precious metals, such as gold, if they meet specific requirements.\u00a0\n", "\nAll IRA accounts require a named beneficiary. If you die before your IRA assets are drawn down, they will pass to your beneficiary. If that beneficiary is under the retirement age, they will be subject to the same IRA distribution and withdrawal rules. For a married couple, the beneficiary is the holder's spouse, unless the spouse agrees in writing that another beneficiary be named.\n"]}
