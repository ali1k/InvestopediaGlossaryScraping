Machines and computerized systems\u00a0can be configured to manufacture a variety of parts and\u00a0handle changing levels of production.\n", "\nA flexible manufacturing system (FMS) can improve efficiency and thus lower a company's <a class=\"CMY_Link CMY_Valid\" data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/production-cost.asp\">production cost</a>. Flexible manufacturing also can be a key component of a make-to-order strategy that allows customers to customize the products they want.\n", "\nSuch flexibility can come with higher upfront costs. Purchasing and installing the specialized equipment that allows for such customization may be costly compared with more traditional systems.\n", "\nThe concept of flexible manufacturing was developed by Jerome H. Lemelson (1923-97), an American industrial engineer and inventor who filed a number of related patents in the early 1950s. His original design was a robot-based system that could weld, rivet, convey, and inspect manufactured goods.\n", "\nSystems based on Lemelson's FMS inventions debuted on factory floors in the U.S. and Europe in the late 1960s and proliferated in the 1970s.\n", "\nA flexible manufacturing system may include a configuration of interconnected processing workstations with computer terminals that process the end-to-end creation of a product, from loading/unloading functions to machining and assembly to storing to quality testing and data processing. The system can be\u00a0programmed to run a batch\u00a0of one set of products in a particular quantity and then automatically switch over to another set of products in another quantity.\n", "\nA <a class=\"CMY_Link CMY_Valid\" data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/make-to-order.asp\">make-to-order</a> production process that allows customers to customize their products would also be an example of flexible manufacturing.\n", "\nThe main benefit is the enhancement of production efficiency. Downtime is reduced because the <a class=\"CMY_Link CMY_Valid\" data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/product-line.asp\">production line</a> does not have to be shut down to set up for\u00a0a different product.\n", "\nDisadvantages of FMS include its higher upfront costs and the greater time required to design the system specifications for a variety of future needs.\n", "\nThere also is a cost associated with the need for specialized technicians to run, monitor,\u00a0and maintain the FMS. Advocates of FMS maintain that the increase in automation typically results in a net reduction in labor costs.\n"]}
