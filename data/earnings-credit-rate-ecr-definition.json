The earnings credit rate is often correlated with the U.S. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurybill.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Treasury bill (T-bill)</a> rate.\n", "\nECRs are rates that banks impute to offset service charges.\u00a0Because depositors leave balances in non-interest bearing accounts, the bank will apply an ECR on those balances and use that as a credit for services.\u00a0For example, a corporate treasurer with a $250,000 collected balance receiving a 2% ECR would earn $5,000 to offset services.\u00a0ECR is often credited automatically.\n", "\nBanks may use ECRs to reduce fees customers pay for other banking services. These might include checking and savings accounts,\u00a0debit and credit cards,\u00a0business loans,\u00a0additional merchant services (such as credit card processing and check collection, reconciliation, and reporting),\u00a0and cash management services (e.g., <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/payroll.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">payroll</a>).\n", "\nECRs are paid on <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/idlefunds.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">idle funds</a>, which reduce bank <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/service-charge.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">service charges</a>. Customers with larger deposits and balances tend to pay lower bank fees. ECRs are visible on nearly the majority of U.S. commercial account analyses and billing statements.\n", "\nBanks may have great discretion for determining the earnings allowance. While the earnings credit rate can offset fees, depositors need to note that they are only being charged for services you use, not in\u00a0combination with others.\n", "\nThe notion of an earnings credit rate originated with <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/regulationq.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Regulation Q (Reg Q)</a>, which prohibited banks from paying interest on deposits in checking accounts (set up for transactional purposes). Following the 1933 <em><a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/glass_steagall_act.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Glass-Steagall Act</a>,</em> many hoped this practice would limit\u00a0loan sharking and other such predatory actions.\n", "\nThe act subsequently supported consumers in releasing funds from checking accounts and shifting them to money market funds. Following Regulation Q, many banks decided to offer \u201csoft dollar\u201d credits on these non-interest bearing accounts to offset banking services.\n", "\nTypically, the ECR is applied against\u00a0\"collected\" balances, not \"ledger\" or \"floating\" balances. Lockbox accounts and other depository accounts have float since it takes time for the deposits to clear. While these items are \"floating,\" the funds are not available. Collected balances are what you have cleared and available to transfer or invest.\n", "\nHistorically, banks set their earnings credit rate to approximate the 90-day T-bill rate.\u00a0Commercial banks also deducted a reserve requirement of up to 13%. In the mid-2000s, when the Fed lowered the reserve requirement to zero, many banks eliminated this <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/haircut.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">haircut</a>.\n", "\nAs of 2019,\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">interest rates</a> in the United States are projected to decline modestly. In contrast, the pace of earnings credit rate growth is not expected to keep the same pace.\n", "\nWhen money market funds yield near zero (e.g., during the 2008 financial crisis), deposit accounts offering ECRs, can become more attractive to corporate treasurers. Yet, in times of rising rates, these treasurers may look for <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financialinstrument.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">financial instruments</a>\u00a0with a higher yield\u00a0than ECRs. These could include money-market funds (once more) or even relatively safe and liquid <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bondfund.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bond funds</a>.\n"]}
