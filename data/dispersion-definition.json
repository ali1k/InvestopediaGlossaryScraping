In finance and investing, dispersion usually refers to the range of possible <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/return.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">returns</a> on an investment. It can also be used to measure the risk inherent in a particular security or investment portfolio.\n", "\nDispersion is often interpreted as a measure of the degree of uncertainty, and thus <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risk.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">risk</a>, associated with a particular security or investment <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/portfolio.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">portfolio</a>.\n", "\nInvestors\u00a0have thousands of potential <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">securities</a> to invest in and many factors to consider in choosing where to invest. One factor high on their list of considerations is the risk profile of the investment. Dispersion is one of many statistical measures to give perspective.\n", "\nThe dispersion of return on an asset shows the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volatility.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">volatility</a> and risk associated with holding that <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">asset</a>. The more variable the return on an asset, the more risky or volatile it is.\n", "\nFor example, an asset whose historical return in any given year ranges from +10% to -10% can be considered more volatile than an asset whose historical return ranges from +3% to -3% because its returns are more widely dispersed.\n", "\nThe primary risk measurement statistic, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beta.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">beta</a>, measures the dispersion of a security's return relative to a particular benchmark or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketindex.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">market index</a>, most frequently the U.S. S&amp;P 500 index. A beta measure of 1.0 indicates the investment moves in unison with the benchmark.\n", "\nA beta greater than 1.0 indicates the security is likely to experience moves greater than the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-market.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">market</a> as a whole\u2014a stock with a beta of 1.3 could be expected to experience moves that are 1.3x the market, meaning if the market is up 10%, the beta stock of 1.3 climbs 13%. The flip side is that if the market goes down, that security will likely go down more than the market, though there are no guarantees of the magnitude of the moves.\n", "\nA beta of less than 1.0 signifies a less dispersed return relative to the overall market. For example, a security with a beta of 0.87 will likely trail the overall market\u2014if the market is up 10%, then the investment with the lower beta would be expected to rise only 8.7%.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/alpha.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Alpha</a> is a statistic that measures a portfolio's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskadjustedreturn.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">risk-adjusted returns</a>\u2014that is, how much, more or less, did the investment return relative to the index or beta.\n", "\nA return higher than the beta indicates a positive alpha, usually attributed to the success of the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/portfoliomanager.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">portfolio manager</a> or model.
