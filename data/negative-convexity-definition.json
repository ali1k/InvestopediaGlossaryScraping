A bond's convexity is the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rateofchange.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">rate of change</a> of its duration, and it is measured as the second <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/derivative.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">derivative</a> of the bond's price with respect to its yield. Most mortgage bonds are negatively convex, and callable bonds usually exhibit negative convexity at lower yields.\n", "\nA bond's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duration.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">duration</a> refers to the degree to which a bond's price is impacted by the rise and fall of interest rates. Convexity demonstrates how the duration of a bond changes as the interest rate changes. Typically, when interest rates decrease, a bond's price increases. However, for bonds that have negative convexity, prices decrease as interest rates fall.\n", "\nFor example, with a callable bond, as interest rates fall, the incentive for the issuer to call the bond <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/at-par.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">at par</a> increases; therefore, its price will not rise as quickly as the price of a non-callable bond. The price of a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/callablebond.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">callable bond</a> might actually drop as the likelihood that the bond will be called increases. This is why the shape of a callable bond's curve of price with respect to yield is concave or negatively convex.\n", "\nSince duration is an imperfect price change estimator, investors, analysts, and traders calculate a bond's convexity. Convexity is a useful risk-management tool and is used to measure and manage a portfolio's exposure to market risk. This helps to increase the accuracy of price-movement predictions.\n", "\nWhile the exact formula for convexity is rather complicated, an approximation for convexity can be found using the following simplified formula:\n", "\nConvexity approximation = (P(+) + P(-) - 2 x P(0)) / (2 x P(0) x dy ^2)\n", "\nWhere:\n", "\nP(+) = bond price when interest rate is decreased\n", "\nP(-) = bond price when interest rate is increased\n", "\nP(0) = bond price\n", "\ndy = change in interest rate in decimal form\n", "\nFor example, assume a bond is currently priced at $1,000. If interest rates are decreased by 1%, the bond's new price is $1,035. If interest rates are increased by 1%, the bond's new price is $970. The approximate convexity would be:\n", "\nConvexity approximation = ($1,035 + $970 - 2 x $1,000) / (2 x $1,000 x 0.01^2) = $5 / $0.2 = 25\n", "\nWhen applying this to estimate a bond's price using duration a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/convexity-adjustment.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">convexity adjustment</a> must be used. The formula for the convexity adjustment is:\n", "\nConvexity adjustment = convexity x 100 x (dy)^2\n", "\nIn this example, the convexity adjustment would be:\n", "\nConvexity adjustment = 25 x 100 x (0.01)^2 = 0.25\n", "\nFinally, using duration and convexity to obtain an estimate of a bond's price for a given change in interest rates, an investor can use the following formula:\n", "\nBond price change = duration x yield change + convexity adjustment\n"]}
