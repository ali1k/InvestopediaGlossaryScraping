In most cases, investors pay different amounts of tax on investments based on the investment, how long the investment was held, and the investor's tax bracket. As a result, the two investors may face different after-tax rates of return on their investment, even if it is the same investment with the same nominal rate of return.\n", "\nAlso, different investments will have different tax rates applied to them.

Adjusting the nominal return to compensate for factors such as inflation allows you to determine how much of your nominal return is a real return. Conversely, the nominal rate of return strips out outside factors that can affect performance such as taxes and inflation.\n", "\nThe nominal rate of return doesn't include inflation or taxes when calculating the performance of an investment. For example, if an investment earned 10% over one year, but inflation was 2.5% for the same period, the actual rate of return would be 7.5%, or 10% - 2.5% inflation. Although the nominal rate return is an important metric when comparing the performance of multiple investments, it should be used in tandem with the real rate of return to make sure that investment gains are not being eroded by inflation or rising prices.\n"]}
