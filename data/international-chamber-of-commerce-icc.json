The ICC has hundreds of thousands of member companies\u00a0from more than 100 countries and broad business interests. The ICC's\u00a0vast networks of committees and experts belong to all sectors\u00a0and keep members fully informed of\u00a0all issues that affect their industries. They also\u00a0maintain\u00a0contact\u00a0with\u00a0the United Nations, the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wto.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">World Trade Organization</a>, and other intergovernmental agencies.\n", "\nThe ICC fosters international trade and commerce to promote and protect <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/open-market.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">open markets</a> for goods and services and the free flow of capital. The ICC\u00a0performs three primary activities: the establishment of rules, dispute resolution,\u00a0and policy advocacy. The ICC also wages war on commercial crime and corruption to bolster economic growth, create\u00a0jobs and stabilize\u00a0employment, and ensure overall economic prosperity. Because members of the ICC\u00a0and their associates engage\u00a0in international business, the ICC has unparalleled authority in setting rules that govern cross-border\u00a0business. While these rules are voluntary, thousands of daily transactions abide by the ICC-established rules\u00a0as part of regular <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/insights/what-is-international-trade/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">international trade</a>.\n", "\nThe ICC was founded in Paris, France in 1919. The organization\u2019s international secretariat was also established in Paris, and its International Court of Arbitration was formed in 1923. The first chairman of the chamber was Etienne Clementel, the early-20th-century French politician.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nThere are four primary governing bodies of the ICC. The lead governing body is the World Council, which is composed\u00a0of national committee representatives. The highest officers of the ICC, the chairman, and vice-chairman are elected by the World Council every two years.\u00a0\n", "\nThe executive board provides strategic direction for the ICC. The board is elected by the World Council and is comprised of 30 business leaders and ex-officio members. The executive board's prominent duties\u00a0are the development of ICC strategies and policy implementation.\n", "\nThe international secretariat is the operational arm\u00a0of the ICC and is\u00a0responsible for developing and implementing the ICC\u2019s work program and introducing business perspectives to intergovernmental organizations. The secretary-general, who is appointed by the World Council, oversees this governing body.\n", "\nThe finance committee acts as an advisor to the executive board on\u00a0all financial aspects. This committee prepares the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/budget.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">budget</a> on behalf of the board,\u00a0submits regular reports, reviews the financial implications of ICC activities,\u00a0and oversees\u00a0all expenses and revenue flow.\n"]}
