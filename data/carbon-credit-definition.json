One credit\u00a0permits the emission of a mass equal to one ton of carbon dioxide.\n", "\nThe carbon credit is one half of a so-called \"cap-and-trade\" program. Companies that pollute are awarded credits that allow them to continue to pollute up to a certain limit. That limit is reduced periodically. Meanwhile, the company may sell any unneeded credits to another company that needs them.\n", "\nPrivate companies are thus doubly incentivized to reduce greenhouse emissions. First, they will be fined if they exceed the cap. Second, they can make money by saving and reselling some of their emissions allowances.\n", "\nThe ultimate goal of carbon credits is to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.\n", "\nAs noted, a carbon credit is equal to one ton of carbon dioxide.
