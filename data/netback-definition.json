These costs include importing, transportation, marketing, production and refining costs, and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/royalty.asp\">royalty fees</a>.\n", "\nProducers with higher netback prices reflect a more operationally efficient oil company because they're receiving higher profits than their competitors from the materials produced.\n", "\nIt bears noting that netback is not a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gaap.asp\">Generally Accepted Accounting Principles</a> (GAAP) equation.

Differences in netback pricing can be caused by variations in production techniques, such as whether the company is participating in land-based or offshore operations, as well as with different locales.\n", "\nVarying regulations between nations can cause discrepancies in overall cost from one producer to the next. Any challenges posed by the political instability within a region can present unique issues regarding transportation or general safety.\n", "\nChanges in netback prices attributed to a single company over time can also demonstrate whether production is becoming more or less cost-effective. If a selected oil company\u2019s netback price has been increasing over time, it might be indicative of future success within the industry, while a company showing falling netback prices might be a cause for concern for investors.\n", "\nIt might cost an oil producer $125 to convert one barrel of light <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/crude-oil.asp\">crude oil</a> into heating oil, gasoline, diesel, and petrochemical byproducts.
