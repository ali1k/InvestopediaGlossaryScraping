Some researchers\u2014demographers William Straus and Neil Howe, for example\u2014place the exact birth years from\u00a01961 to 1981, whereas Gallup places the birth years between\u00a01965 and 1979.

Now you are at the point where your finances are probably a bit more complicated and one financial variable, such as the amount that you contribute to your company\u2019s 401(k) plan, can affect several other areas in ways that are becoming difficult to compute or predict with any accuracy.\n", "\nThis variable impact probably means that it is time to enlist a professional financial planner or financial advisor who can plug your cash flow, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancesheet.asp\">balance sheet</a>, risk tolerance, investment objectives, time horizon, and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxbracket.asp\">tax bracket</a> into a sophisticated financial-planning program.

But if you have not spoken with your parents about the state of their health and finances, then it\u2019s probably time to get the ball rolling in this area.

Requiring offspring who return home after college to help with household expenses\u2014 including paying rent, buying groceries, or assisting with the elders' care\u2014can relieve some of the pressure associated with supporting multiple generations.
