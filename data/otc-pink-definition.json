This marketplace offers to trade in a wide range of equities through any broker and includes companies in default or financial distress.\n", "\nSince it has no disclosure requirements, the categorization of OTC Pink companies is from information provided by the company. OTC Markets Group now markets OTC Pink as Pink Open Markets, but the historical name still persists.\n", "\nThe over-the-counter\u00a0(OTC) market is a decentralized market where securities, not listed on major exchanges, are traded directly by a network of\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dealer.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">dealers</a>.
