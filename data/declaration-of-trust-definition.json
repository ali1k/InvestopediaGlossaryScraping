These assets are held in a trust.\n", "\nThe document or statement also contains details of the trust's purpose, its beneficiaries, and how it will be managed by the trustee.\n", "\nThe declaration of trust is sometimes referred to as a nominee declaration.\n", "\nA declaration of trust not only appoints a trustee but defines the trust to be created in considerable detail.\n", "\nIt identifies the assets held within the trust.\u00a0It states who will benefit from the trust and who can amend or revoke the trust as well as the name of the trustee and what powers the trustee holds. The trustee may be a financial institution rather than an individual.\n", "\nThe statement may include instructions on how and when the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beneficiary.asp\">beneficiary</a> will receive distributions.\n", "\nThe declaration provides an overview of the trust's purpose or objectives and how the trustee may invest and manage assets to support the beneficiaries.

It is governed by the Trustee Act of 2000.\n", "\nWith a declaration of trust, an individual may be regarded as the owner of a property even if that person is not designated as the owner in the land registry. The trust itself can be cited in the land registry to show that the listed owner is not the sole owner of the property.\u00a0\n", "\nFor example, a person may purchase\u00a0a home with a mortgage. Some of the money towards the purchase may come from the person's parents. The parents would contribute towards the costs with the agreement that they will receive a share of any profit from the property's sale. The person creating the declaration of trust would be the registered owner on the title deeds of the property, but the parents can register their interests on the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trustdeed.asp\">trust deed</a>.\n"]}
