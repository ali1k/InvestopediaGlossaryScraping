Property insurance provides financial reimbursement to the owner or renter of a structure and its contents in case there is damage or theft\u2014and to a person other than the owner or renter if that person is injured on the property.\n", "\nProperty insurance can include a number of policies, such as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/homeowners-insurance.asp\">homeowners insurance</a>, renters insurance, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/flood-insurance.asp\">flood insurance</a>, and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/best-earthquake-insurance-5088359\">earthquake insurance</a>. Personal property is usually covered by a homeowners or renters policy. The exception is personal property that is very high value and expensive\u2014this is usually covered by purchasing an addition to the policy called a \"rider.\"\u00a0If there's a claim, the property insurance policy will either reimburse the policyholder for the actual value of the damage\u00a0or the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/replacementcost.asp\">replacement cost</a> to fix the problem.\n", "\nPerils covered by property insurance typically include select weather-related afflictions, including damage caused by fire, smoke, wind, hail, the impact of snow and ice, lightning, and more. Property insurance also protects against vandalism and theft, covering the structure and its contents. Property insurance also provides liability coverage in case someone other than the property owner or renter is injured while on the property\u00a0and decides to sue.\n", "\nProperty insurance policies normally exclude damage that results from\u00a0a variety of events, including tsunamis, floods, drain and sewer backups, seeping groundwater, standing water, and\u00a0a number of other sources of water. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/does-homeowners-insurance-cover-mold-4782771\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mold</a> is usually not covered, nor is the damage from an earthquake. In addition, most policies will not cover extreme circumstances, such as nuclear events, acts of war or terrorism.\n", "\nThere are three types of property insurance coverage: replacement cost, actual cash value, and extended replacement costs.\n", "\nMost homeowners purchase a hybrid policy that compensates for physical loss or damage caused by 16 perils, including fire, vandalism, and theft. The coverage, known as an HO3\u00a0policy, has certain conditions and exclusions. There is a predetermined limit on the coverage of certain valuables and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0911/should-you-insure-your-collectibles.aspx\">collectibles</a>, including gold, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/062615/it-worth-it-insure-my-wedding-ring.asp\">wedding rings</a> and other <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/072115/quick-guide-how-insure-jewelry.asp\">jewelry</a>, furs, cash, firearms, and other items. No coverage is usually provided in an HO3 for accidental breakage/damage and mysterious disappearance (lost, misplaced) of valuables, including fine art and antiques.\n", "\nHO5 homeowners coverage includes everything in an HO3 policy, but is geared toward the structure itself and the property within the home, including furniture, appliances, clothing, and other personal items. An HO5 doesn't cover for earthquakes or floods. HO5 insurance policies are available to homes that were either built in the\u00a0last 30 years or renovated in the last\u00a040 years, and they typically cover any damages at replacement cost.\n", "\nHO4\u00a0property insurance\u00a0is usually known as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/renters-insurance.asp\">renter's insurance</a>\u2014it covers tenants from loss of personal property and liability coverage. It does not cover the actual house or apartment being rented, which\u00a0should be\u00a0covered by the landlord\u2019s insurance policy.\n", "\nNote that none of these coverage levels reimburses the homeowner for property that breaks down or is damaged in more normal wear-and-tear situations, such as a roof that begins to leak without damage from wind and hail.
