One who works in the field of gemology is called a gemologist, and jewelers and goldsmiths also may be gemologists.\n", "\nSome collectors and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investor.asp\">investors</a> may be interested only in gems' monetary value, but to distinguish one gemstone from another, they will need to seek out a gemologist. Gemologists examine gemstones\u2014both discovered raw and synthesized in the laboratory\u2014using microscopes, computerized tools, and other grading instruments.\n", "\nAt its heart, gemology is about identifying gems. Gemologists identify a gemstone by its specific characteristics and properties, such as cut, color, quality, and clarity. Some rubies and garnets, for example, are impossible to distinguish by their appearance, but their underlying physical properties differ considerably. Many people are familiar with a group of criteria that is used in gemology to identify <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/diamonds.asp\">diamonds</a>\u2014the 4Cs of color, clarity, cut, and carat.\n", "\nIn addition to gemologists, the field of gemology contains numerous other professionals, including appraisers, jewelers, lapidaries, metalworkers, and scientists.\n", "\nGemologists may become certified as professional appraisers, whose expertise is useful in many other industries, including jewelry sales and investing. Jewelers need to understand gemology to answer their customers\u2019 questions and identify any gems brought to them. Goldsmiths and other metalworkers need specific knowledge about the physical characteristics of gems to create appropriate settings. For example, a setting that would be ideal for a diamond could damage an opal, and the amount of pressure used to set the prongs on a garnet could break a stone of tanzanite.\n", "\nLapidaries, or gem cutters, also need special knowledge, as appropriate cutting and polishing techniques vary from gem to gem. What would work well for one gemstone would be a waste of time or even disastrous for another gem. Scientists with degrees in geology, chemistry, and even physics make up the smallest group of gemologists, although they are very influential. Scientists add to gemology's knowledge base by developing new testing techniques and researching new gemstones.\n", "\nWhen returns in the stock market decline, aggressive investors often seek out alternatives that may hold more promise of increasing returns on invested capital (ROIC) than traditional investment types. Or, some investors might want to consider <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/041615/why-should-you-invest-tangible-assets.asp\">tangible assets</a> simply as a way to diversify their holdings even during good market conditions. Investing in gemstones\u2014in particular, those that are rare or of exceptional quality\u2014likely would at least retain, and probably increase in value.\n", "\nHowever, unlike other types of investments, gemstones may not be as easily liquidated if you have an urgent need for cash. This\u00a0drawback is especially founded for rare, precious stones and jewelry that would appeal to elite buyers only.\u00a0Gemstone investing can seem exciting to those who want to make quick returns, but it is highly speculative and should only be undertaken\u00a0by experienced professionals. Investing in the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/09/precious-metals-gold-silver-platinum.asp\">precious metals</a> sector, however, is different because there are standards as well as specific investment vehicles for them in the financial markets.\n", "\nThe term \"investment-grade\" is often tossed around by those who want to sell gems or try to convince other people to invest in them. However, this practice is frowned upon in financial services because there are no formal standards for what constitutes investment-grade gemstones, as there are for investment-grade bonds, for example.\n", "\nWith advances in gemstone synthesis, gemology has become an important field of study. A credential in gemology can offer numerous career paths:\n"]}
