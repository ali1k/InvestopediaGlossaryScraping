All of these types of organizations must effectively assess the\u00a0economic climate\u00a0in order to remain solvent (because\u00a0all organizations require a source of funding to continue operations).\u00a0Across all sectors of the business world, the main goal of managerial economics is to use all available resources within an organization, specifically maximizing production while at the same time minimizing any waste.\n", "\nWhile nonprofit organizations and for-profit organizations may have different goals, both of these types of organizations perform similar business functions and require similar expertise. In addition, they must also strive\u00a0to limit waste and maximize the overall usefulness of their available resources in order to maintain their viability as enterprises.\n", "\nBoth nonprofit organizations and for-profit organizations have to maintain the necessary capital to continue working within the economy; this requires them to use many of the same principles.
