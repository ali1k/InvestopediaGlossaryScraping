A capitalization table is most commonly utilized for startups and early-stage businesses but all types of companies may use it as well. In general, the capitalization table is an intricate breakdown of a company\u2019s shareholders\u2019 equity.\n", "\nCap tables often include all of a company\u2019s equity ownership capital, such as common equity shares, preferred equity shares, warrants, and convertible equity.\n", "\nA basic capitalization table lists out each type of equity ownership capital, the individual investors, and the share prices. A more complex table may also include details on potential new funding sources, mergers and acquisitions, public offerings,\u00a0or other hypothetical transactions.\n", "\nCapitalization tables are typically used privately by private companies to provide information on a company\u2019s investors and market value. Below is one example of a capitalization table.\n", "\nOverall, a capitalization table shows the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/110613/market-value-versus-book-value.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">total market value</a> of a company and its components. As a key point of reference for business managers, the capitalization table is considered in every financial decision that has an impact on\u00a0market capitalization and the company\u2019s market value. As such, it is important for the capitalization table to be accurate, customized to the business needs, and regularly maintained for decision making based on the most current information.\n", "\nComparatively, it can be viewed in conjunction with the shareholders\u2019 equity portion of the balance sheet, which also details the equity capital structuring of a firm.\n", "\nThe capitalization table shows each investors\u2019 equity capital stake in the business, which is calculated by multiplying the share price by the number of shares owned. In most cases, the names of the security owners will be listed on the Y-axis and the types of securities on the X-axis. In addition, all holdings of each investor should be in a single row.\n", "\nThe listing of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investor.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">investors</a> can be done in a few different ways and may depend on the targeted audience. Some capitalization tables may list investors by founders first, followed by executives and key employees with\u00a0equity\u00a0stakes, then other investors, such as\u00a0angel investors, venture capital\u00a0firms, and others who are involved in the business plan. Alternatively, a capitalization table may choose to list investors in descending order by ownership, showing the largest holders at the top.\n", "\nCompanies are constantly evolving, and so their capitalization tables must be continuously updated as well. For example, startups run several funding rounds to support capital needs. They also issue stock options to attract talent.\u00a0All of these actions change the capitalization table.\n", "\nLikewise, terminating options when an employee leaves the business, letting options expire, having an investor exercise vested options,\u00a0or having an investor redeem, transfer, or sell shares are also instances that alter the table.\n"]}
