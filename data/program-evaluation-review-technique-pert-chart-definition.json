The Program Evaluation Review Technique (PERT) breaks down the individual\u00a0tasks of a project for analysis.\u00a0PERT charts are considered preferable to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gantt-chart.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gantt charts</a> because they identify task dependencies, but they're often more difficult to interpret.\n", "\nA PERT chart helps a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/professionals/113015/project-manager-career-path-qualifications.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">project manager</a> analyze a project's tasks and estimate the amount of time required to complete each task in the project. Using this information, the project manager can estimate the minimum amount of time required to complete the entire project. This information also helps the manager develop a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/budget.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">project budget</a> and determine the resources needed to accomplish the project.\n", "\nA PERT chart uses\u00a0circles or rectangles called nodes to represent project events or milestones. These nodes are linked by vectors or lines that represent various tasks. Dependent tasks are items that must be performed in a specific manner. For example, if an arrow is drawn from Task No. 1 to Task No. 2 on a PERT chart, Task No. 1 must be completed before work on Task No. 2 begins.\n", "\nItems at the same stage of production but on different task lines within a project are referred to as parallel tasks. They're independent of\u00a0each other, but they're planned to occur at the same time.\n", "\nA well-constructed PERT chart looks like this:\n", "\nA PERT chart is a visual representation of a series of events that must occur within the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/scope.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">scope</a> of a project\u2019s lifetime. The direction of arrows indicates the flow and sequence of events required for project completion. Dotted activity lines represent dummy activities\u2014items that are located on another PERT path. Numbers and time allotments are assigned and shown\u00a0inside each vector.\n", "\nThese charts have their distinct definitions and terms, the most important of which anticipate how long it will take to finalize a project. \"Optimistic time\" refers to the shortest duration. \"Pessimistic time\" is logically the longest it might take. The \"most likely time\" indicates a reasonable estimate of the best-case scenario, whereas \"expected time\" accounts for problems and obstacles.\n", "\nA PERT chart is similar to a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/critical-path-analysis-cpa.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">critical path analysis</a> (CPA), which is another method that project managers use to chart tasks in a project. The main difference between the two is that a PERT chart uses various time frames and probability terms when estimating each project stage. As a project management tool, PERT charts offer some distinct advantages and disadvantages.\n", "\nA PERT chart allows managers to evaluate the time and resources necessary to manage a project. This evaluation includes the ability to track <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/core-assets.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">required assets</a> during any stage of production in the course of the entire project.\n", "\nPERT analysis incorporates data and information from multiple departments. This combining of information encourages department responsibility and it identifies all responsible parties across the organization. It also improves communication during the project and it allows an organization to commit\u00a0to projects that are relevant to its\u00a0strategic positioning.\n", "\nFinally, PERT charts are useful for\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sensitivityanalysis.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">what-if analyses</a>. Understanding the\u00a0possibilities concerning the flow of project resources and milestones allows management to achieve the most efficient and useful project path.\n", "\nThe use of a PERT chart is highly subjective and its success depends on the management\u2019s experience. These charts can include unreliable data or unreasonable estimations for cost or time for this reason.\n", "\nPERT charts are deadline-focused and\u00a0they might not fully communicate the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/fundamental/04/063004.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">financial positioning</a> of a project. Because a PERT chart is labor-intensive, the establishment and maintenance of the information require\u00a0additional time and resources. Continual review of the information provided, as well as the prospective positioning of the project, is required for a PERT chart to be valuable.\n", "\nPERT charts were first created by the U.S. Navy's Special Projects Office in 1957 to guide the Polaris Fleet Ballistic Missile project. Using the PERT model, Navy project managers were able to evaluate the progress of their project, determine the validity of schedules, and estimate the effects of proposed changes to established plans. <span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff The success of this initial use of PERT charts has caused them to be used ever since all over the world and in numerous industries.\n"]}
