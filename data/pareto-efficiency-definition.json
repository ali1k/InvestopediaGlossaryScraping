Pareto efficiency implies that resources are <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/allocationalefficiency.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">allocated</a> in the most <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economic_efficiency.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">economically efficient</a> manner, but does not imply equality or fairness. An economy is said to be in a Pareto optimum state when no economic changes can make one individual better off without making at least one other individual worse off.\n", "\nPareto efficiency, named after the Italian economist and political scientist Vilfredo Pareto (1848-1923), is a major pillar of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/welfare_economics.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">welfare economics</a>. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/neoclassical.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Neoclassical economics</a>, alongside the theoretical construct of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/perfectcompetition.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">perfect competition</a>, is used as a benchmark to judge the efficiency of real markets\u2014though neither perfectly efficient nor perfectly competitive markets occur outside of economic theory.\n", "\nHypothetically, if there were perfect competition and resources were used to maximum efficient capacity, then everyone would be at their highest standard of living, or Pareto efficiency. Economists Kenneth Arrow and Gerard Debreu demonstrated, theoretically, that under the assumption of perfect competition and where all goods and services are tradeable in competitive markets with zero <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/transactioncosts.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">transaction costs</a>, an economy will tend toward Pareto efficiency.\n", "\nIn any situation other than Pareto efficiency, some changes to the allocation of resources in an economy can be made, such that at least one individual gains and no individuals lose from the change. Only changes in allocation of resources that meet this condition are considered moves toward Pareto efficiency. Such a change is called a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/paretoimprovement.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pareto improvement</a>.\n", "\nA Pareto improvement occurs when a change in allocation harms no one and helps at least one person, given an initial allocation of goods for a set of persons. The theory suggests that Pareto improvements will keep enhancing value to an economy until it achieves a Pareto equilibrium, where no more Pareto improvements can be made. Conversely, when an economy is at Pareto efficiency, any change to the allocation of resources will make at least one individual worse off.\n", "\nIn practice, it is almost impossible to take any social action, such as a change in economic policy, without making at least one person worse off, which is why other criteria of economic efficiency have found a wider use in economics.\n", "\nThese include the following:\n", "\nThese alternative criteria for economic efficiency all to some extent relax the strict requirements of pure Pareto efficiency in the pragmatic interest of real world policy and decision making.\n", "\nAside from applications in economics, the concept of Pareto improvements can be found in many scientific fields, where trade-offs are simulated and studied to determine the number and type of reallocation of resource variables necessary to achieve Pareto efficiency.\n", "\nIn the business world, factory managers may run Pareto improvement trials, in which they reallocate labor resources to try to boost the productivity of assembly workers without, for example, decreasing the productivity of the packing and shipping workers.\n"]}
