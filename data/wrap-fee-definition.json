These services may include investment advice, investment research, and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brokerage-company.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">brokerage services</a>. Wrap fees allow an investment professional to charge one straightforward fee rather than imposing multiple charges on their clients. By doing so, they are able to simplify the process for both themselves and their customers. Wrap fees apply to all-inclusive accounts called wrap accounts.\n", "\nA <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wrapaccount.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">wrap account</a> is a comprehensive investment option that bundles different <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">securities</a> and funds together into a single <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/portfolio.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">portfolio</a>.

Wrap accounts are ideal for investors who want the flexibility of choosing their investments while allowing a professional to manage their portfolio. These accounts help simplify the investment process, which is why they come with one, comprehensive fee called a wrap fee.\n", "\nPaying a wrap fee can be a great option for investors who intend to use their broker's full line of services because it pays for all the direct services the customer receives.

The fee also covers the administrative costs incurred by investment firms, which tend to be a full-service brokerage or affiliated or unaffiliated <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/broker-dealer.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">broker-dealer</a> firms.\n", "\nWrap fees are set up to be a percentage of the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aum.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">assets under management</a> (AUM). This amount ranges from 1% to 3%. Because of the high cost, investors should decide how cost-effective a wrap account is for their financial situation. Investors with simple needs or for those who can't afford a wrap account may find it cheaper to pay an investment professional for individual services in an unbundled arrangement.\n", "\nWrap fee programs can have a variety of names, such as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetallocation.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">asset allocation</a> programs, investment management programs, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetmanagement.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">asset management</a> programs, separately managed accounts, and mini-accounts.
