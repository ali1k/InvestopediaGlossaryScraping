The bank issued a total of eight series of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/banknote.asp\">banknotes</a>, including the October 2018, issued of a new 50-<em>krone </em>and 500-<em>krone </em>bills. Consumers may still use the 50-<em>krone </em>and 500-<em>krone </em>banknotes from the previous series until 18 October 2019.\n", "\nThe Norwegian <em>krone</em>, or <em>kroner </em>for the plural term, subdivides into 100 <em>\u00f8re</em>. The word <em>krone\u00a0</em>translates into English as the crown. Coins come in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/denomination.asp\">denominations</a> of 1, 5, 10, and 20 <em>krone </em>and banknotes appear as in denominations of 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1,000 <em>kroner</em>. The currency code for NOK is \u201cISK,\u201d and the currency symbol is \u201ckr.\u201d\n", "\nBanknotes feature prominent Norwegians such as noted scientists and artists on the front of the currency, along with information indicating the specific person\u2019s contribution to Norwegian culture. The back of each bill depicts some aspect of Norwegian art. For example, the 50-<em>krone </em>note contains a green tint, a portrait of Peter Christen Asbj\u00f8rnsen on the front and an artist\u2019s rendering of Asbj\u00f8rnsen\u2019s story <em>A Summer Night in Krogskogen</em>.\n", "\nThe first circulation of the <em>krone </em>came in 1875 when it became the replacement of the <em>speciedaler. </em>At this time, the conversion rate was four <em>kroner </em>for one <em>speciedaler</em>. Following the switch, Norway joined the Scandinavian Monetary Union, an alliance which existed until the outbreak of World War I. During the existence of the Union, the Norwegian <em>krone </em>acted as the gold standard with one kilogram of gold equivalent to 2,480 <em>kroner</em>. Use of the NOK as a gold standard ended in 1931.\n", "\nIn 1939 the country's currency pegged to the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/usd.asp\">U.S. dollar</a> (USD), but while occupied by Germany during the Second World War, it pegged to the Reichsmark. At the war's end, the currency pegged to the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gbp.asp\">British pound</a> (GBP). In 1992, the central bank moved away from a fixed exchange rate, allowing the currency to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/floatingexchangerate.asp\">float </a>based on the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/forex/i/international-currency-exchange-rates.asp\">foreign currency exchange rate</a>.\n", "\nAs with all currencies, economic trends trigger fluctuation in the value of the Norwegian <em>krone</em>. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/031615/safest-currencies-world.asp\">Currency investors may seek out the NOK</a> when the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/euro.asp\">euro\u2019s</a> (EUR) value is in doubt. Increased activity in trading the NOK may increase the rate of exchange. Changes in the global price of crude oil also affect the NOK's value as Norway is Western Europe\u2019s leading oil exporter.\n", "\nNorway's shipping, hydroelectric power, fishing and manufacturing all contribute to the country's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gdp.asp\">gross domestic product</a> (GDP). However, it is interesting to note many industries are <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/soe.asp\">state-owned</a>. Historically, the <em>krone </em>is a prudent investment as, Norway stakes claim to one of Europe\u2019s most stable economies.\n", "\nNorway is one of the wealthiest countries on the globe and enjoys one of the highest standards of living. According to the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://databank.worldbank.org/data/reports.aspx?source=2&amp;country=NOR\">2017 World Bank data</a>, Norway has a high-income economy with slow population growth at 0.9% annually. The yearly gross domestic product growth per year is at 1.9% while the inflation deflator is at 3.8% yearly.\n"]}
