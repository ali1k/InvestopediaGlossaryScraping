Public companies in the United States must follow GAAP when their accountants compile their financial statements. GAAP is a combination of authoritative standards (set by policy boards) and the commonly accepted ways of recording and reporting accounting information. GAAP aims to improve the clarity, consistency, and comparability of the communication of financial information.\n", "\nGAAP may be contrasted with <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proforma.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pro forma</a> accounting, which is a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/non-gaap-earnings.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">non-GAAP</a> financial reporting method. Internationally, the equivalent to GAAP in the United States is referred to as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ifrs.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">International Financial Reporting Standards</a> (IFRS). IFRS is followed in over 120 countries, including those in the European Union (EU).<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"7\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nGAAP helps govern the\u00a0world of accounting according to general rules and guidelines. It attempts to standardize and regulate the definitions, assumptions,\u00a0and methods used in accounting across all industries. GAAP covers such topics as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/revenuerecognition.asp\">revenue recognition</a>, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancesheet.asp\">balance sheet</a> classification, and materiality.\n", "\nThe ultimate goal of GAAP is to ensure a company's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-statements.asp\">financial statements</a> are complete, consistent, and comparable. This makes it easier for investors to analyze and extract useful information from the company's financial statements, including trend data over a period of time. It also facilitates the comparison of financial information across different companies.\n", "\nThese 10 general concepts can help you remember the main mission of GAAP:\n", "\nThe accountant has adhered to GAAP rules and regulations as a standard.\n", "\nAccountants commit to applying the same standards throughout the reporting process, from one period to the next, to ensure financial comparability between periods. Accountants are expected to fully disclose and explain the reasons behind any changed or updated standards in the\u00a0footnotes to the financial statements.\n", "\nThe accountant strives to provide an accurate and impartial depiction of a company\u2019s financial situation.\n", "\nThe procedures used in financial reporting should be consistent, allowing comparison of the company's financial information.\n", "\nBoth negatives and positives should be reported with full transparency and without the expectation of debt compensation.\n", "\nThis refers to emphasizing fact-based financial data representation that is not clouded by speculation.\n", "\nWhile valuing assets, it should be assumed the business will continue to operate.\n", "\nEntries should be distributed across the appropriate periods of time. For example, revenue should be reported in its relevant <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accountingperiod.asp\">accounting period</a>.\n", "\nAccountants must strive to fully disclose all financial data and accounting information in financial reports.\n", "\nDerived from the Latin phrase \u201c<em>uberrimae fidei\u201d</em> used within the insurance industry. It presupposes that parties remain honest in all transactions.\n", "\nIf a corporation's stock is <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/publiccompany.asp\">publicly traded</a>, its financial statements must adhere to rules established by the U.S. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp\">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC). The SEC requires that publicly traded companies in the U.S. regularly file GAAP-compliant financial statements in order to remain publicly listed on the stock exchanges.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"8\"></span> GAAP compliance is ensured through an appropriate <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/auditors-opinion.asp\">auditor's opinion</a>, resulting from an external audit by a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cpa.asp\">certified public accounting</a> (CPA) firm.\n", "\nAlthough it is not required for non-publicly traded companies, GAAP is viewed favorably by lenders and creditors. Most financial institutions will require annual GAAP-compliant financial statements as a part of their debt <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/covenant.asp\">covenants</a> when issuing business loans. As a result, most companies in the United States do follow GAAP.\n", "\nIf a financial statement is not prepared using GAAP, investors should be cautious. Without GAAP, comparing financial statements of different companies would be extremely difficult, even within the same industry, making an apples-to-apples comparison hard. Some companies may report both GAAP and non-GAAP measures when reporting their financial results. GAAP regulations require that non-GAAP measures be identified in financial statements and other public disclosures, such as press releases.\n", "\nThe <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hierarchy-of-gaap.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hierarchy of GAAP</a> is designed to improve financial reporting. It consists of a framework for selecting the principles that public accountants should use in preparing financial statements in line with U.S. GAAP. The hierarchy is broken down as follows:\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accountant.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Accountants</a> are directed to first consult sources at the top of the hierarchy and then proceed to lower levels only if there is no relevant pronouncement at a higher level. The FASB's Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 162 provides a detailed explanation of the hierarchy.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nGAAP is focused on the accounting and financial reporting of U.S. companies. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), an independent nonprofit organization, is responsible for establishing these accounting and financial reporting standards.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff The international alternative to GAAP is the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), set by the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ias.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">International Accounting Standards Board</a> (IASB).<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nThe IASB and the FASB have been working on the convergence of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/09/ifrs-gaap.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">IFRS and GAAP</a> since 2002.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff Due to the progress achieved in this partnership, the SEC, in 2007, removed the requirement for non-U.S. companies registered in America to reconcile their financial reports with GAAP if their accounts already complied with IFRS.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"5\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff This was a big achievement, because prior to the ruling, non-U.S. companies trading on U.S. exchanges had to provide GAAP-compliant financial statements.\n", "\nSome differences that still exist between both accounting rules include:\n", "\nAs corporations increasingly need to navigate global markets and conduct operations worldwide, international standards are becoming increasingly popular at the expense of GAAP, even in the U.S. Almost all S&amp;P 500 companies report at least one non-GAAP measure of earnings as of 2019.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"9\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\n<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"6\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nGAAP is only a set of standards. Although these principles work to improve the transparency in financial statements, they do not provide any guarantee that a company's financial statements are free from errors or omissions that are intended to mislead investors. There is plenty of room within GAAP for unscrupulous accountants to distort figures. So even when a company uses GAAP, you still need to scrutinize its financial statements.\n", "\nGAAP is a set of procedures and guidelines used by companies to prepare their financial statements and other accounting disclosures. The standards are prepared by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), which is an independent non-profit organization. The purpose of GAAP standards is to help ensure that the financial information provided to investors and regulators is accurate, reliable, and consistent with one-another.\n", "\nGAAP is important because it helps maintain trust in the financial markets. If not for GAAP, investors would be more reluctant to trust the information presented to them by companies because they would have less confidence in its integrity. Without that trust, we might see fewer transactions, potentially leading to higher transaction costs and a less robust economy. GAAP also helps investors analyze companies by making it easier to perform \u201capples to apples\u201d comparisons between one company and another.\n", "\nCompanies are still allowed to present certain figures without abiding by GAAP guidelines, provided that they clearly identify those figures as not conforming to GAAP. Companies sometimes do so when they believe that the GAAP rules are not flexible enough to capture certain nuances about their operations. In that situation, they might provide specially-designed non-GAAP metrics, in addition to the other disclosures required under GAAP. Investors should be skeptical about non-GAAP measures, however, as they can sometimes be used in a misleading manner.\n"]}
