This is because the company can pledge some assets if it is required to raise cash to tide over the liquidity squeeze. This route may not be available for a company that is technically insolvent because a liquidity crisis would exacerbate its financial situation and force it into bankruptcy.\n", "\nIn contrast to liquidity ratios,\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/solvencyratio.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">solvency\u00a0ratios</a> measure a company's ability to meet its total financial obligations and long-term debts. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/solvency.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Solvency</a> relates to a company's overall ability to pay debt obligations and continue business operations, while liquidity focuses more on current or short-term financial accounts. A company must have more total assets than total liabilities to be solvent; a company must have more current assets than current liabilities to be\u00a0liquid. Although solvency does not relate directly to liquidity, liquidity ratios present a preliminary expectation regarding a company's solvency.\n", "\nThe solvency ratio is calculated by dividing a company's\u00a0net income\u00a0and\u00a0depreciation\u00a0by its short-term and\u00a0long-term liabilities. This indicates whether a company's net income is able to cover its\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/total-liabilities.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">total liabilities</a>. Generally, a company with a higher solvency ratio is considered to be a more favorable investment.\n", "\nLet's use a couple of these liquidity ratios to demonstrate their effectiveness in assessing a company's financial condition.\n", "\nConsider two hypothetical companies\u2014Liquids Inc. and Solvents Co.\u2014with the following assets and liabilities on their <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancesheet.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">balance sheets</a> (figures in millions of dollars).\u00a0We assume that both companies operate in the same manufacturing sector (i.e., industrial glues and solvents).\n", "\nNote that in our example, we will assume that current liabilities only consist of\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accountspayable.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">accounts payable</a>\u00a0and other liabilities, with no short-term debt.\n", "\nWe can draw a number of conclusions about the financial condition of these two companies from these ratios.\n", "\nLiquids, Inc. has a high degree of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">liquidity</a>. Based on its current ratio, it has $3 of current assets for every dollar of current liabilities. Its quick ratio points to adequate liquidity even after excluding inventories, with $2 in assets that can be converted rapidly to cash for every dollar of current liabilities.\n", "\nHowever, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dfl.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">financial leverage</a> based on its solvency ratios appears quite high. Debt exceeds equity by more than three times, while two-thirds of assets have been financed by debt. Note as well that close to half of non-current assets consist of\u00a0intangible assets (such as goodwill and patents). As a result, the ratio of debt to tangible assets\u2014calculated as ($50/$55)\u2014is 0.91, which means that over 90% of tangible assets (plant, equipment, and inventories, etc.) have been financed by borrowing. To summarize, Liquids, Inc. has a comfortable liquidity position, but it has a dangerously high degree of leverage.\n", "\nSolvents, Co. is in a different position. The company's current ratio of 0.4 indicates an\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/11/understanding-liquidity-risk.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">inadequate degree of liquidity</a>, with only $0.40 of current assets available to cover every $1 of current liabilities. The quick ratio suggests an even more dire liquidity position, with only $0.20 of liquid assets for every $1 of current liabilities.\n", "\nFinancial leverage, however, appears to be at comfortable levels, with debt at only 25% of equity and only 13% of assets financed by debt. Even better, the company's asset base consists wholly of tangible assets, which means that Solvents, Co.'s ratio of debt to tangible assets is about one-seventh that of Liquids, Inc. (approximately 13% vs. 91%). Overall, Solvents, Co. is in a dangerous liquidity situation, but it has a comfortable debt position.\n", "\nLiquidity refers to how easily or efficiently cash can be obtained in order to pay bills and other short-term obligations. Assets that can be readily sold, like stocks and bonds, are also considered to be liquid (although cash is, of course, the most liquid asset of all). Businesses need enough liquidity on hand to cover their bills and obligations so that they can pay vendors, keep up with payroll, and keep their operations going day-in and day-out.\n", "\nLiquidity refers to the ability to cover short-term obligations. Solvency, on the other hand, is a firm's ability to pay long-term obligations. For a firm, this will often include being able to repay interest and principal on debts (such as bonds) or long-term leases.\n", "\nFundamentally, all liquidity ratios measure a firm's ability to cover short-term obligations by dividing current assets by current liabilities (CL). The cash ratio looks at only the cash on hand divided by CL, while the quick ratio adds in cash equivalents (like money market holdings) as well as marketable securities and accounts receivable. The current ratio includes all current assets. Thus, the different ratios differ in how conservative they are: While it is relatively easy to sell stocks, it may take a day or two to clear. Cash, however, is already available to pay bills.\n", "\nIn this case, a\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity-crisis.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">liquidity crisis</a>\u00a0can arise even at healthy companies\u2014if circumstances arise that make it difficult to meet short-term obligations, such as repaying their loans and paying their employees or suppliers. One example of a far-reaching liquidity crisis from recent history is the global credit crunch of 2007-09, where many companies found themselves unable to secure short-term financing to pay their immediate obligations. If new financing cannot be found, the company may be forced to liquidate assets in a fire sale or seek bankruptcy protection.\n"]}
