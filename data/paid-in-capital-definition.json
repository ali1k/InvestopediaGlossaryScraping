If not distinguished as its own line item, there will be a debit to cash for the total amount received and credits to common or preferred stock and additional paid-in capital.\n", "\nCommon stock is a component of paid-in capital, which is the total amount received from investors for stock. On the balance sheet, the par value of outstanding shares is recorded to common stock, and the excess (market price - par value) is recorded to additional paid-in capital.
