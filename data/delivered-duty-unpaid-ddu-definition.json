Once the goods arrive at the agreed-upon location, the buyer becomes responsible for paying import duties,\u00a0as well as further transport costs.

However, DDU is\u00a0still commonly used in international trade parlance.\u00a0On paper, the term is followed by the location of delivery; for example, \"DDU: Port of Los Angeles.\"\u00a0\n", "\nAccording to DDU arrangements, the seller secures licenses and takes care of other formalities involved in exporting a good; it is also responsible for all licenses and costs incurred in transit countries, as well as providing\u00a0an invoice at its own cost. The seller assumes all risk until the goods are delivered to the specified location, but it has no obligation to obtain insurance on the goods.\u00a0\n", "\nThe buyer is responsible for obtaining all necessary licenses for importing the goods and paying all relevant taxes, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duty.asp\">duties</a>, and inspection costs. All risks involved in this process are borne\u00a0by the buyer. Once the goods are placed at the disposal of the buyer, all further transportation costs and risks fall on the buyer.\n", "\n\u200bThe <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/international-chamber-of-commerce-icc.asp\">International Chamber of Commerce</a> (ICC) is an organization that was originally formed after\u00a0World War I with the goal of fostering prosperity in Europe\u00a0by setting standards for international trade. It was this group that, in 1936, published a set of standardized terms for different types of shipping agreements, known as Incoterms.\n", "\nIncoterms\u00a0are contract specifications outlining who bears the costs and risks of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/insights/what-is-international-trade/\">international transactions</a>; they\u00a0are subject to change at the discretion of the ICC.\u00a0Because of the legal and logistical intricacies of international shipping, the ICC seeks to simplify matters for businesses by standardizing its terms. 2020 Incoterms revision is <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://2go.iccwbo.org/incoterms-2020-eng-config+book_version-eBook\" rel=\"nofollow\">available for purchase</a> direct from the site.\n"]}
