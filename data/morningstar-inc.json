At the same time, the mutual fund industry started to accelerate as retirement plans\u00a0shifted from defined benefit like company pensions to defined contribution. These changing dynamics informed the foundation of Morningstar. Over the next 30 years, Morningstar continued to add products and services that help investors of various\u00a0expertise. Today, Joe Mansueto\u00a0is no longer the CEO of Morningstar but still holds the\u00a0position of executive chairman.\n"]}
