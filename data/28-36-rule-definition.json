According to this rule, a household should spend a maximum of 28% of its <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/grossincome.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">gross monthly income</a> on total housing expenses and no more than 36% on total debt service, including housing and other debt such as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/auto-loans-4689734\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">car loans</a> and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditcard.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">credit cards</a>. Lenders often use this rule to assess whether to extend credit to borrowers.\n", "\nLenders use different criteria to determine whether to approve <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-application.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">credit applications</a>. One of the main considerations is an individual's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit_score.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">credit score</a>. They usually require that a credit score falls within a certain range before considering credit approval. However, a credit score is not the only consideration. Lenders also consider a borrower\u2019s income and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dti.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">debt-to-income</a> (DTI) ratio.\n", "\nAnother factor is the 28/36, which is an important calculation that determines a consumer's financial health. It helps determine how much debt a consumer can safely assume based on their income, other debts, and financial needs\u2014the premise being that debt loads in excess of the 28/36 parameters are likely difficult for an individual or household to sustain and may eventually lead to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/default2.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">default</a>. This rule is a guide lenders use to structure <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underwriting.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">underwriting</a> requirements. Some lenders may vary these parameters based on a borrower\u2019s credit score, potentially allowing high credit score borrowers to have slightly higher DTI ratios.\n", "\nLenders that use the 28/36 rule in their credit assessment may include questions about housing expenses and comprehensive debt accounts in their credit application. Each lender establishes his or her own parameters for housing debt and total debt as a part of their underwriting program. This means that household expense payments, primarily rent or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/mortgage-rates/payment-structure/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mortgage payments</a>, can be no more than 28% of the monthly or annual <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/income.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">income</a>. Similarly, total debt payments cannot exceed 36% of income.\n", "\nSince the 28/36 rule is a standard that most lenders use before advancing any <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">credit</a>, consumers should be aware of the rule before they apply for any type of credit. That's because lenders pull credit checks for every application they receive. These <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hard-inquiry.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hard inquiries</a> show up on a consumer's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditreport.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">credit report</a>. Having multiple inquiries over a short period of time can affect a consumer's credit score and may hinder their chance of getting credit in the future.\n", "\nHere's a hypothetical example to show how the 28/36 rule actually works. Let's say an individual or family brings home a monthly income of $5,000. If they want to adhere to the 28/36 rule, they could budget $1,000 for a monthly mortgage payment and housing expenses. This would leave an additional $800 for making other types of loan <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/repayment.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">repayments</a>.\n"]}
