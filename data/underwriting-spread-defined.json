This will also be influenced by expectations for the demand of the securities in the market.\u00a0\n", "\nThe size of the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underwriting.asp\">underwriting</a> spread depends on the negotiations and competitive bidding among members of an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underwriter-syndicate.asp\">underwriter\u00a0syndicate</a>\u00a0and the issuing\u00a0company itself. The spread increases as the risks involved with the issuance increase.\n", "\nThe underwriting spread for an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ipo.asp\">initial public offering (IPO)</a> usually includes the following components:\n", "\nThe manager is\u00a0usually entitled to the whole underwriting spread. Each\u00a0member of the underwriting syndicate then gets a (not necessarily equal) share of the\u00a0underwriting fee and a portion of the concession. Additionally, a broker-dealer (BD), which is not itself a member of the underwriter\u00a0syndicate\u00a0earns a share of the\u00a0concession based on how well it does selling the issue.\n", "\nProportionately,\u00a0the\u00a0concession increases\u00a0as total underwriting fees rise. Meanwhile,\u00a0the management and underwriting fees decrease with gross underwriting fees.\u00a0The effect of size on the division of fees is usually due to\u00a0differential economies of scale. The extent of investment banker work, for example,\u00a0in writing the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/prospectus.asp\">prospectus</a> and preparing the roadshow\u00a0is somewhat fixed, while the amount of sales work is not. Larger deals will not involve exponentially more investment banker work.\n", "\nHowever, it might involve much more sales effort, requiring an increase in the proportion of the selling concession. Alternatively, junior banks may\u00a0join a syndicate, even if they receive a smaller share of the fees in the form of a lower selling concession.\n", "\nTo illustrate an underwriting spread, consider a company that\u00a0receives $36 per share from the underwriter for its shares. If the underwriters turn around and\u00a0sell the stock to the public at $38 per share, the underwriting spread\u00a0would be $2 per share. The value of the underwriting spread\u00a0can be influenced by variables such as the size of the issue, risk, and\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volatility.asp\">volatility</a>.\n"]}
