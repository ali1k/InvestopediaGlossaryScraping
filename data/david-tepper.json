David Tepper\u2019s worth is approximately $13 billion, according to\u00a0<em>Forbes </em>2020 The World\u2019s<em> </em>Billionaires List.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nDavid Tepper was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on September 11, 1957. He graduated from the University of Pittsburgh in 1978 with a degree in Economics. He earned his MBA in 1982 from what is now known as the<strong> </strong>David A. Tepper School of Business at Carnegie Mellon University. The business school was originally known as the Graduate School of Industrial Administration (GSIA). The school had its name changed in appreciation of the investing magnate after his generous gift of $55 million in 2003.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nDavid Tepper started his career as a credit and securities analyst with Equibank. He moved on to work for Republic Steel as a financial analyst. It was at this juncture that Tepper got firsthand experience of the credit structure of a distressed company when the steel company ran into financial troubles. His experience with money management came with his next job, at Keystone Mutual Funds, working on the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/high_yield_bond.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">high yield</a> desk.\n", "\nTepper began his career with Goldman Sachs in 1985\u00a0as a credit analyst. He soon progressed to the high-yield desk as a head trader where he worked mainly with <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/junkbond.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">junk bonds</a>. Tepper purchased distressed bonds of banks shaken by the junk bond market crash in 1989. Some of these banks survived their bankruptcy proceedings, making Goldman Sachs a lot of money through Tepper's skills. However, after failing to make partner at Goldman Sachs, Tepper left the firm to strike out on his own.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nIn 1993, David Tepper co-founded Appaloosa Management L.P. with a former Goldman Sachs colleague, Jack Walton. Appaloosa Management started with $57 million in capital.\u00a0In its first six months, Appaloosa delivered 57% returns on its assets and the fund grew to $300 million in 1994, $450 million in 1995, and $800 million in 1996. In 2014, its assets under management exceeded $20 billion. David Tepper <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/news/teppers-appaloosa-management-refunds-3b-clients/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">returned 20% of his investor capital</a> in 2016. By 2019, Appaloosa\u2019s assets under management were reportedly down to $14 billion with 70% of that total belonging to Tepper.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nAppaloosa mostly invests in debt of companies in distress. Its first investment was in a distressed steel company, Algoma Steel, which was in bankruptcy court. Tepper bought the steel company\u2019s preferred shares for $0.20 and sold them within a year for approximately $0.70. His fund lost 25% in the junk bond market crash 0f 2002 but soon recovered in subsequent years after successful bets were made on troubled and bankrupt companies like Enron, Worldcom, Marconi Corp., and Williams Co. The bonds he purchased in these companies contributed to a 150% gain in his portfolio position.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"6\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nTepper's aggressive style and confidence are often seen as his best traits as a hedge fund manager. In the mid-to late 90s, when certain emerging economies were on the verge of defaulting on their sovereign debts and investors were fleeing the other direction, Tepper took advantage of the negative situation by running an analysis of countries that were sure to recover. He bought debt in Argentina (Argentina Economic Crisis), South Korea (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asian-financial-crisis.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Asian Financial Crisis</a>), and Russia (Russian Financial Crisis), which earned him returns of 42%, 30% and -30%, respectively. Though he recorded a loss in his initial bet that the Russian government will not default, which turned out to be wrong, he kept buying the government bonds and eventually earned 60% on his bet.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"7\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nEarly in 2008, Tepper made a bet that blue-chip stocks would rise. The market went on a downward spiral soon after and Appaloosa lost 25%. Following the 2008 subprime mortgage crash, Tepper was bullish on bank stocks when most investors were fearful and wary of these institutions. He bought <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/preferredstock.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">preferred shares</a> in Washington Mutual and Wachovia which were both bought out by larger rivals earning Tepper a handsome profit.\n", "\nWhile panicked sellers were driving down the value of financial institutions like Bank of America and Citigroup, Tepper was investing in them. The hedge fund tycoon also purchased about $2 billion face value of commercial mortgage backed securities floated by AIG. When the government intervened in the survival of these banks, Appaloosa made over $7 billion in profits, 120% net-of-fees return, and a take-home pay of $4 billion.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"8\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff Tepper\u2019s trades following the 2008 market crash can arguably be labeled the greatest trades ever made.\n", "\nDavid Tepper is still active in the market, but he has expressed interest in converting to a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/family-offices.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">family office</a>. Appaloosa has repeatedly returned capital to its investors over the years and this trend has continued to the point where most of the money in the fund is personally connected to Tepper. Despite moving away from managing other people's money, Tepper is still a regular commentator on the market. Tepper's views can move the market in some instances when they are widely reported due to his track record as a hedge fund manager.\n"]}
