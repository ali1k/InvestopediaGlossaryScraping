This allows important patterns to more clearly stand out.\n", "\nData smoothing can be used to help predict trends, such as those found in securities prices, as well in economic analysis that can take into account the effects of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/seasonal-adjustment.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">seasonality</a> or which can ignore one-time outliers.\n", "\nWhen data is compiled, it can be manipulated to remove or reduce any <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volatility.asp\">volatility</a>, or any other type of noise. This is called data smoothing.\n", "\nThe idea behind data smoothing is that it can identify simplified changes in order to help predict different trends and patterns. It acts as an aid for statisticians or traders who need to look at a lot of data\u2014that can often be complicated to digest\u2014to find patterns they would not otherwise see.\n", "\nTo explain with a visual representation, imagine a one-year chart for Company X's stock. Each individual high point on the chart for the stock can be reduced while raising all the lower points. This would make a smoother curve, thus helping an investor make predictions about how the stock may perform in the future.\n", "\nThere are different methods in which data smoothing can be done. Some of these include the randomization method, using a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/random-walk-index.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">random walk</a>, calculating a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/movingaverage.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">moving average</a>, or conducting one of several exponential smoothing techniques.\n", "\nThe random walk model is commonly used to describe the behavior of financial instruments such as stocks. Some investors believe that there is no relationship between past movement in a security's price and its future movement. Random walk smoothing assumes that future data points will equal the last available data point plus a random variable. Technical and fundamental analysts disagree with this idea; they believe future movements can be extrapolated by examining past trends.\n", "\nOften used in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technicalanalysis.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">technical analysis</a>, the moving average smooths out price action while it filters out volatility from random price movements. This process is based on past prices, making it a trend-following\u2014or\u00a0lagging\u2014indicator. As can be seen in the price chart below, the moving average (EMA) has the general shape and trend of the underlying daily price data, depicted by the candlesticks. The more days incorporated into the moving average, the more smoothed the line becomes.\n", "\nData smoothing can be used to help identify trends in the economy, securities such as stocks, consumer sentiment, or for other business purposes.\n", "\nFor example, an economist can smooth out data to make <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/seasonal-adjustment.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">seasonal adjustments</a> for certain indicators like retail sales by reducing the variations that may occur each month like holidays or gas prices.\n", "\nThere are downfalls to using this tool, however. Data smoothing doesn't always provide an explanation of the trends or patterns it helps identify. It also may lead to certain data points being ignored by emphasizing others.\n", "\nAn often-cited example of data smoothing in business accounting is to make an \u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/allowancefordoubtfulaccounts.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">allowance for doubtful accounts</a>\u00a0to change\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bad-debt-expense.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bad debt expense</a>\u00a0from one reporting period to another. For example, a company expects not to receive payment for certain goods over two accounting periods; $1,000 in the first reporting period and $5,000 in the second reporting period.\n", "\nIf the first reporting period is expected to have a high income, the company may include the total amount of $6,000 as the allowance for doubtful accounts in that reporting period. This would increase the bad debt expense on the income statement by $6,000 and reduce net income by $6,000. This would thereby smooth out a high-income period by reducing income. It's important for companies to use judgment and legal accounting methods when adjusting any accounts.\n"]}
