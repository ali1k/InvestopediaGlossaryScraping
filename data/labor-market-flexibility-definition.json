It allows companies to make certain decisions about changing their labor force as a response to fluctuations in the market and to help boost production.\n", "\nOrganizations can make modifications to their labor pool based on certain factors such as employee hiring and firing, compensation and benefits, and working hours and conditions. Companies do not have carte blanche, however, to implement a flexible labor market because of laws and policies that protect employees and the labor pool.\n", "\nLabor market flexibility refers to how quickly a firm responds to changing conditions in the market by making modifications to its workforce. A flexible labor market allows employers to make changes because of supply and demand issues, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economic-cycle.asp\">the economic cycle</a>, and other market conditions.\n", "\nBut a truly flexible labor market only exists when there are few labor force regulations in place. When this is the case, employers are able to set wages, fire employees, and change their work hours at will. And the changes can go either way. For example, during tough economic times, an employer that has high flexibility can cut wages and increase the number of work hours that employees are expected to work to boost productivity. Conversely, when the economy is strong, the same employer may decide to give employees a slight raise and cut back on their hours.\n", "\nLess flexible labor markets are subject to more rules and regulations including <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/minimum_wage.asp\">minimum wages</a>, restrictions on firing, and other laws involving employment contracts. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/labor-union.asp\">Labor unions</a> often have considerable power in these markets.\n", "\nSome of the other factors that affect labor market flexibility include employee skills and training, occupational mobility, minimum wages, part-time and temporary work, and job-related information available to employees from the employer.\n", "\nSupporters of increased labor market flexibility argue that it leads to lower <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unemploymentrate.asp\">unemployment rates</a> and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/what-is-gdp/\">higher gross domestic product (GDP)</a> due to the unintended consequences of tight labor market restrictions. For example, a firm may consider hiring a full-time employee, but fear the employee will be extremely difficult to fire and may claim costly worker's compensation or sue based on alleged unfair treatment. The firm may choose to take on short-term contract workers instead.\n", "\nSuch a system benefits the relatively small number of full-time employees with especially secure positions, but hurts those on the outside\u2014those who must move between precarious, short-term gigs.\n", "\nProponents of tough labor market regulations, on the other hand, claim that flexibility puts all the power in the hands of the employer, resulting in an insecure workforce. The labor movement began in the 19th century in the U.S. and Europe as a response to dangerous and dirty workplace conditions, extremely long shifts, exploitative practices by management and owners\u2014wage garnishing, threats, and other abuse\u2014and arbitrary dismissals.\n", "\nEmployers had little incentive to ensure that workplace injuries and deaths were rare, since they faced no consequences for creating hazardous conditions, and employees who could no longer work were easy to replace.\n", "\nThis article addressed some of the factors that affect flexibility in the labor market above. We'll outline what a few of those factors mean for the labor market in this section.\n", "\nAlso called trade unions, these organizations represent the collective interests of a group of workers. Employees can band together through their union to initiate negotiations for better wages, working conditions, benefits, and working hours making the market less flexible.\n", "\nWhen employees are skilled and have ready access to training to improve on or increase their skills, they are better able to respond to changes in the market. For example, a customer service representative who goes back to school to get training in the information technology (IT) sector is able to respond to the growing demand for <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/042215/best-websites-find-job-tech-it.asp\">IT technicians</a> when vacancies arise.\n", "\nState and federal regulations limit how low employers can set the base pay per hour for employees. These minimums are based on changes in the cost of living and inflation. Some employers feel higher minimum wages cut into their productivity as well as their bottom line.\n", "\nPeople rely on the information provided by employers about the jobs available in the market. The more informed job seekers are about open positions, the easier it is for employees to respond to fluctuating conditions within a company's workforce and in the market, making it much more flexible.\n"]}
