The markup tells web browsers how to display a web page's words and images.\n", "\nEach individual piece markup code (which would fall between \"&lt;\" and \"&gt;\" characters) is referred to as an element, though many people also refer to it as a tag. Some elements come in pairs that indicate when some display effect is to begin and when it is to end.\n", "\nHyperText Markup Language is the computer language that facilitates website creation. The language, which has code words and syntax just like any other language, is relatively\u00a0easy to comprehend and, as time goes on, increasingly powerful\u00a0in what it allows someone to create. HTML continues to evolve to meet the demands and requirements of the Internet under the guise of the\u00a0World Wide Web Consortium,\u00a0the organization that designs and maintains the language; for instance, with the transition to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/web-20.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Web 2.0</a>.\n", "\nHyperText\u00a0is the method by which Internet users navigate the web. By clicking on special text called\u00a0hyperlinks, users are brought to new pages. The use of hyper means it is not linear, so users can go anywhere on the Internet simply by clicking on the available links. Markup\u00a0is what\u00a0HTML tags\u00a0do to the text inside of them; they mark it as a specific type of text. For example, markup text could come in the form of boldface or italicized type to draw specific attention to a word or phrase.\n", "\nAt its core, HTML is a series of short codes\u00a0typed into a text-file. These are the tags that power HTML\u2019s capabilities. The text is saved as an HTML file and\u00a0viewed through a web browser. The browser reads the file and translates the text into a visible form, as directed by the codes the author used to write what becomes the visible rendering. Writing HTML requires tags to be used correctly to create the author\u2019s vision.\n", "\nThe tags are what separate normal text from HTML code. Tags\u00a0are the words between what are known as angle-brackets, which allow graphics, images, and tables to appear on the webpage. Different tags perform different functions. The most basic tags apply formatting to text. As web interfaces need to become more dynamic, Cascading Style Sheets\u00a0(CSS) and JavaScript applications may be used. CSS\u00a0makes web pages more accessible and JavaScript adds power to basic HTML.\n", "\nUnlike\u00a0HTML,\u00a0Extensible Markup Language, or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/x/extensible-markup-language-xml.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">XML</a>, allows users to define their own markup. For instance, using XML, one user could choose to denote a footnote with the tag &lt;footnote&gt;, while another user could opt for &lt;fn&gt;.\n", "\nUsing HTML, only one pre-determined tag can be used to denote a specific type of information. XML documents are meant to be easy to read since they contain user-defined tags and since the documents only consist of markup and content.\n"]}
