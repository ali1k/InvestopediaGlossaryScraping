A value network allows members to buy and sell products as well as share information. These <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/network-effect.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">networks</a> can be visualized with a simple mapping tool showing nodes (members) and connectors (relationships).\n", "\nIn business and commerce, value networks are an example of an economic ecosystem. Each member relies on one another to foster growth and increase value. Value network members can consist of external members (e.g., customers) or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/043015/how-does-strong-value-chain-management-team-help-company.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">internal members</a>, such as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/randd.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">research and development</a> teams.\n", "\nValue networks enhance innovation, social welfare, and the environment, as well as many other areas. Weakness in one node can affect the entire network. For example, if a development team is weak, the production team has a harder time creating the product, which can leave a buyer waiting for their shipment.\n", "\nThe main types of value networks include the Clayton Christensen network, the Fjeldstad and Stabells network, Normann and Ramirez constellations, and Verna Allee's networks.\n", "\nThe Clayton Christensen network describes relationships that already exist externally and that any new entrants into the network will be molded to fit the current network or business model's shape. New entrants will have a difficult time to break through and/or provide new ideas or implement changes because the new entrants will most likely end up accommodating and falling in line with the current network.\n", "\nFjeldstad and Stabells believe that the most important parts of a network are (1) customers, (2) services, (3) service providers and, (4) contracts that allow access to services. This theory states that customers are essential to the network and their involvement provides the added value. The most common example is social media, e.g. Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok, where customers sign up, agree to terms in the contract, and add the value to the network.\n", "\nThe Normann and Ramirez constellations value network believes networks to be fluid setups that allow for constant change and improvement. It is up to members in the network to analyze the current relationships and look for openings and opportunities as a way to add value.\n", "\nVerna Allee's networks believe that networks create both tangible and intangible values and that <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/value-network-analysis.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">value network analysis</a> should be incorporated into all facets of a business to extract the most value in every stage.\n", "\nThe benefit that a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/103114/starbucks-example-value-chain-model.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">value network</a> provides comes from the way a business or individual applies the resources, influence, and insight of others to whom they are connected. A startup, for example, may look to its external connections, such as its investors and mentors, to provide experienced guidance on how to approach the development and growth of the business.\n", "\nWhile many founders have a deep understanding of the product or service they develop, bringing that service to market, finding customers, and scaling up the business may be unfamiliar to them.\n", "\nTo make up for this shortcoming, they may seek the advice of trusted <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stakeholder.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">stakeholders</a> with experience on such matters, which is considered an intangible benefit of their relationship. They might also look to groups that specialize in assisting <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/startup.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">startups</a>, such as incubators and accelerators, to increase their exposure to potential mentors and investors.\n", "\nAn <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/07/beat_the_mistakes.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">investor</a> typically provides their guidance to the startup they are backing because, by helping the leaders grow their ideas into a tangible company, stakeholders stand to benefit from the startup\u2019s development. That guidance can take the form of expertise that the investor possesses.\n", "\nThe investor might foster\u00a0introductions between\u00a0the founders of the startup and other businesses they can work with to further their plans. For example, if the company needs to produce a prototype of its product, an investor might be able to direct them to another company that creates made-to-order prototypes. Likewise,\u00a0if the startup is looking for a mass manufacturer or a distributor, the guidance they receive may benefit all involved as it can mean increased business for each organization and individual.\n"]}
