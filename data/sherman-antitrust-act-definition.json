The Act's purpose was to promote economic fairness and competitiveness and to regulate interstate commerce. The Sherman Antitrust Act was the first attempt by the United States Congress to address the use of trusts as a tool that enables a limited number of individuals to control certain key industries.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/antitrust.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Antitrust laws</a> refer broadly to the group of state and federal laws designed to ensure that businesses are competing fairly. Antitrust laws exist to promote competition among sellers, limit monopolies, and give consumers options.\n", "\nSupporters say that antitrust laws are necessary for an open marketplace to exist and thrive. Competition among sellers gives consumers lower prices, higher-quality products and services, more choice, and greater innovation. Opponents argue that allowing businesses to compete as they see fit would ultimately give consumers the best prices.\n", "\nThe Sherman Antitrust Act\u2014proposed in 1890 by Senator John Sherman from Ohio\u2014was the first measure passed by the U.S. Congress to prohibit trusts, monopolies, and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cartel.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cartels</a>. The Sherman Act also outlawed contracts, conspiracies, and other business practices that restrained trade and created monopolies within industries. For example, the Sherman Act says that competing individuals or businesses can't fix prices, divide markets, or attempt to rig bids. The Act also laid out specific penalties and fines for violating its rules.\n", "\nThe Sherman Antitrust Act was amended by the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/clayton-antitrust-act.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Clayton Antitrust Act</a> in 1914, which addressed specific practices that the Sherman Act did not ban. For example, the Clayton Act prohibits appointing the same person to make business decisions for competing companies.\n", "\nThe Sherman Antitrust Act was born against a backdrop of increasing monopolies and abuses of power by large corporations and railroad <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/conglomerate.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">conglomerates</a>. In 1887, in response to increasing public indignation about abuses of power and malpractices by railroad companies, Congress passed the Interstate Commerce Act, which spawned the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interstate-commerce-commission.asp#\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC)</a>\u2014whose purpose was to regulate interstate <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/100413/how-analyze-transportation-industry.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">transportation</a>\u00a0entities. In particular, the ICC had jurisdiction over U.S. railroads and all common carriers, requiring them to submit annual reports and prohibiting unfair practices such as discriminatory rates.\n", "\nHowever, during the first half of the 20th century, Congress consistently expanded the ICC's power such that, despite its intended purpose, some believed that the ICC was often guilty of assisting the very companies it was tasked to regulate\u2014by favoring <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/merger.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mergers</a> that created unfair monopolies, for example.\n", "\nCongress passed the Sherman Antitrust act at the height of what Mark Twain coined as the \"Gilded Age\" in American history. The Gilded Age, which occurred from the 1870s to about 1900 was a period dominated by political scandal and the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/robberbarons.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Robber Barons</a>,\u00a0the growth of railroads, the economization of oil and electricity, and the development of America's first giant\u2014national and international\u2014<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corporation.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">corporations</a>.\n", "\nThe\u00a0Gilded Age\u00a0was an era of rapid economic growth. Corporations took off during this time, in the part, because they were easy to register and, unlike today, had no <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incorporate.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">incorporation</a> fees.\n", "\nLate-19th-century legislators' understanding of \"trusts\" is different from our concept of the term. Today, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trust.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">trust</a> refers to a financial relationship in which one party gives another the right to hold property or assets for a third party. In the 19th century, however, a trust became an umbrella term for any sort of collusive or conspiratorial behavior that was seen to render competition unfair.<strong> </strong>The Sherman Antitrust Act was not designed to prevent <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monopolisticmarket.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">healthy monopolistic competition</a>, but to target those monopolies that resulted from a deliberate attempt to dominate the marketplace.\n", "\nThe Act was passed at a time of extreme public hostility toward large corporations like <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/08/jd-rockefeller.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Standard Oil</a> and the American Railway Union, which were seen to be unfairly monopolizing certain industries. This outcry sprang\u00a0from both consumers, who were being damaged by exorbitantly high prices on essential goods, and competitors in production, who found themselves shut out of industries because of deliberate attempts by certain companies to keep other enterprises out of the market.\n", "\nOn October 20, 2020, the U.S. Dept. of Justice filed an\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/antitrust.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">antitrust\u00a0</a>lawsuit against Google, alleging that the online giant engaged in anticompetitive conduct to preserve monopolies in search and search-advertising. The Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen compared the complaint to past uses of the Sherman Act to stop monopolistic practices by corporations. \u201cAs with its historic antitrust actions against AT&amp;T in 1974 and Microsoft in 1998, the Department is again enforcing the Sherman Act to restore the role of competition and open the door to the next wave of innovation\u2014this time in vital digital markets,\u201d\u00a0Rosen said in a press release<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff .\n", "\nHowever, popular demand for the Act signaled an important shift in American <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/regulated-market.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">regulatory </a>strategy toward business and markets. After the 19th-century rise of big business, American lawmakers reacted with a drive to regulate business practices more strictly. The Sherman Antitrust Act paved the way for more specific laws like the Clayton Act. Measures like these had widespread popular support, but lawmakers were also motivated by a genuine desire to keep the American market economy broadly competitive in the face of changing business practices.\n", "\nThe Sherman Antitrust Act is broken into three sections. Section 1 defines and bans specific means of anticompetitive conduct. Section 2 addresses the end results that are by their nature anti-competitive. As such, Sections 1 and 2 act to prevent the violation of the spirit of the law while still remaining within its bounds. Section 3 extends the guidelines and provisions in Section 1 to the District of Columbia and U.S. territories.\n"]}
