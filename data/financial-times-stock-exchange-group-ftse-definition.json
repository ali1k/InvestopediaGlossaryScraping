In addition to the FTSE Russell Group, the LSEG also owns the Borsa Italiana, Millennium IT, and other financial brands.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nThe indexing division of the FTSE is similar to that of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sp.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s</a>; it specializes in creating index offerings that the global financial markets can use as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/benchmark.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">benchmarks</a>. An index is comprised of a hypothetical portfolio of stock holdings, so it can act as a representation of the performance of a particular market segment\u2014also called a benchmark. Although the FTSE offers many indexes, its two most well-known indexes are the FTSE 100, which\u00a0is comprised of the most highly capitalized\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bluechipstock.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">blue-chip stocks</a>\u00a0listed on the London Stock Exchange, and the Russell 2000 Index, a small-cap stock market index of the smallest 2,000 stocks in the Russell 3000 Index.\n", "\nThe FTSE Russell Group, established in 2015 after the merger of FTSE and Russell Investments, is a U.K.-based global provider of benchmark financial indexes, market data, and analytics.\n", "\nThe FTSE's indexes are available across asset classes, styles, and strategies and are designed to meet the needs of a wide variety of clients, including buy-side, sell-side, custodians, asset owners, exchanges, investment consultants, and exchange traded fund (ETF) providers.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nThe FTSE 100 is very widely used\u00a0in Europe. At its creation, in January 1984, the index had a base level of 1,000. It has since reached highs of over 7,000.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff Many market analysts, traders, and investors look to the FTSE 100 as a proxy for the performance of the wider U.K. stock market, similar to the way that many U.S. investors look to the Dow Jones or the S&amp;P 500 indexes.\n", "\nThe level of the\u00a0FTSE\u00a0100 is calculated using the total market capitalization of the constituent companies and the index value. Total market capitalization changes alongside individual share prices of the indexed companies throughout the trading day, so the index value also changes. When the FTSE 100 is quoted up or down, it is measured against the previous day\u2019s market\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/close.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">close</a>. It is calculated continuously on every trading day from 8:00 AM at the market opening until the 4:30 p.m. LSE close. A FTSE 100 decline\u00a0means the value of the largest UK\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/listed.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">listed</a>\u00a0companies decreasing.

Any changes to the underlying index constituents and their weighting comes from the values of the companies taken at the close of business the night before the review.\n", "\nAs of January 2021, the top 5 FTSE 100 holdings by market cap were:<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nThe FTSE 100 is often considered a leading indicator of prosperity for the United Kingdom (UK) companies and the UK economy in general. As such it typically draws investors looking for exposure to big UK companies. While several of its listings do include companies with homes outside of the UK, it is most significantly made up of UK companies and impacted by UK daily developments.\n", "\nAs mentioned, there are a prolific number of indexes attached to the FTSE Group and the FTSE Russell brand. The\u00a0FTSE Group's most popular\u00a0index in addition to\u00a0the FTSE 100 is the\u00a0FTSE 250, the FTSE 350, and the FTSE All-Share. All four of these indexes have index fund offerings in the Vanguard FTSE 100 (VUKE), Vanguard FTSE 250 (VMID), the iShares 350 UK Equity Index Fund, and the Vanguard FTSE UK All Share Index Unit Trust.\n", "\nSome of the other popular FTSE Russell indices include:\n", "\nAs mentioned earlier, the FTSE 100 is a market-cap weighted index. Companies near the top of the market cap list often attract the most attention. As a historical example, consider the impact of British Petroleum (BP.L), one of the largest components by weight, on the index.
