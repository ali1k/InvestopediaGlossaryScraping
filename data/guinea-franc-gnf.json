Guinea was a French colony and gained its independence in 1958. Prior to this, the currency used in Guinea was the CFA Franc, which\u2014between 1945 and 1958\u2014was an abbreviation for the franc for \u201ccolonies fran\u00e7aises d'Afrique,\u201d or former French colonies in Africa.\n", "\nIn 1959, after Guinea\u2019s independence, the first Guinean franc was issued as the country\u2019s currency. It was then replaced by the Guinean syli, which was used in the country from 1971 to 1985. In 1985, the second Guinean franc replaced the syli at par.\n", "\nGuinea's economy is fueled by a rich reserve of minerals, gold, high-grade iron ore, and diamonds. Additionally, it boasts the world\u2019s largest reserves of bauxite, which is one of the main exports for the West African nation. However, the country, which has a GDP of $26.4 billion, has faced stalled economic growth because of political instability. Additionally, the Ebola virus slowed down Guinea\u2019s economic growth in 2014 and 2015. However, the country\u2019s economy grew at a rate of 6.7 percent in 2017.\n", "\nGuinea used to be part of the franc zone of former French colonies, using the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cfa-franc.asp\">CFA Franc</a> as its official currency until its independence. Many of its neighboring nations, 14 West African countries in total, 12 of which are former French colonies, still use the CFA franc. Together, they make up the African Financial Community.\n", "\nThe CFA was created in 1945, after World War II to keep from devaluing money in French colonies. Prior to this, currencies in the French colonies were pegged to the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/franc-f.asp\">French franc</a>, which was devalued with the signing of the Bretton Woods Agreement in 1945.\n", "\nWhen it was introduced in 1945, the exchange rate was 1 CFA to 1.70 French francs, shifting to 1 CFA to 2 French francs in 1948. The currency kept parity when France switched its currency from the French franc to the euro. The current fixed exchange rate for the CFA to the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/euro.asp\">euro</a> is 1 euro = 655.64 CFA franc.\n"]}
