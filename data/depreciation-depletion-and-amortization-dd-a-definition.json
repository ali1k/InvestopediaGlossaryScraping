In other words, it lets firms match expenses to the revenues they helped produce.\n", "\nFor example, if a large piece of machinery or property requires a large cash outlay, it can be expensed over its usable life, rather than in the individual period during which the cash outlay occurred.

A percentage of the purchase price is deducted over the course of the asset's useful life.\u00a0\n", "\nDepletion also lowers the cost value of an asset incrementally through scheduled charges to income. Where it differs is that it refers to the gradual exhaustion of natural resource reserves, as opposed to the wearing out of depreciable assets or the aging life of\u00a0intangibles.\n", "\nDepletion expense is commonly used by miners, loggers, oil and gas drillers, and other companies engaged in natural resource extraction. Enterprises with an economic interest in mineral property or standing timber may recognize depletion expenses against those assets as they are used. Depletion can be calculated on a cost or percentage basis, and businesses generally must use whichever provides the larger deduction for tax purposes.\n", "\nAmortization is very similar to depreciation, in theory, but applies to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intangibleasset.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">intangible assets</a> such as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/patent.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">patents</a><strong>, </strong>trademarks<strong>, </strong>and<strong> </strong>licenses, rather than physical property and equipment. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitallease.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Capital leases</a> are also amortized.\n", "\nIf a company uses all three of the above expensing methods, they will be recorded in its <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-statements.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">financial statement</a> as depreciation, depletion, and amortization (DD&amp;A).
