The accounting process includes summarizing, analyzing and reporting these transactions to oversight agencies, regulators and tax collection entities. The financial statements used in accounting are a concise summary of financial transactions over an accounting period, summarizing a company's operations, financial position and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashflow.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cash flows</a>.\u00a0\n", "\nAccounting is one of the key functions for almost any business. It may be handled by a bookkeeper or an accountant at a small firm, or by sizable finance departments with dozens of employees at larger companies. The reports generated by various streams of accounting, such as cost accounting and managerial accounting, are invaluable in helping management make informed business decisions.\u00a0\n", "\nThe financial statements that summarize a large company's operations, financial position and cash flows over a particular period are concise and consolidated reports based on thousands of individual financial transactions. As a result, all accounting designations are the culmination of years of study and rigorous examinations combined with a minimum number of years of practical accounting experience.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nWhile basic accounting functions can be handled by a bookkeeper, advanced accounting is typically handled by qualified accountants who possess designations such as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cpa.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Certified Public Accountant (CPA)</a> or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cma.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Certified Management Accountant (CMA)</a> in the United States.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"5\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff <span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff In Canada, the three legacy designations\u2014the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/ca.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chartered Accountant (CA)</a>, Certified General Accountant (CGA), and Certified Management Accountant (CMA)\u2014have been unified under the Chartered Professional Accountant (CPA) designation.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financialaccounting.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Financial accounting</a> refers to the processes used to generate interim and annual financial statements. The results of all financial transactions that occur during an accounting period are summarized into the balance sheet,\u00a0income statement\u00a0and\u00a0cash flow statement. The financial statements of most companies are audited annually by an external CPA firm.\u00a0For some, such as publicly traded companies, audits are a legal requirement.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"7\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff However, lenders also typically require the results of an external audit annually as part of their debt covenants. Therefore, most companies will have annual audits for one reason or another.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/managerialaccounting.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Managerial accounting</a> uses much of the same data as financial accounting, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/041015/how-does-financial-accounting-differ-managerial-accounting.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">but it organizes and utilizes information in different ways</a>. Namely, in managerial accounting, an accountant generates monthly or quarterly reports that a business's management team can use to make decisions about how the business operates. Managerial accounting also encompasses many other facets of accounting, including budgeting, forecasting and various financial analysis tools. Essentially, any information that may be useful to management falls underneath this umbrella.\n", "\nJust as managerial accounting helps businesses make decisions about management, cost accounting helps businesses make decisions about costing. Essentially, cost accounting considers all of the costs related to producing a product. Analysts, managers, business owners and accountants use this information to determine what their <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/060915/what-difference-between-transfer-price-and-standard-cost.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">products should cost</a>. In cost accounting, money is cast as an economic factor in production, whereas in financial accounting, money is considered to be a measure of a company's economic performance.\n", "\nIn most cases, accountants use <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gaap.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)</a> when preparing financial statements in the U.S. GAAP is a set of standards and principles designed to improve the comparability and consistency of financial reporting across industries. Its standards are based on double-entry accounting, a method in which every accounting transaction is entered as both a debit and credit in two separate general ledger accounts that will roll up into the balance sheet and income statement.\n", "\nTo illustrate double-entry accounting, imagine a business sends an invoice to one of its clients. An accountant using the double-entry method records a debit to accounts receivables, which flows through to the balance sheet, and a credit to sales revenue, which flows through to the income statement.\n", "\nWhen the client pays the invoice, the accountant credits accounts receivables and debits cash. Double-entry accounting is also called balancing the books, as all of the accounting entries are balanced against each other. If the entries aren't balanced, the accountant knows there must be a mistake somewhere in the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/generalledger.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">general ledger</a>.\n", "\nThe history of accounting has been around almost as long as money itself. Accounting history dates back to ancient civilizations in Mesopotamia, Egypt and Babylon. For example, during the Roman Empire the government had detailed records of their finances.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"10\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff However, modern accounting as a profession has only been around since the early 19th century.\n", "\nLuca Pacioli is considered \"The Father of Accounting and Bookkeeping\" due to his contributions to the development of accounting as a profession. An Italian mathematician and friend of Leonardo da Vinci, Pacioli published a book on the double-entry system of bookkeeping in 1494.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"8\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nBy 1880, the modern profession of accounting was fully formed and recognized by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"9\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff This institute created many of the systems by which accountants practice today. The formation of the institute occurred in large part due to the Industrial Revolution. Merchants not only needed to track their records but sought to avoid bankruptcy as well.\n", "\nAccounting is a profession whose core responsibility is to help businesses maintain accurate and timely records of their finances. Accountants are responsible for maintaining records of a company\u2019s daily transactions, and compiling those transactions into financial statements such as the balance sheet, income statement, and statement of cashflows. Accountants also provide other services, such as performing periodic audits or preparing ad-hoc management reports.\n", "\nAccountants hail from a wide variety of backgrounds. Generally speaking, however, attention to detail is a key component in accountancy, since accountants must be able to diagnose and correct subtle errors or discrepancies in a company\u2019s accounts. The ability to think logically is also essential, to help with problem-solving. Mathematical skills are helpful, but are less important than in previous generations due to the wide availability of computers and calculators.\n", "\nThe work performed by accountants is at the heart of modern financial markets. Without accounting, investors would be unable to rely on timely or accurate financial information, and companies\u2019 managements would lack the transparency needed to manage risks or plan projects. Regulators also rely on accountants for critical functions such as providing <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/auditors-opinion.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">auditors\u2019 opinions</a> on companies\u2019 <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/10-k.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">annual 10-K filings</a>. In short, although accounting is sometimes overlooked, it is absolutely critical for the smooth functioning of modern finance.\n"]}
