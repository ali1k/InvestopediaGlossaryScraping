In terms of race/ethnicity, 35% of Blacks and 23% of Latinx were underbanked vs. 11% of Whites.\n", "\nWhen it comes to applying for credit, the Federal Reserve survey showed that Americans with incomes under $40,000 per year were more likely to be denied traditional bank <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">credit</a> or approved for less than they had requested than those with incomes over $100,000 (37% vs. 10%, respectively). And in every income bracket, Black and Latinx individuals were more likely to experience an adverse credit outcome compared to Whites. White people were also more likely than Black and Latinx people to have at least one credit card. Having the option of borrowing on a credit card, the report notes, provides individuals with the wherewithal to deal with a financial disruption.\n", "\nThe 2017 FDIC study came to similar conclusions regarding links between the underbanked and lower income, lower education levels, less access to credit, and lower credit card usage.
