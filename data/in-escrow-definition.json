Typically, items are held in escrow until the process involving a financial transaction has been completed. Valuables held in escrow can include <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/realestate.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">real estate</a>, money, stocks, and securities.\n", "\nEscrowed items are most commonly found in real estate transactions. The property, cash, and the title to the property are often held in escrow until all specified conditions, outlined in the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/escrowagreement.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">escrow agreement</a>, are met, and transfer of ownership can occur.\n", "\nAn escrow agreement outlines the conditions and terms between the parties involved in the transaction as well as the responsibilities of each of the parties. Items placed in escrow are managed by a trustee called an escrow agent.

Real estate deals must clear a series of stages during the escrow process. Below are some of the typical conditions that might need to be met and why assets might be held in escrow.\n", "\nAn <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/appraisal.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">appraisal</a> of the property must be conducted on a property before its sale. Issues could arise if the appraised value of the property is lower than the agreed-upon purchase price.\n", "\nBanks will not lend money for the amount of a property if the asking price is above the appraised value. The buyer could try to find funding to cover the missing portion of the agreed purchase price for the property or ask the seller to lower the price. If the buyer can't fund the difference while the real estate is in escrow, the transaction could be terminated.\n", "\nA buyer might agree to purchase a property with the condition that the home passes a\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/home-inspection.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">home inspection</a>. The funds for the purchase would be held in escrow until the inspection has been completed. Once the conditions of the offer are satisfied, the buyer or seller will then be obligated to purchase or sell the property.\n", "\nThe real estate transaction could be held in escrow whereby the sale wouldn't be completed until the buyer obtains financing or a mortgage from a bank. Also, the buyer could have difficulty securing the necessary insurance and other policies needed to complete the transaction. If the buyer doesn't get approved for the mortgage or obtain the needed insurance, the escrow agent would nullify the offer to buy.\n", "\nBefore purchasing a home, a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/titlesearch.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">title search</a> is performed, which is a process of checking public records to determine the ownership of the property. The title search helps determine if there are any liens and other claims attached to the property. An outstanding <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lien.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lien</a> means that the property was used to guarantee the repayment of a loan.

This could include the removal of landscape features such as trees or the reconstruction of part of a building.
