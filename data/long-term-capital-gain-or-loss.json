Long-term capital gains are often given more favorable tax treatment than short-term gains.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nThe long-term capital gain or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalloss.asp\">loss</a> amount is determined by the difference in value between the sale price and the purchase price. This figure is either the net profit or loss that the investor experienced when selling the asset. Short-term capital gains or losses are determined by the net profit or loss an investor experienced when selling an asset that was owned for less than 12 months. The <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irs.asp\">Internal Revenue Service (IRS)</a> assigns a lower tax rate to long-term capital gains than short-term capital gains.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nA taxpayer will need to report the total of their capital gains earned for the year when they file their annual <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxreturn.asp\">tax returns</a>\u00a0because the IRS will treat these short-term capital gains earnings as taxable income. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate, which as of 2019 ranged from 0 to 20 percent, depending on the tax bracket that the taxpayer is in.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nWhen it comes to capital gains losses, both short-term and long-term losses are treated the same. Taxpayers can claim these losses against any long-term gains they may have experienced during the filing period.

Mellie first purchased these shares in 2005 during the initial offering period for $175,000 and is now selling them in 2019 for $220,000. She is experiencing a long-term capital gain of $45,000, which will then be subject to the capital gains tax.\n", "\nNow assume she is also selling her vacation home that she purchased in 2018 for $80,000. She has not owned the property for very long, so she has not gathered much equity in it. When she sells it only a few months later, she receives just $82,000. This presents her with a short-term capital gain of $2,000. Unlike the sale from her long-held shares of stock, this profit will be taxed as income, and it will add $2,000 onto her existing wage calculation.\n", "\nIf Mellie had instead sold her vacation home for $78,000, experiencing a short-term loss, she could have used that $2,000 to offset some of her tax liability for the $45,000 long-term capital gains she had experienced.\n"]}
