In addition, EOS nodes subscribe to a \"constitution\" that binds them, via the blockchain, to the rules and regulations set forth by the EOS community.\n", "\nCurrently administered by the block.one organization, EOS was launched by Dan Larimer, who is also the founder and creator of established platforms like Bitshares and Steem.\n", "\nAs of February 2020, EOS is among the 20 most valuable blockchain tokens by market capitalization.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nBlockchain-based dApps can be commercial or focused on individual users, and work in a way similar to\u00a0web-based apps. The EOS platform supports all required features for developing, hosting, and using the dApps, like providing secure access and authentication, permissioning, data hosting, usage management, and communication between the dApps and the Internet.\n", "\nNo official full form exists for EOS, and the creators have decided not to formally define it themselves. Compared to the web-based apps platform, the EOS offers a lot of advantages.\n", "\nLeveraging the scalability potential of blockchain, it is capable of processing large numbers of transactions in parallel. Its ownership structure eliminates transaction charges as users are permitted to utilize resources in proportion to their stake instead of the standard <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/transaction-fees.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pay-per-transaction</a> model.

To draw a parallel, EOS.IO is akin to the operating system of a computer\u2014it manages and controls the EOS blockchain network. EOS.IO uses blockchain architecture that is built to enable vertical and horizontal scaling of decentralized applications.

A token holder who is not running any apps can also allocate or rent his bandwidth to other participants who may need it.\n", "\nEOS achieves decentralized governance utilizing peer-to-peer terms of a binding contract among its participants, referred to as its \"constitution,\" theoretically similar in many ways to the governing documents established by nation-states.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff According to the EOS whitepaper:\n", "\nThe EOS techno-society is so ordered mutually through technological and social relations.\n"]}
