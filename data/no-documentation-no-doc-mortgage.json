This type of loan is instead approved on a declaration that confirms the borrower can afford the loan payments. No doc mortgages are commonly given to those whose incomes aren't easily verified. Largely unregulated, these loans are mainly based on the resale potential of the secured property and the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/repayment.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">repayment</a> structure of the mortgage.\n", "\nIn order to qualify for a mortgage, borrowers are normally required to submit proof of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/income.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">income</a>.
