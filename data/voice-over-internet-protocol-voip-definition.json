Voice-over-Internet Protocol converts the voice signal used in\u00a0traditional phone technology into a digital signal that travels through the Internet instead of through analog telephone lines.\n", "\nVoice-over-Internet-Protocol (VoIP) technology allows users to make \"telephone calls\" through Internet connections instead of through analog telephone lines, which renders these calls effectively free\u00a0wherever the Internet is available. VoIP changed the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/070815/what-telecommunications-sector.asp\">telecommunications industry</a> by making traditional phone lines and services nearly obsolete and reducing demand for them significantly.\n", "\nAs access to the Internet has become more widely available, VoIP has become ubiquitous both\u00a0for personal use and for business use.\u00a0\n", "\nVoIP works by converting voice audio into packets of data that then travel through the Internet like any other type of data such as text or pictures. These packets of sound data travel almost instantly through public and private Internet networks to route from the origination to the destination. Any landline or mobile phone that is\u00a0connected to the Internet can place and receive\u00a0VoIP calls. VoIP calls can also be conducted on computers through the computer microphone and speakers or headsets.\n", "\nBecause VoIP calls travel through the Internet instead of through analog telephone lines, they are subject to the same lags and delays as other data traveling the Internet\u00a0when <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bandwidth.asp\">bandwidth</a> is compromised or overwhelmed.\n", "\nThe pros of VoIP technology is that it reduces the cost of voice communication to almost nothing for personal and commercial use. Many Internet providers throw in VoIP telephone service for free for personal subscribers as an incentive to buy broadband or higher speed of Internet connection and Internet cable television channels. Since it costs the Internet provider a little extra to provide this service and it costs the customer nothing extra for this service, it is a win-win for everyone involved in the transaction.\n", "\nVoIP service has also enabled video calls, conference calls, and webinars for commercial and personal use at prices that are affordable or free. Previously, video conferencing and web conferencing were expensive and only available to companies large enough to justify the expense, but VoIP allows companies of all sizes, including solo practitioners and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/freelancer.asp\">freelancers</a>, to afford it.\n", "\nThe main con of VoIP services is that they can lag or clump. Because the sound goes in packets, it is slightly delayed. Under normal circumstances, untrained listeners won't be able to tell the difference between VoIP and analog calls. But when there is high bandwidth usage on the Internet, the packets may cluster or be delayed, which can cause a jerky, clumped sound on VoIP calls.\n", "\nSome VoIP services can't work during power outages if the user or provider does not have backup power. Some 9-1-1 services do not have the ability to recognize locations of VoIP calls.\n"]}
