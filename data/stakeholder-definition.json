The primary stakeholders in a typical corporation are its <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investor.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">investors</a>, employees, customers, and suppliers. However, with the increasing attention on <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corp-social-responsibility.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">corporate social responsibility</a>, the concept has been extended to include communities, governments, and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/chamber-of-commerce.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">trade associations.</a>\n", "\nStakeholders can be internal or external to an organization. Internal stakeholders are people whose interest in a company comes through a direct relationship, such as employment, ownership, or investment. External stakeholders are those who do not directly work with a company but are affected somehow by the actions and outcomes of the business. Suppliers, creditors, and public groups are all considered external stakeholders.\n", "\nInvestors are internal stakeholders who are significantly impacted by the associated concern and its performance. If, for example, a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/venturecapital.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">venture capital</a> firm decides to invest $5 million in a technology <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/startup.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">startup</a> in return for 10% equity and significant influence, the firm becomes an internal stakeholder of the startup. The return on the venture capitalist firm's investment hinges on the startup's success or failure, meaning that the firm has a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vestedinterest.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">vested interest</a>.\n", "\nExternal stakeholders, unlike internal stakeholders, do not have a direct relationship with the company. Instead, an external stakeholder is normally a person or organization affected by the operations of the business. When a company goes over the allowable limit of carbon emissions, for example, the town in which the company is located is considered an external stakeholder because it is affected by the increased pollution.\n", "\nConversely, external stakeholders may also sometimes have a direct effect on a company without a clear link to it. The government, for example, is an external stakeholder. When the government initiates policy changes on carbon emissions, the decision affects business operations of any entity with increased levels of carbon.\n", "\nA common problem that arises for companies with numerous stakeholders is that the various stakeholder interests may not align. In fact, the interests may be in direct conflict. For example, the primary goal of a corporation, from the perspective of its shareholders, is to maximize profits and enhance <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholder-value.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">shareholder value</a>. Since labor costs are unavoidable for most companies, a company may seek to keep these costs under tight control. This is likely to upset another group of stakeholders, its employees. The most efficient companies successfully manage the interests and expectations of all their stakeholders.\n", "\nStakeholders are bound to a company by some type of vested interest, usually for a longer term and for reasons of need. Meanwhile, a shareholder has a financial interest, but a shareholder can sell a stock and buy different stock or keep the proceeds in cash; they do not have a long-term need for the company and can get out at any time.\n", "\nFor example, if a company is performing poorly financially, the vendors in that company's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/supplychain.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">supply chain</a> might suffer if the company limits production and no longer uses their services. Similarly, employees of the company might lose their jobs. However, shareholders of the company can sell their stock and limit their losses.\n", "\nExamples of important stakeholders for a business include its shareholders, customers, suppliers, and employees. Some of these stakeholders, such as the shareholders and the employees, are internal to the business. Others, such as the business\u2019s customers and suppliers, are external to the business but are nevertheless affected by the business\u2019s actions. These days, it has become more common to talk about a broader range of external stakeholders, such as the government of the countries in which the business operates, or even the public at large.\n", "\nStakeholders are important for a number of reasons. For internal stakeholders, they are important because the business\u2019s operations rely on their ability to work together toward the business\u2019s goals. External stakeholders on the other hand can affect the business indirectly. For instance, customers can change their buying habits, suppliers can change their manufacturing and distribution practices, and governments can modify laws and regulations. Ultimately, managing relationships with internal and external stakeholders is key to a business\u2019s long-term success.\n", "\nAlthough shareholders are an important type of stakeholder, they are not the only stakeholders. Examples of other stakeholders include employees, customers, suppliers, governments, and the public at large. In recent years, there has been a trend toward thinking more broadly about who constitutes the stakeholders of a business.\n"]}
