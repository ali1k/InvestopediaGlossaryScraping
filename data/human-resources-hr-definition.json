HR plays a key role in helping companies deal with a fast-changing business environment and a greater demand for quality employees in the 21st century.\n", "\nJohn R. Commons, an American institutional economist, first coined the term \"human resource\" in his book \"The Distribution of Wealth,\" published in 1893. However, it was not until the\u00a019th\u00a0century that HR departments\u00a0were formerly developed and tasked with addressing misunderstandings between employees and their employers.\n", "\nThe presence of an HR department is an essential component of any business, regardless of the organization's size. An HR department is tasked with maximizing employee productivity and protecting the company from any issues that may arise within the workforce. HR responsibilities include compensation and benefits, recruitment, firing, and keeping up to date with any laws that may affect the company and its employees.\n", "\nResearch conducted by <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/conferenceboard.asp\">The Conference Board</a>, a member-driven economic think tank, has found six key people-related activities that HR must effectively\u00a0do to add value to a company. These include:\n", "\nBeginning in the 1980s, there was a push for strategic initiatives within HR departments. This movement was based on research related to the impact of employee-related issues on a firm's long-term business success. Collectively, these strategies are sometimes referred to as human resource management (HRM) strategies. HRM is a comprehensive approach to managing employees and an organization's culture and environment. It focuses on the recruitment, management, and general direction of the people who work in an organization.\n", "\nAn HR department that adopts HRM strategies typically plays a more active role in improving an organization\u2019s workforce. They may recommend processes, approaches, and business solutions to management. Google is one example of an organization that has adopted a more active approach to employee relations through their HR department. The company offers tons of employee perks, and the company headquarters have a wide range of facilities for employees, including wellness centers, roller hockey rinks, and horseshoe pits. For Google, happy employees are equivalent to productive employees.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nSince the start of the 20th century, some companies have started <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outsourcing.asp\">outsourcing</a> some of the more traditional administrative, transactional HR functions in an effort to free the department to recommend and implement more meaningful, value-adding programs that impact the business in positive ways. Functions that may be outsourced in this process include payroll administration, employee benefits, recruitment, background checks, exit interviews, risk management, dispute resolution, safety inspection, and office policies.\n"]}
