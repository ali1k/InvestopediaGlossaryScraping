He also paid $10,000 in income tax, retirement contributions, and Social Security payments. In this case, his gross earnings are $50,000, and his net earnings are $40,000.\n", "\nFor tax purposes, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) distinguishes gross earnings, also called gross income, and adjusted gross income (AGI). Gross income includes all of the money you have earned through the year including wages, income from a business, alimony payments from a former spouse, rental income, interest and a few other types of payments.\n", "\nThe IRS allows taxpayers to take a select number of above-the-line deductions from gross income, and these include certain expenses incurred by educators, eligible moving expenses, contributions to IRA accounts as well as a few others. The difference between your gross income and these deductions is your AGI. When completing your income tax return, you subtract a standard deduction or a list of itemized deductions from your AGI, and the difference yields your taxable income, the amount upon which the IRS levies an income tax.\n", "\nA company's gross earnings are reported periodically on its income statement. The first line of the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incomestatement.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">income statement</a> reports a company's total sales and revenues for a given time period, while the COGS and gross earnings often appear on the second and third lines of many income statements. The difference between revenue and COGS is a company's gross earnings. The COGS includes costs directly related to the company's product, such as materials for manufacturing, inventory for shops, and labor costs. Indirect costs are not included in the COGS.\n", "\nOnce a business has calculated its gross earnings, it may then subtract the rest of its business expenses, including costs such as utilities, loan repayments, office supplies, contractor fees, and many other expenses. The difference between the business's gross earnings and its operating and capital expenses is its profit.\n"]}
