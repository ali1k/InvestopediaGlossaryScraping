While <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insider.asp\">bank insiders</a> are not barred from taking out loans from a bank with which they are professionally associated, federal law carefully regulates how that bank treats the insider as a customer. In addition to setting restrictions on credit extensions for bank insiders, Regulation O requires that banks report any extensions provided to insiders in their <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/122214/what-quarterly-report.asp\">quarterly reports</a>.\u00a0\n", "\nRegulation O also gives a clear definition of bank insiders, dividing them into multiple tiers of association, subject to different credit extension regulations. Insiders can be directors or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trustee.asp\">trustees</a> of a bank, executive officers (for example, the president or treasurer) or principal shareholders (individuals who own or otherwise control more than 10% of the publicly-traded <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shares.asp\">shares</a> of the institution).\n", "\nGenerally speaking, the restrictions in place are devised to ensure that bank insiders are not given more advantageous or generous credit extensions than the bank would provide for a non-insider. The bank cannot give credit extensions that it would not provide to a non-insider customer, nor can it extend credit beyond legal or self-imposed lending limits. One exception to this rule comes with compensation packages provided by banks to all employees, including non-insiders. For example, if a bank has a policy of waiving certain <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortgage.asp\">mortgage</a> application fees for non-insider employees (such as tellers), the same fees could be waived for the bank president, who would be an insider.\n", "\nRegulation O lays out the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/disclosure.asp\">reporting requirements</a> included in two previous financial laws: the Financial Institutions Regulatory and Interest Rate Control Act of 1978 (the first iteration of Regulation O was fully rolled out by 1980)\u00a0and the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/depository-institutions-act-of-1982.asp\">Depository Institutions Act of 1982</a>.\u00a0\n", "\nBanks and other lending institutions are often able to find exceptions or workarounds to Regulation O, in effect, providing preferential treatment to insiders without violating any of the regulations. One of the provisions of the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dodd-frank-financial-regulatory-reform-bill.asp\">Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act</a> provided an extended\u00a0definition of \"credit extension\"\u00a0to expand the scope of\u00a0Regulation O.\n", "\nRecent growth in investments in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutualfund.asp\">mutual funds</a>, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp\">exchange-traded funds</a> (ETFs), and other index-based investment products has caused a number of companies to pay greater attention to Regulation O. Large asset management companies are becoming principal shareholders through \"fund complexes,\" organizations that invest in funds. A complex that acquires 10% of a class of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/votingshares.asp\">voting </a>securities of a banking organization is considered a \u201cprincipal shareholder.\u201d\n"]}
