Government bonds can pay periodic interest payments called coupon payments. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/where-can-i-buy-government-bonds/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Government bonds</a> issued by national governments are often considered low-risk investments since the issuing government backs them.\n", "\nGovernment bonds may also be known as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sovereign-debt.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sovereign debt.</a>\n", "\nGovernment bonds are issued by governments to raise money to finance projects or day-to-day operations.

Some <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurybond.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Treasury bonds</a> trade in the secondary market. Individual investors, working with a financial institution or broker, can buy and sell previously issued bonds through this marketplace. Treasuries are widely available for purchase through the U.S. Treasury, brokers, as well as exchange-traded funds, which contain a basket of securities.\n", "\nFixed-rate government bonds can have\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestraterisk.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">interest rate risk</a>, which occurs when interest rates are rising, and investors are holding lower paying fixed-rate bonds as compared to the market. Also, only select bonds keep up with <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">inflation</a>, which is a measure of price increases throughout the economy.

These are known as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/municipalbond.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">municipal bonds</a>, and often carry certain tax advantages for investors.\n", "\nU.S. Treasuries are nearly as close to risk-free as an investment can get. This low-risk profile is because the issuing government backs the bonds. Government bonds from the U.S. Treasury are some of the most secure worldwide, while those floated by other countries may carry a greater degree of risk.\n", "\nDue to this nearly risk-free nature, market participants and analysts use Treasuries as a benchmark in comparing the risk associated with securities. The 10-year Treasury bond is also used as a benchmark and guide for interest rates on lending products. Due to their low risk, U.S. Treasuries tend to offer lower\u00a0rates of return relative to equities and corporate bonds.\n", "\nHowever, government-backed bonds, particularly those in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/emergingmarketeconomy.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">emerging markets</a>, can carry risks that include country risk, political risk, and central-bank risk, including whether the banking system is solvent.

During this crisis, several Asian nations were forced to devalue their currency which sent reverberations around the globe. The crisis even caused Russia to default on its debt.\n", "\nGovernment bonds assist in funding deficits in the federal budget and are used to raise capital for various projects such as infrastructure spending. However, government bonds are also used by the Federal Reserve Bank to control the nation's money supply.\n", "\nWhen the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalreservebank.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Federal Reserve</a> repurchases U.S. government bonds, the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/moneysupply.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">money supply</a> increases throughout the economy as sellers receive funds to spend or invest in the market. Any funds deposited into banks are, in turn, used by those financial institutions to loan to companies and individuals, further boosting economic activity.\n", "\nAs with all investments, government bonds provide both benefits and disadvantages to the bondholder. On the upside, these debt securities tend to return a steady stream of interest income. However, this return is usually lower than other products on the market due to the reduced level of risk involved in their investments.\u00a0\n", "\nThe market for U.S. government bonds is very liquid, allowing the holder to resell them on the secondary bond market easily. There are even ETFs and mutual funds that focus their investment on Treasury bonds.\n", "\nFixed rate bonds may fall behind during periods of increasing inflation or rising market interest rates. Also, foreign bonds are exposed to sovereign or governmental risk, changes in currency rates, and have a higher risk of default.\u00a0\n", "\nSome U.S. Treasury bonds are free of state and federal taxes. But, the investor of foreign bonds may face taxes on income from these foreign investments.\n", "\nThere are various types of bonds offered by the U.S. Treasury that have various maturities.
