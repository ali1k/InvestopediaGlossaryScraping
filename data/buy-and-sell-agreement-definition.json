Most often, the buy and sell agreement stipulates that the available share be sold to the remaining partners or to the partnership.\n", "\nThe buy and sell agreement is also known as\u00a0a buy-sell agreement, a buyout agreement, a business will, or a business prenup.\n", "\nBuy and sell agreements are commonly used by sole proprietorships, partnerships, and closed corporations in an attempt to smooth transitions in ownership when each partner dies, retires, or decides to exit the business.\n", "\nThe buy and sell agreement requires that the business share be sold to the company or the remaining members of the business according to a predetermined formula.\n", "\nIn the case of the death of a partner, the estate must agree to sell.\n", "\nThere are two common forms of agreements:\n", "\nSome partners opt for a mix of the two, with some portions available for purchase by individual partners and the remainder bought by the partnership.\n", "\nIn order to ensure that funds are available, partners in business commonly purchase life insurance policies on the other partners. In the event of a death, the proceeds from the policy will be used towards the purchase of the deceased's business interest.\n", "\nWhen a sole proprietor dies, a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/key-employee.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">key employee</a>\u00a0may be\u00a0designated as the buyer or successor.\n", "\nBuy and sell agreements are designed to help partners manage potentially difficult situations in ways that protect the business and their own personal and family interests.\n", "\nFor example, the agreement can restrict owners from selling their interests to outside investors without approval from the remaining owners. Similar protection can be provided in the event of a partner's death.\n", "\nA typical agreement might stipulate that a deceased partner's interest be sold back to the business or remaining owners. This prevents the estate from selling the interest to an outsider.\n", "\nIn addition to controlling ownership of the business, buy and sell agreements spell out the means to be used in assessing the value of a partner's share. This can have uses outside the question of buying and selling shares. For example, if there is a dispute among owners about the value of the company or of a partner's interest, the valuation methods included in the buy and sell agreement would be used.\n"]}
