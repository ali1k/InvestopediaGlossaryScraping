Mom-and-pop stores are often operations that struggle to compete with more substantial establishments, such as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/big_box_retailer.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">big-box retailers</a>, who generally boast more buying power than smaller players. In the last few years, \"shop local\" and \"shop small\" have been used as slogans in marketing campaigns. The term \"mom-and-pop\" also refers to inexperienced investors who casually play the market.\n", "\nMom-and-pop stores were historically used to describe local family owned and operated general stores or drugstores. Today, mom-and-pop establishments are synonymous with various different types of businesses, including restaurants, bookstores, automotive repair shops, and insurance agencies.\n", "\nIn many ways, mom-and-pop businesses stand at a steep disadvantage to large corporations, e-commerce companies, technology platforms, and franchise businesses, who enjoy bigger\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economiesofscale.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">economies of scale</a>, greater access to capital for investments, larger advertising budgets, higher brand awareness, greater access to talent pools for hiring, etc.\n", "\nThis collectively gives larger players a competitive edge over mom-and-pop businesses, <em>who frequently, lose ground and find themselves forced out of business in response.</em>\n", "\nFortunately, there are signs of hope for mom-and-pop stores. More than ever before, consumers are demanding more personalized products and services. When shoppers ask, \"Where can I find a mom-and-pop shop near me?\" they don't need to look further than the Internet. Using technology, like social media, small businesses can expand their\u00a0target audience and broaden their geographical reach.\n", "\nMom-and-pop shops also benefit from a phenomenon known as \"Small Business Saturday,\" which is a recent American tradition of shopping locally on the Saturday following Thanksgiving. This shopping holiday is a logical answer to Black Friday, where large retailers offer enticing discounts to consumers. Mom-and-pop business owners tend to have a vested interest in the community, its citizens, and the local economy.\u00a0Consequently, they offer highly interactive and personalized services that large corporations cannot replicate.\u00a0For this reason, mom-and-pop stores often win increased <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brand-loyalty.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">brand loyalty</a> among consumers.\n", "\n\"Mom-and-pop\" also refers to inexperienced investors who minimally invest in the stock market. Despite limited capital commitments, mom-and-pop investors often count on significant returns on their trades, in order to supplement their income.\n", "\nBut many mom-and-pop investors are unfamiliar with market research\u00a0and react impulsively to market changes and fluctuations, by rashly dumping their positions, rather than riding out rough patches.\n", "\nSome mom-and-pop investors combat their inexperience by hiring brokers to facilitate trades, or by using one of the many online trading\u00a0platforms to facilitate their investments.\n"]}
