EPLI insures against claims from employees that employers have violated their rights. Eligible claims for such lawsuits can range from any form of discrimination to wrongful termination.\n", "\nThe most common award from these types of lawsuits is punitive\u00a0or monetary\u00a0damages. These are usually issued\u00a0to cover a range of needs, including <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/medical-expenses.asp\">medical costs</a>, loss of income, and pain and suffering.\n", "\nEmployers carry EPLI policies to cover the costs they could incur if legal action is pursued. If an employee feels that <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/workers-compensation.asp\">workers' compensation</a> does not adequately cover their loss\u2014perhaps because they feel their employer\u2019s negligence caused their injury\u2014they may decide to sue their employer for\u00a0punitive damages such as\u00a0pain and suffering.\n", "\nEPLI addresses this risk and is designed to cover expenses not protected by workers' compensation or general <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liability_insurance.asp\">liability\u00a0insurance</a>: a mainly mandatory form of insurance that provides some level of coverage for\u00a0medical expenses\u00a0and lost wages for employees or their beneficiaries when injured, falling sick, or killed as a result of their job.\n", "\nThere are other instances of the term wrap-around insurance being used that do not include employee versus employer interactions.

Defendants in criminal cases, on the other hand, can request an attorney at a cost to the state if they cannot reasonably afford one.\n", "\nFurthermore, with a civil case, there is no threat of jail time or a criminal conviction. There\u2019s usually no jury, either\u2014most civil cases are tried and decided solely in front of a judge.\n"]}
