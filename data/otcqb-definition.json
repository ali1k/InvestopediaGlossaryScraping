It was created in 2010 and consists mainly of early-stage and developing U.S. and international companies that are not yet able to qualify for the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otcqx.asp\">OTCQX</a> but are not as speculative as the lowest-tier <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pinksheets.asp\">Pink Sheets</a>.\n", "\nThe OTCQB replaced the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)-operated <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otcbb.asp\">OTC Bulletin Board</a> (OTCBB) as the main market for trading OTC securities that report to a U.S. regulator. As it has no minimum financial standards, the OTCQB often includes shell companies, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pennystock.asp\">penny stocks</a>, and small foreign issuers.\n", "\nThe over-the-counter or OTC market is a decentralized market where securities not listed on major exchanges are traded directly by a network of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dealer.asp\">dealers</a>.
