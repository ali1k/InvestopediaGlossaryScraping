Once the term expires, the policyholder can either renew it for another term, convert the policy to permanent coverage, or allow the term life insurance policy to terminate.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\"></span>\n", "\nWhen you <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/best-term-life-insurance-4845961\">buy a term life insurance policy</a>, the insurance company determines the premiums based on the value of the policy (the payout amount) as well as your age, gender, and health. In some cases, a medical exam may be required. The insurance company may also inquire about your driving record, current medications, smoking status, occupation, hobbies, and family history.\n", "\nIf you die during the term of the policy, the insurer will pay the face value of the policy to your beneficiaries. This cash benefit\u2014which is, in most cases, not taxable\u2014may be used by beneficiaries to settle your healthcare and funeral costs, consumer debt, or mortgage debt among other things. However, if the policy expires before your death, there is no payout. You may be able to renew a term policy at its expiration, but the premiums will be recalculated for your age at the time of renewal. Term life policies have no value other than the guaranteed death benefit. There is no savings component as found in a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wholelife.asp\">whole life insurance</a> product.\n", "\nBecause it offers a benefit for a restricted time and provides only a death benefit, term life is usually the least costly life insurance available. A healthy 35-year-old non-smoker can typically obtain a 20-year\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/levelpremiumlife.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">level-premium policy</a>\u00a0with a $250,000 face value for $20 to $30 per month. Purchasing a whole life equivalent would have significantly higher premiums, possibly $200 to $300 per month. Because most term life insurance policies expire before paying a death benefit, the overall risk to the insurer is lower than that of a permanent life policy.\u00a0The reduced risk allows insurers to pass cost savings to the customers in the form of lowering premiums.\n", "\nInterest rates, the financials of the insurance company, and state regulations can also affect premiums. In general, companies often offer better rates at \"breakpoint\" coverage levels of $100,000, $250,000, $500,000, and $1,000,000.\n", "\nThirty-year-old\u00a0George wants to protect his family in the unlikely event of his early death. He buys a $500,000 10-year term life insurance policy with a premium of $50 per month. If George dies within the 10-year term, the policy will pay George\u2019s beneficiary $500,000. If he dies after he turns 40, when the policy has expired, his beneficiary will receive no benefit. If he renews the policy, the premiums will be higher than with his initial policy because they will be based on his age of 40 instead of 30.\n", "\nIf George is diagnosed with a terminal illness during the first policy term, he likely will not be eligible to renew once that policy expires. Some policies do offer guaranteed re-insurability (without proof of insurability), but such features, when available, tend to make the policy cost more.\n", "\nThere are several different types of term life insurance; the best option will depend on your individual circumstances.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nThese provide coverage for a specified period ranging from 10 to 30 years. Both the death benefit and premium are fixed.\u00a0Because actuaries must account for the increasing costs of insurance over the life of the policy's effectiveness, the premium is comparatively higher than yearly renewable term life insurance.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/y/yearly-renewable-term-yrt.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Yearly renewable term (YRT)</a> policies have no specified term, but can be renewed each year without providing evidence of insurability. The premiums change from year to year; as the insured person ages, the premiums increase. Although there is no specified term, premiums can become prohibitively expensive as individuals age, making the policy an unattractive choice for many.\n", "\nThese policies have\u00a0a death benefit that declines each year, according to a predetermined schedule. The policyholder pays a fixed, level premium for the duration of the policy. Decreasing term policies are often used in concert with a mortgage to match the coverage with the declining principal of the home loan.\n", "\nOnce you've picked the policy that's right for you, remember to research the firms you're considering thoroughly to ensure you'll get the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/best-term-life-insurance-4845961\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">best term life insurance</a> available.\n", "\nTerm life insurance is attractive to young people with children.\u00a0Parents may obtain large amounts of coverage for reasonably low costs. Upon the death of a parent, the significant benefit can replace lost income.\n", "\nThese policies are also well-suited for people who temporarily need specific amounts of life insurance. For example, the policyholder may calculate that by the time the policy expires, their survivors will no longer need extra financial protection or will have accumulated enough liquid assets to self-insure.\u00a0\n", "\nThe main <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/205.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">differences between a term life insurance policy and a permanent insurance policy, such as universal life insurance</a>, are the duration of the policy, the accumulation of a cash value, and the cost.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff The right choice for you will depend on your needs; here are some things to consider.\n", "\nTerm life policies are ideal for people who want substantial coverage at low costs. Whole life customers pay more in premiums for less coverage but have the security of knowing they are protected for life.\u00a0\u00a0\n", "\nWhile many buyers favor the affordability of term life, paying premiums for an extended period and having no benefit after the term's expiration is an unattractive feature. Upon renewal, term life insurance premiums increase with age and may become cost-prohibitive over time. In fact, renewal term life premiums may be more expensive than permanent life insurance premiums would have been at the issue of the original term life policy.\u00a0\n", "\nUnless a term policy has <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/guaranteed_renewable_policy.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">guaranteed renewable policy,</a> the company could refuse to renew coverage at the end of a policy's term if the policyholder developed a serious illness. Permanent insurance provides coverage for life, as long as premiums are paid.\n", "\nSome customers prefer permanent life insurance because the policies can have an investment or savings vehicle. A portion of each premium payment is allocated to the cash value, which may have a\u00a0growth\u00a0guarantee. Some plans pay dividends, which can be paid out or kept on deposit within the policy. Over time, the cash value growth may be sufficient to pay the premiums on the policy. There are also several unique tax benefits, such as tax-deferred cash value growth and tax-free access to the cash portion.\n", "\nFinancial advisors warn that the growth rate of a policy with cash value is often paltry compared to other financial instruments, such as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutualfund.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mutual funds</a> and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">exchange-traded funds (ETFs)</a>. Also, substantial administrative fees often cut into the rate of return. Hence, the common phrase \"buy term and invest the difference.\" However, the performance is steady and tax-advantaged, a benefit in time when the stock market is volatile.\n", "\nApparently, there is no one-size-fits-all answer to the term versus permanent insurance debate. Other factors to consider include:\u00a0\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/convertible-insurance.asp\">Convertible term life insurance</a>\u00a0is a term life policy that includes a conversion rider.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\"></span> The rider guarantees the right to convert an in-force term policy\u2014or one about to expire\u2014to a permanent plan without going through underwriting or proving insurability.\u00a0The conversion rider should allow you to convert to any permanent policy the insurance company offers with no restrictions.\n", "\nThe primary features of the rider are\u00a0maintaining\u00a0the original health rating of the term policy upon conversion, even if you later have health issues or become uninsurable,\u00a0and deciding when and how much of the coverage to convert. The basis for the premium of the new permanent policy is your age at conversion.\u00a0\n", "\nOf course, overall premiums will increase significantly, since whole life insurance is more expensive than term life insurance. The advantage is the guaranteed approval without a medical exam. Medical conditions that develop\u00a0during the term life period cannot adjust premiums upward. However, if you want to add additional riders to the new policy, such as a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/ltcinsurance.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">long-term care</a> rider, the company may require limited or full underwriting.\n", "\nAmong insurance policies, term life insurance guarantees payment of a stated death benefit if the policyholder dies within the stated term period. Term periods may last anywhere from a year to 30 years. Importantly, term life insurance policies do not possess monetary or savings value unless the holder dies within the term. However, term life insurance may be less costly than other life insurance options, such as whole life insurance.\u00a0\n", "\nTerm life insurance occurs over a predetermined period of time, typically between 10 and 30 years. Term policies may be renewed after they end, with premiums recalculated according to the holder\u2019s age, life expectancy, and health. By contrast, whole life insurance covers the entire life of the holder. Unlike a term life policy, whole life insurance includes a savings component, where the cash value of the contract accumulates for the holder. Here, the holder can withdraw or borrow against the savings portion of their policy, where it can serve as a source of equity.\n", "\nThe holder will not have their money returned once a term life insurance policy expires if they outlive the policy. Meanwhile, whole life insurance premiums may cost ten times more by comparison. This is because the risk to the insurer is much lower with term life policies. For instance, a term life insurance policy may follow the given structure, where a healthy 45 year old holder pays fixed monthly premiums of $60 for 20 years, with a $500,000 death benefit payout.\n"]}
