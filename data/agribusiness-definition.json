This industry is an important component of the economy in countries with arable land since agricultural products can be <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/export.asp\">exported</a>.\n", "\nAgribusiness treats the different aspects of raising agricultural products as an integrated system. Farmers raise animals and harvest fruits and vegetables with the help of sophisticated harvesting techniques, including the use of GPS to direct operations. Manufacturers develop increasingly efficient machines that can drive themselves. Processing plants determine the best way to clean and package livestock for shipping. While each subset of the industry is unlikely to interact directly with the consumer, each is focused on operating <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/efficiency.asp\">efficiently</a> in order to keep prices reasonable.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/market-economy/\">Market forces</a> have a significant impact on the agribusiness sector, as do natural forces, such as changes in the earth's climate.\n", "\nCountries with farming industries face consistent pressures from global competition. Products such as wheat, corn,\u00a0and soybeans tend to be similar in different locations, making them <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commodity.asp\">commodities</a>. Remaining competitive requires agribusinesses to operate more efficiently, which can require investments in new technologies, new ways of fertilizing and watering crops,\u00a0and new ways of connecting to the global market.\n", "\nGlobal prices of agricultural products may change rapidly, making production planning a complicated activity. Farmers may also face a reduction in usable land as suburban and urban areas expand into their regions.\n", "\nThe use of new technology is vital to remain competitive in the global agribusiness sector. Farmers need to reduce crop costs and increase yield per square acre to remain competitive.\n", "\nNew drone technology is at the cutting edge of the industry. An article published in 2016 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) identified\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/601935/six-ways-drones-are-revolutionizing-agriculture/\"><em>Six Ways Drones Are Revolutionizing Agriculture</em></a>. These techniques, including soil and field analysis, planting, and crop monitoring, will be key to improving crop yields and moving the agribusiness sector forward.\n", "\nKey areas of concern for the use of drone technology remain\u00a0the safety of drone operations, privacy issues,\u00a0and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurance.asp\">insurance</a>-coverage questions.\n", "\nBecause agribusiness is a broad industry, it incorporates a wide range of different companies and operations. Agribusinesses include small family farms and food producers up to multinational <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/conglomerate.asp\">conglomerates</a> involved in the production of food on a national scale.\n", "\nSome examples of agribusinesses include farm machinery producers such as Deere &amp; Company, seed and agrichemical manufacturers such as Monsanto, food processing companies such as Archer Daniels Midland Company, as well as farmer's cooperatives, agritourism companies, and makers of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/biofuel.asp\">biofuels</a>, animal feeds, and other related products.\n"]}
