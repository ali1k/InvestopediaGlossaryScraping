In simple words, the DLT is all about the idea of a \"decentralized\"\u00a0network against the conventional \"centralized\"\u00a0mechanism, and it is deemed to have far-reaching implications on sectors and entities that have long relied upon a trusted third-party.\n", "\nDistributed Ledger Technology\u00a0(DLT) is a protocol that enables the secure functioning of a decentralized digital database. Distributed networks eliminate the need for a central authority to keep a check against manipulation.\n", "\nDLT allows for storage of all information in a secure and accurate manner using cryptography. The same can be accessed using \"keys\" and cryptographic signatures. Once the information is stored, it becomes an immutable database and is governed by the rules of the network.\n", "\nThe idea of a distributed ledger is not totally new, and many organizations do maintain data at different locations. However, each location is typically on a connected central system, which updates each one of them periodically. This makes the central database vulnerable to cyber-crime and prone to delays since a central body has to update each distantly located note.\n", "\nThe very nature of a decentralized ledger makes them immune to a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0112/3-ways-cyber-crime-impacts-business.aspx\">cyber-crime</a>, as all the copies stored across the network need to be attacked at the same time for the attack to be successful. Additionally, the simultaneous (peer-to-peer) sharing and updating of records make the whole process much faster, more effective, and cheaper.\n", "\nDLT has great potential to revolutionize the way governments, institutions, and corporations\u00a0work. It can help governments with tax collection, the issuance of passports, recording land registries and licenses, and the outlay of Social Security benefits as well as voting procedures. The technology is making waves in industries such as finance, music and entertainment, diamond and other precious assets, art, supply chains of various commodities, and more.\n", "\nIn addition to startups, many big companies such as IBM and Microsoft are experimenting with the blockchain\u00a0technology. Some of the most popular distributed ledger protocols are Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, R3 Corda, and Quorum.\n"]}
