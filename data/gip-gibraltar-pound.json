The Gibraltar pound is pegged at <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/parvalue.asp\">par value</a> with the British pound sterling. The government of Gibraltar issues the GIP, and mints coins in\u00a0\u00a31, \u00a32, \u00a35, 1 pence, 2 pence, 5 pence, 10 pence, 20 pence\u00a0and 50 pence, and it prints banknotes in\u00a0\u00a35, \u00a310, \u00a320, \u00a350, and \u00a3100.\u00a0\n", "\nGibraltar is represented in the European Union as a British overseas territory. The GIP is not recognized in the United Kingdom\u00a0although it can be exchanged for British pound sterling notes. The Gibraltar pound is tied to the\u00a0Sterling pound\u00a0with a fixed exchange rate.\u00a0\n", "\nGibraltar is a British territory located in\u00a0the south of the Iberian Peninsula. The Gibraltar pound is\u00a0issued by the Government of Gibraltar under the terms of the 1934 Act Currency Notes. The\u00a0notes are legal tender in Gibraltar as are British coins and notes issued by\u00a0the Bank of England. The coins in circulation use British names\u00a0but have different designs. Most retail stores in Gibraltar unofficially also accept the euro although the Royal Gibraltar Post Office does not accept the euro.\n", "\nThe British military has\u00a0dominated the economy of Gibraltar, and its naval dockyard was historically\u00a0the center of economic activity. However, military activities are less prominent and have declined over the last twenty years. According to Oanda, a trading platform, military activities now account for an estimated <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www1.oanda.com/currency/iso-currency-codes/GIP\" rel=\"nofollow\">7%</a> of the local economy. In 1984, military activities represented\u00a0over 60 percent of the economy. Gibraltar's economy is now based on\u00a0financial services, online gaming, navigation and tourism.\n", "\nUntil 1825, the Spanish real, or the Spanish \u201creal de plata,\u201d\u00a0was the official currency of Gibraltar. From 1825 to 1872, the real continued to circulate alongside the British and Spanish currencies. The real was tied to the pound at the rate of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www1.oanda.com/currency/iso-currency-codes/GIP\" rel=\"nofollow\">1 Spanish dollar to 4 shillings 4 pence</a> (equivalent to 21.67 pence today, according to Oanda. In 1872, the real became the only\u00a0legal tender. However, in 1898, the value of the Spanish peseta plummeted because of the Spanish-American War, and\u00a0the Gibraltar Pound became\u00a0the legal tender\u00a0initially in the form of British coins and banknotes. Gibraltar pound coins with different designs were introduced in 1988,\u00a02-pound coins were introduced in 1999\u00a0and a new 5-pound coin was issued in 2010 inscribed with \"Elizabeth II \u2022 Queen of Gibraltar.\"\n"]}
