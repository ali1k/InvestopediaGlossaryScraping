The ratio compares a firm's book value to its market value. A company's book value is calculated by looking at the company's historical cost, or accounting value. A firm's market value is determined by its share price in the stock market and the number of shares it has outstanding, which is its <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">market capitalization</a>.\n", "\nThe book-to-market ratio compares a company's book value to its market value. The book value is the value of assets minus the value of the liabilities. The market value of a company is the market price of one of its shares multiplied by the number of shares outstanding.

If the book value is higher than the market value, analysts consider the company to be undervalued. The book-to-market ratio is used to compare a company\u2019s net asset value or book value to its current or market value.\n", "\nThe book value of a firm is its historical cost or accounting value calculated from the company\u2019s balance sheet. Book value can be calculated by subtracting total liabilities, preferred shares, and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intangibleasset.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">intangible assets</a> from the total assets of a company. In effect, the book value represents how much a company would have left in assets if it went out of business today.

The market value is the price that investors are willing to pay to acquire or sell the stock in the secondary markets. Since it is determined by supply and demand in the market, it does not always represent the actual value of a firm.\n", "\nThe book-to-market ratio identifies undervalued or overvalued <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">securities </a>by taking the book value and dividing it by the market value.

If it is less than 1, the stock is considered overvalued. A ratio above 1 indicates that the stock price of a company is trading for less than the worth of its assets.

Like the book-to-market ratio, it seeks to evaluate whether a company's stock is over or undervalued by comparing the market price of all outstanding shares with the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetvaluation.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">net assets</a> of the company.\n", "\nA market-to-book ratio above 1 means that the company\u2019s stock is overvalued.
