We do not include selling, administrative and other expenses since these are mostly fixed costs. We then subtract the cost of goods sold from revenues to obtain a gross profit of $151,800 - $126,584 = $25,216 million.\n", "\nTo obtain the gross profit margin, we divide the gross profit by total revenues for a margin of $25,216 / $151,800 = 16.61%. This compares favorably to an automotive industry average of around 14%, suggesting that Ford operates more efficiently than its peers.\n", "\nStandardized income statements prepared by financial data services may give slightly different gross profits. These statements conveniently display gross profits as a separate line item, but they are only available for public companies.\n", "\nInvestors reviewing private companies' income should familiarize themselves with the cost and expense items on a non-standardized balance sheet that do and don't factor into gross profit calculations.\n", "\nGross profit, also known as gross income or pre-tax earnings, equals a company\u2019s revenues minus its cost of goods sold. It is typically used to evaluate how efficiently a company is managing labor and supplies in production. Generally speaking, gross profit will consider variable costs, which fluctuate in relation to production output. These costs may include labor, shipping, and materials, among others.\n", "\nWhile gross profit refers to subtracting the variable costs, or cost of goods sold from its sales, net income further subtracts interest costs and taxes from company earnings. Net income is sometimes referred to as the \u201cbottom line\u201d since it falls on the last line of a company\u2019s income sheet. It is often used to measure the profitability of a company.\n", "\nConsider the following quarterly income statement where a company has $100,000 in revenues and $75,000 in cost of goods sold. Importantly, under expenses, your calculation would not include the $10,000 fixed costs which fall under selling, administrative, and other expenses. To arrive at the gross profit total, the $100,000 in revenues would subtract $75,000 in cost of goods sold to equal $25,000.\n"]}
