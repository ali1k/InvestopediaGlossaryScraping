That analysis can be human generated using <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technicalindicator.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">technical indicators</a>,\u00a0or it can be generated using mathematical <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/algorithm.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">algorithms</a> based on market action, possibly in combination with other market factors such as economic indicators.\n", "\nTrade signals can use a variety of inputs from several disciplines. Typically, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technicalanalysis.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">technical analysis</a> is a major component, but fundamental analysis, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quantitativeanalysis.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">quantitative analysis</a>, and economics may also be inputs, as well as sentiment measures and even signals from other trade signal systems. The goal is to give investors and traders a mechanical method, devoid of emotion, to buy or sell a security or other asset.\n", "\nAside from simple buy and sell triggers, trade signals can also be used to modify a portfolio by determining when it might be a good time to buy more of one particular sector, such as technology, and lighten up on another, such as consumer staples. Bond traders, meanwhile, could have signals for adjusting the duration of their portfolios by selling one <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maturity.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">maturity</a> and buying a different maturity.\u00a0Finally, it can also help with <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetclasses.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">asset class</a> allocation, such as shifting money among stocks, bonds, and gold.\n", "\nThere is no limit to how complex a trade signal can be. However, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trader.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">traders</a> tend to keep things simple by using only a handful of inputs. For practical purposes, it is far easier to manage a simple signal generator and periodically test it to see what components need adjusting or replacing.\n", "\nToo many inputs would introduce complexity requiring more time than a trader has to offer. And since markets change over time, often with great speed, complex strategies could be rendered obsolete before testing is even finished.\n", "\nTrade signals tend to be associated with quick in and out trading. However, in reality, some signals are less frequent and based on reversion and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/buy-the-dips.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">dip-buying</a> in equities.\n", "\nGreat trading signals of this sort would be to look for periods where price action doesn't line up with the underlying <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundamentals.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fundamentals</a>. An example would be if the market is selling off due to fear headlines, but the fundamental data indicates good <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-health.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">health</a>. Traders may decide to buy the dip if their signal is flashing \"good deal.\"\n", "\nThere are endless possibilities when coming up with\u00a0a trade signal, but traders tend to just want to automate their thinking. An example might be, \"for a stock with lower than a certain <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-earningsratio.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">price-to-earnings ratio</a> (P/E ratio), buy when a certain technical formation breaks out to the upside, and prices are above a certain moving average\u00a0while\u00a0interest rates are falling.\"\n", "\nHere are several of the more common inputs. Traders can combine them as they wish to meet whatever criteria they use to select trades.\n"]}
