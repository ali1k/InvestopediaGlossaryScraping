In other words, it is the likelihood that if something survives to one moment, it will also survive to the next.\n", "\nThe hazard rate only applies to items that\u00a0cannot be repaired and is sometimes referred to as the failure rate.

R(t), on the other hand, is the survival function, or the probability that something will survive past a certain time (t).\n", "\nThe probability density calculates the probability of failure at any given time. For instance, a person has a certainty of dying eventually. As you get older, you have a greater chance of dying at a specific age, since the average failure rate is calculated as a fraction of the number of units that exist in a specific interval, divided by the number of total units at the beginning of the interval.\n", "\nIf we were to calculate a person's chances of dying at a certain age, we would divide one year by the number of years that person potentially has left to live. This number would grow larger each year. A person aged 60 would have a higher probability of dying at age 65 than a\u00a0person aged 30 because the person aged 30 still has many more units of time (years) left in his or her life, and the probability that the person\u00a0will die during one specific unit of time is lower.\n", "\nIn many instances, the hazard rate can resemble the shape of a bathtub. The curve slopes downwards at the beginning, indicating a decreasing hazard rate, then levels out to be constant, before moving upwards as the item in question ages.\n", "\nThink of it this way: when an auto manufacturer puts together a car, its components are not expected to fail in its first few years of service. However, as the car ages, the probability of malfunction increases.
