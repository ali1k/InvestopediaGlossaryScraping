The explosion of electronic financial transactions created a need for new rules that would give consumers the same level of confidence as they have in the checking system. This includes the ability to challenge errors, correct them within a 60-day window, and limit\u00a0liability\u00a0on a lost card to $50 if it is reported as lost within two business days.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nIf the institution is notified within three to 59 days of a lost card, the liability could be as much as $500.
