It is calculated by taking price changes for each item in the predetermined <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/basket_of_goods.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">basket of goods</a> and averaging them.

Essentially it attempts to quantify the aggregate price level in an economy and thus measure the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/purchasingpower.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">purchasing power</a> of a country's unit of currency. The weighted average of the prices of goods and services that approximates an individual's consumption patterns is used to calculate CPI.

It is based upon the index average for the period from 1982 through 1984 (inclusive) which was set to 100. So a CPI reading of 100 means that inflation is back to the level that it was in 1984 while readings of 175 and 225 would indicate a rise in the inflation level of 75% and 125% respectively. The quoted inflation rate is actually the change in the index from the prior period, whether it is monthly, quarterly or yearly.\n", "\nWhile it does measure the variation in price for retail goods and other items paid by consumers, it does not include things like savings and investments, and can often exclude spending by foreign visitors.\u00a0\n", "\nCPI is an economic indicator. It is the most widely used measure of inflation and, by proxy,\u00a0of the effectiveness of the government\u2019s economic policy.

Generally, the dollar\u2019s purchasing power declines when the aggregate price level increases and vice versa.\u00a0\n", "\nThe index can also be used to adjust people\u2019s eligibility levels for certain types of government assistance including Social Security and it automatically provides the cost-of-living wage adjustments to domestic workers.

It is one of the most commonly cited economic statistics, and is widely used as a proxy for inflation. Investors pay close attention to CPI as an indicator of where the economy is headed, influencing price forecasts for inflation-sensitive assets such as bonds and commodities. Among the general public, CPI is often seen as a barometer of overall economic health, with most commentators preferring low to moderate CPI in the 2-3% range.\n", "\nCPI is the weighted-average price of a broad cross-section of goods and services. This collection of items, often referred to as the CPI\u2019s \u201cbasket\u201d of goods, is intended to mimic the typical products and services purchased by American consumers. Over the years, as the prices of those products rise due to inflation, this gradual increase is reflected in a rising CPI. In the media, CPI is commonly referred to in terms of its percentage year-over-year change.\n", "\nSome have argued that the CPI fails to capture the regional variations in prices, as well as the different buying patterns of particular groups of Americans. For example, Americans living in expensive areas such as New York City or San Francisco may have significantly different spending patterns as compared to those living in rural or suburban areas. Another common criticism of CPI is that it understates the rate of inflation by failing to adequately reflect certain types of expenditures. For instance, the CPI includes out-of-pocket medical expenses but does not fully reflect the portion of medical expenses borne by insurance companies and government healthcare programs.\n"]}
