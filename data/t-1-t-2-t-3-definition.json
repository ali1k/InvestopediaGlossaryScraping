The T stands for <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/transaction.asp\">transaction</a> date, which is the day the transaction takes place. The numbers 1, 2 or 3 denote how many days after the transaction date the settlement or the transfer of money and security ownership takes place.\n", "\nFor determining the T+1 (T+2, T+3)\u00a0settlement date, the\u00a0only days\u00a0counted are those on which the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockmarket.asp\">stock market</a> is open. T+1 means that if a transaction occurs on a Monday, settlement must occur by Tuesday. Likewise, T+3 means that a transaction occurring on a Monday must be settled by Thursday, assuming no holidays occur between these days. But if you sell a security with a T+3 settlement date on a Friday, ownership and money transfer does not have to take place until the following Wednesday.\n", "\nThe period between transaction and settlement is not\u00a0flex time in which an investor\u00a0can back out of a\u00a0deal. The deal is done on the transaction day \u2013\u00a0it's only\u00a0the transfer that does not take place until later.\n", "\nIn the past, security transactions were done manually rather than electronically. Investors would have to wait for the delivery of a particular security, which was an actual certificate,\u00a0and they\u00a0would not pay until receipt. Since delivery times could vary and prices could fluctuate, market regulators set a period of time in which securities and cash must be delivered.\n", "\nSome years ago, the settlement date for stocks was T+5, or five <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/business-day.asp\">business days</a> after the transaction date. Until recently, settlement was set at T+3.\u00a0Today, it's T+2\u00a0(i.e.,\u00a0two business days after the transaction date).\n", "\nSettlement dates vary, according to the type of security.\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurybill.asp\">Treasury bills</a>, for instance,\u00a0are about the only security that can be transacted and settled on the same day.\u00a0All stocks and most mutual funds are currently T+2; however, bonds and some money market funds will vary between T+1, T+2 and T+3.\n", "\nAs an example of how T+1 (T+2, T+3) settlement dates work, consider\u00a0an investor who buys shares of Microsoft (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=msft\">MSFT</a>) on Monday, April 9, 2018.\u00a0While the\u00a0broker would debit the investor's\u00a0account for the total cost of the investment immediately after the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fill.asp\">order is filled</a>, the investor's\u00a0status as a shareholder of Microsoft will not be settled in the company's record books until Wednesday, April\u00a011. The settlement date is the date on\u00a0which the investor\u00a0become a\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/holderofrecord.asp\">shareholder of record</a>.
