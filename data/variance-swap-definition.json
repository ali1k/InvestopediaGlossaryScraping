These assets include exchange rates, interest rates, or the price of an index.\u00a0In plain language, the variance is the difference between an expected result and the actual result.\n", "\nA variance swap is quite similar to a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volatilityswap.asp\">volatility swap</a>, which utilizes realized volatility instead of variance.\n", "\nSimilar to a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/plain-vanilla-swap.asp\">plain vanilla swap</a>, one of the two parties involved in a var swap transaction will pay an amount based upon the actual variance of price changes of the underlying asset. The other party will pay a fixed amount, called the strike, specified at the start of the contract. The strike is typically set at the onset to make the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/npv.asp\">net present value</a>\u00a0(NPV) of the payoff zero.\n", "\nAt the end of the contract, the net payoff to the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/counterparty.asp\">counterparties</a> will be a theoretical amount multiplied by the difference between the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/variance.asp\">variance</a> and a fixed amount of volatility, settled in cash. Due to any margin requirements specified in the contract, some payments may occur during the life of the contract should the contract's value move beyond agreed limits.\n", "\nThe variance swap, in mathematical terms, is the arithmetic average of the squared differences from the mean value. The square root of the variance is the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standarddeviation.asp\">standard deviation</a>. Because of this, a variance swap's\u00a0payout will be larger than that of a volatility swap, as the basis of these\u00a0products is at variance rather than the standard deviation.\n", "\nA variance swap is a pure-play on an underlying asset's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volatility.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">volatility</a>. Options also give an investor the possibility to\u00a0speculate on an asset's volatility. But, options carry directional risk, and their prices depend on many factors, including time, expiration, and implied volatility. Therefore, the equivalent <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">options</a> strategy requires additional risk hedging to complete. Variance swaps are also cheaper to put on since an options equivalent involves a strip of options.\n", "\nThere are three main classes of users for variance swaps.\n", "\nVariance swaps are well suited for <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/speculation.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">speculation</a> or hedging on volatility.
