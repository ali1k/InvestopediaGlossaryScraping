Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a programming language commonly used by data-exchange services (like blog feeds) to send information between otherwise incompatible systems. It is readable by both humans and computers and is based\u00a0on SGML (standard generalized markup language), an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/international-organization-for-standardization-iso.asp\">international standard</a> for electronic documents. Many other languages, such as RSS and XHTML, are based on XML.\n", "\nUnlike <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/html.asp\">HTML</a>, XML allows users to define their own markup. Using XML, one user could choose to denote a footnote with the tag &lt;footnote&gt;, while another user could opt for &lt;fn&gt;. Using HTML, only one pre-determined tag can be used to denote a specific type of information. XML documents are meant to be easy to read since they contain user-defined tags and since the documents only consist of markup and content. Markup is the text that appears between two pointed brackets (e.g., &lt;footnote&gt;), and content is everything else.\n"]}
