In addition,\u00a0most asset classes also quote the bid and ask price that determines the final sale price. The\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bid.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bid</a> is defined as the highest price a buyer is willing to pay for the assets, while the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/ask.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ask</a> is the highest price a seller is willing to receive for selling.\n", "\nIt's common for stable, liquid assets to record narrow <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bid-askspread.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bid-ask spreads</a> in a normal trading environment. However, the pair will usually divert following\u00a0systemic concerns like geopolitical events or broad market downturns. The onset of volatility and uncertainty moves the supply and demand mechanisms undermining quotations into flux.\u00a0\n", "\nQuotations represent two pieces of information for most asset classes: the price an investor would need to pay to purchase an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">asset</a> at a particular moment in time (the lowest price \"asked\" by sellers) and the price an investor would receive for the same asset if they sold it at the same time (the highest \"bid\" by potential buyers). Together, the difference between the two represents the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">liquidity</a> cost an investor incurs when trading an asset\u00a0since they must buy at the bid price and sell at the asking price.\n", "\nQuotations aren't confined just\u00a0to bid and ask prices. They also include high, low, open, and close values for a given day. A basic <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockquote.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">stock quote</a>\u00a0highlights these key data points to provide context around the current day's movements.\u00a0The spread between the open and close or high and low is often a reflection of\u00a0the ongoing trend. For example, sharp changes between the open and close signals strong upward momentum and an interesting trading opportunity.\u00a0\n", "\nMost investors won't\u00a0hesitate to connect the term quotation\u00a0with stock prices, but many other\u00a0asset classes\u00a0record quotes of the last price traded.\n", "\nFor instance, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixedincome.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fixed income markets</a> also quote the bid\u00a0and ask prices of a bond during regular trading hours. In addition to bid-ask spreads, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bondquote.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bond quotes</a> showcase the asset's par value and yield to maturity.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/parvalue.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Par value</a> is often converted to a numeric value and multiplied by 10 to determine a bond's cost.\u00a0\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futurescontract.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Futures contracts</a> and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commodity.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">commodities</a> also use quotes to provide investors and the finance audience relevant information about the asset.\n"]}
