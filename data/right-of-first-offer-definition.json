If the right holder is no longer interested in the property, the seller can then sell it to a third party. Rights of first offer are most commonly used in the real estate industry and the sale of businesses.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nA right of first offer is usually written into a contract such as a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lease.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lease</a> agreement or business partnership. It is triggered when the owner wants to sell the asset or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/real-property.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">real property</a>. Under the terms of the contract, the owner is obliged to give the holder of the right of first offer the first chance to buy the property. The right holder has a specific amount of time in which to make an offer before it the right expires. The seller is free to accept or reject the offer.\n", "\nIf\u00a0the seller rejects the offer,\u00a0the owner can then sell it to a third party without any restrictions. If\u00a0the attempts at selling to a third party are unsuccessful, the seller can come back to the right holder for a new offer. At this point the right holder is not bound by their original offer and therefore can lower it. Knowing the seller has been unsuccessful in finding a third party buyer puts the right holder\u00a0in a stronger position. Sellers typically include landlords and business owners, while right holders are generally tenants and investors.\n", "\nThe most common situation where a right of first offer is used is in real estate between a landlord and tenant. The tenant may want a right of first offer from the landlord to avoid being forced to relocate in the event of a sale of the property. The tenant <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/090815/buying-your-first-investment-property-top-10-tips.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">may wish to make a reasonable offer on the property</a>. Meanwhile, the landlord may consider the offer to make a quick sale and minimize legal and brokerage fees.\n", "\nThe right of first offer is also used <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/08/sell-small-business.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">when a business is being sold off</a>. A business owner may give the right of first offer to partners or investors before putting it on the general market to sell to a third party.\n", "\nA right of first offer is closely related to a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rightoffirstrefusal.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">right of first refusal</a>, but the former is considered to favor the seller while the latter is considered to favor the prospective buyer. A right of first refusal gives the holder of the right the option to match an offer that has been received by someone wishing to sell an asset.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff Assets with a right of first refusal attached can be more difficult to sell, because potential buyers may not want to go to the trouble of negotiating a deal that must be offered to another party first.\n"]}
