Money market fund shares are always assigned a nominal <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nav.asp\">net asset value</a> (NAV) of $1, even though the actual NAV is usually slightly more or less than $1.\n", "\nSuch funds are required by law to disclose the actual NAV\u2014the shadow share price\u2014to show the fund's performance to investors more accurately. However, the use of the term \"shadow price\" in relation to money market funds is the less common usage. It is more frequently applied in the process of cost-benefit analysis in business decision making.\n", "\nIn its most common usage, a shadow price is an \"artificial\" price assigned to a non-priced asset or accounting entry. Shadow pricing is frequently guided by certain assumptions about costs or value. It is generally a subjective and inexact, or imprecise, endeavor. To make a decision regarding the undertaking of a project or investment, businesses often perform a comparative analysis of the project or investment cost against the projected benefits.\n", "\nIn performing a cost-benefit analysis, a business must often account for the costs or benefits of intangible assets that are difficult to assign a dollar value to but that must nonetheless be monetarily quantified for the purpose of performing the analysis.\n", "\nAn example of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/050614/introduction-dark-pools.asp\">shadow pricing</a> as applied to a proposed business plan to renovate a company's office facilities might be the assignment of a dollar value to the expected benefits of doing the renovation. While the cost of the renovation can\u00a0easily be assigned a dollar value, there are elements of the project's expected benefit that must be assigned a shadow price because they are not as easy to quantify.\n", "\nThe possible benefits of the project include the following:\n", "\nSince it is impossible to assign a precise dollar value to such potential benefits, an estimated shadow price is assigned to set a dollar figure to compare with the cost figure.\n"]}
