It was created by Congress in 1934 as the first federal regulator of the securities markets. The SEC promotes full public disclosure, protects <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investor.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">investors</a> against fraudulent and manipulative practices in the market, and monitors corporate takeover actions in the United States.

Through established securities rules and regulations, the SEC promotes disclosure and sharing of market-related information, fair dealing, and protection against fraud. It provides investors with access to registration statements, periodic financial reports, and other securities forms through its electronic data-gathering, analysis, and retrieval database, known as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/edgar.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">EDGAR.</a><span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nThe SEC is headed by five commissioners who are appointed by the president, one of whom is designated as chairman.

Because many had previously provided false or misleading information, public faith in the integrity of the securities markets plunged. To restore confidence, Congress passed the Securities Act of 1933 and the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/seact1934.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Securities Exchange Act of 1934</a>, which created the SEC.

In total, it charged 204 entities or individuals and collected close to $4 billion in penalties, disgorgement, and other monetary relief. Goldman Sachs, for example, paid $550 million, the largest penalty ever for a Wall Street firm and the second-largest in SEC history, exceeded only by the $750 million paid by <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/worldcom.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">WorldCom</a>.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"6\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff <span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"8\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nStill, many observers have criticized the SEC for not doing enough to help prosecute the brokers and senior managers who were involved in the crisis, almost all of whom were never found guilty of significant wrongdoing. So far, only one Wall Street executive has been\u00a0jailed for crimes related to the crisis. The rest either settled for a monetary penalty or accepted administrative punishments.\n"]}
