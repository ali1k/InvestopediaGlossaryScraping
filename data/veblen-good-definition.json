A Veblen good\u00a0has an upward-sloping <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/demand-curve.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">demand curve</a>, which runs counter to the typical downward-sloping curve. However, a Veblen good is generally a high-quality, coveted product, in contrast to a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/giffen-good.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Giffen good</a>, which is an inferior product that does not have easily available substitutes.\n", "\nThe increase in demand for a Veblen good reflects consumer tastes and preferences, unlike a Giffen good, a Veblen good is where higher <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/demand.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">demand</a> is directly attributable to the price increase. The term is named after the American economist <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/thorstein-veblen.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Thorstein Veblen</a>, who is best known for introducing the term \u201cconspicuous consumption.\u201d\n", "\nVeblen goods are fairly commonplace, unlike Giffen goods which are elusive and quite difficult to identify. Very expensive products, such as designer jewelry, pricey watches, yachts, and luxury cars that are marketed as being \u201cexclusive,\u201d or which convey the appearance of success, can be classified as Veblen goods.\n", "\nVeblen goods are generally targeted at affluent individuals, have a very strong <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brand-identity.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">brand identity</a> that is synonymous with luxury, and are far more likely to be sold in upscale <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/boutique.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">boutiques</a> than in common department stores. For all intents and purposes, a Veblen good is a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/luxury-item.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">luxury item</a> that a majority of the population will not or cannot purchase.\n", "\nVeblen goods contradict the basic <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lawofdemand.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">law of demand</a>, which states that <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quantitydemanded.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">quantity demanded</a> has an inverse relationship with price, because of their exclusivity appeal. If the price of a coveted and expensive product is increased, it may actually enhance its appeal to the status-conscious, since it is now further out of reach for the average consumer.\n", "\nBut if the price of such a product is lowered, its exclusive appeal may diminish resulting in it being shunned by status-conscious consumers, while at the same time still being too expensive for the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mass-market-retailer.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mass market</a>. Overall demand would therefore decline with lower prices, instead of increasing.\n", "\nWhile there is no specific price point that can be identified as the dividing line between a Veblen good and a normal product, it may be safe to assume that a Veblen good is generally priced exponentially higher than a basic product in the same category. Take the case of watches. Good-quality watches are widely available for less than $100, but to qualify as a Veblen good, a watch would probably carry a four, five, or six-digit price tag.\n", "\nStudies indicate that people are happier and receive more <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/utility.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">utility</a> with the purchase of a Veblen good. This is a result of the good making the individual feel more exclusive and important, with the knowledge that they are purchasing something of high quality that is out of reach for others. Many individuals believe this is worth the premium they pay.\n", "\nSometimes, when a good is priced high, an individual will automatically assume it to be of better quality, when in fact it is not necessarily so. Many companies source or produce their goods in the same regions or factories, but because of marketing and brand identity, some are sold at a premium.\n", "\nConsumers automatically associate the higher price with better quality. If the price is increased on the same good, consumers may then perceive this as improved quality and are willing to pay the higher price.\n", "\nSimilarly, when a good is perceived as difficult to purchase, an affluent consumer is willing to pay more for it. This is commonly seen in the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/08/fine-art.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">art world</a>. Paintings from deceased artists, such as Picasso or Monet, fetch millions of dollars, due to the fact that a limited quantity exists. The price does not necessarily reflect the quality of the art but the fact that the artist's paintings are not readily available in society.\n"]}
