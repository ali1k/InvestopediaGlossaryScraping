This inventory has not been sold or used for a long period of time\u00a0and is not expected to be sold in the future. This type of inventory has to be written-down or written-off and can cause large losses for a company.\n", "\nObsolete inventory is also referred to as dead inventory or excess inventory.\n", "\nInventory refers to the goods and materials in a company\u2019s possession that are ready to be sold. It is one of the most important assets of a\u00a0business\u00a0operation, as it accounts for a huge percentage of a sales company\u2019s revenues.\n", "\nIn the past, if the inventory was held for too long, the goods may have reached the end of their product life and become obsolete. Currently, with technology, the state of abundance, and customers' high expectations, the product life cycle has become shorter and inventory becomes obsolete much faster.\n", "\nObsolete inventory is inventory that a company still has on hand after it should have been sold. When inventory can\u2019t be sold in the markets, it declines significantly in value and could be deemed useless to the company. To recognize the fall in value, obsolete inventory must be written-down or written-off in the financial statements in accordance with\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gaap.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">generally accepted accounting principles</a> (GAAP).\n", "\nA <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/writedown.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">write-down</a> occurs if the market value of the inventory falls below the cost reported on the financial statements. A <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inventory-write-off.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">write-off</a> involves completely taking the inventory off the books when it is identified to have no value and, thus, cannot be sold.\n", "\nGAAP requires companies to establish an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inventoryreserve.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">inventory reserve</a> account for obsolete inventory on their <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancesheet.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">balance sheets</a> and expense their obsolete inventory as they dispose of it, which reduces profits or results in losses. Companies report inventory obsolescence by debiting an expense account and crediting a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/contraaccount.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">contra\u00a0asset account</a>.\n", "\nWhen an expense account is debited, this identifies that the money spent on the inventory, now obsolete, is an expense. A contra\u00a0asset account is reported on the balance sheet immediately below the asset account to which it relates, and it\u00a0reduces the net reported value of the asset account.\n", "\nExamples of expense accounts include <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cogs.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cost of goods sold</a>, inventory obsolescence accounts,\u00a0and loss on inventory write-down. A contra\u00a0asset account may include an allowance for obsolete inventory and an obsolete inventory reserve. When the inventory write-down is small, companies typically charge the cost of goods sold account. However, when the write-down is large, it is better to charge the expense to an alternate account.\n", "\nFor example, a company identifies\u00a0$8,000 worth of obsolete inventory. It then\u00a0estimates that the inventory can still be sold in the market for $1,500\u00a0and proceeds to write-down the inventory value. Since the value of inventory has fallen from $8,000 to $1,500, the difference represents the reduction in value that needs to be reported in the accounting journal, that is, $8,000 - $1,500 = $6,500.\n", "\nThe allowance for obsolete inventory account is a reserve that is maintained as a contra\u00a0asset account so that the original cost of the inventory can be held on the inventory account until it is disposed of. When the obsolete inventory is finally disposed of, both the inventory asset and the allowance for obsolete inventory is cleared.\n", "\nFor example, if the company disposes of its obsolete inventory by throwing it away, it would not receive the sales value of $1,500. Therefore, in addition to writing-off the inventory, the company also needs to recognize an additional expense of $1,500. The allowance for obsolete inventory will be released by creating this <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/adjusting-journal-entry.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">journal entry</a>:\n", "\nThe journal entry removes the value of the obsolete inventory both from the allowance for obsolete inventory account and from the inventory account itself.\n", "\nAlternatively, the company could have disposed of the inventory for some money, say through an auction for $800. In this case, the proceeds of $800 from the auction is $700 less than the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bookvalue.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">book value</a> of $1,500. The amount of $700 will be charged to an expense account, and the journal entry will record the disposal of the inventory and receipt of $800 in proceeds from the auction:\n", "\nThe $1,500\u00a0net value of the inventory\u00a0less the $800\u00a0proceeds from the sale\u00a0has created an additional loss on disposal of $700, which is charged to the cost of goods sold account.\n", "\nA large amount\u00a0of obsolete inventory is\u00a0a warning sign for investors. It can be symptomatic of poor products, poor management forecasts of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/demand.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">demand</a>,\u00a0and/or poor inventory management. Looking at the amount of obsolete inventory a company creates will give investors an idea of how well the product is selling and how effective the company's inventory process is.\n"]}
