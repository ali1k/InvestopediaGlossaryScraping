This tenancy is most commonly found in residential leases. In situations where there is no written agreement, tenancy is also considered to be on a month-to-month basis.\n", "\nTenancy falls under the real estate laws that cover <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lease.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">leases</a>. In legal real estate terminology, a lease is a contract between the owner of a property, also known as the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/landlord.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">landlord</a>, and a tenant, who rents the property. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/090315/millennials-guide-how-read-lease.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The lease transfers the owner\u2019s rights</a> to the exclusive possession and use of the property to the tenant for an agreed-upon period.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/younginvestors/07/ready_to_rent.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">As anyone who has rented an apartment knows</a>, the lease sets forth the period of time for which the contract is to run and the amount of rent the tenant is contracted to pay. The renter gains access to the property and uses it in whatever manner was agreed upon in the lease. The landlord receives rent for a specified period of time, and after the lease period is up their ownership rights are returned.\n", "\nWhether a month-to-month tenancy is advantageous or disadvantageous depends, in part, on a renter's or landlord's desire for flexibility and ability to respond quickly to changing circumstances.\n", "\nWithin the lease contract, the tenant\u2019s legal right to possess the property is deemed the leasehold estate\u2014or tenancy. Depending upon the contract\u2019s language, the following four different tenancies can be established:\n", "\nThis establishes a possession for the tenant that will last for a fixed time period, which could range from days to years. It has a specific starting and ending date, with the latter signifying the expiration of the renter\u2019s tenancy.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nThis is established when the renter\u2019s possession is contracted for an indefinite period, with no agreed-upon expiration date.\u00a0The tenancy is originally created for a specific period, but the renter\u2019s tenancy can continue until there is some notification of the lease\u2019s termination. Under the terms of the lease, the contract is automatically renewable until the owner or renter gives a notice to terminate.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nA <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tenancy-at-will.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tenancy at will</a> gives the renter the right to use the property for an unspecified period. The tenancy continues until the owner or renter gives notice of termination.

This can occur when the renter does not surrender the property after the initial expiration date written into the lease. It usually leads to eviction proceedings being instituted by the owner. If, however, the landlord accepts a rent payment after the lease expiration date, the property is considered to be leased again, but now on a month-to-month basis.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n"]}
