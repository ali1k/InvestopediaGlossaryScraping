The EMU's succession over the EMS occurred through a three phase process, with the third and final phase initiating the adoption of the common <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eur.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">euro currency</a> in place of former national currencies. This has been completed by all initial EU members except for the United Kingdom and Denmark, who have opted out of adopting the euro.\u00a0The U.K. subsequently left the EMU in 2020 following the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brexit.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brexit</a> referendum.\n", "\nThe first efforts to create a European Economic and Monetary Union began after World War I. On September 9, 1929, Gustav Stresemann, at an assembly of the League of Nations, asked, \"Where is the European currency, the European stamp that we need?\" Stresemann's\u00a0lofty rhetoric quickly became\u00a0folly, however, when little more than a month later the Wall Street crash of 1929 marked the symbolic onset of the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/great_depression.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Great Depression</a>, which not only derailed talk of a common currency, it also split Europe politically and paved the way for the Second World War.\n", "\nThe modern history of the EMU was reignited with a speech given by Robert Schuman, the French Foreign Minister at the time, on May 9, 1950, that later came to be called The Schuman\u00a0Declaration.\u00a0Schuman argued that the only way to ensure peace in Europe, which had been torn apart twice in thirty years by devastating wars, was to bind Europe as a single economic entity: \"The pooling of coal and steel production ... will change the destinies of those regions which have long been devoted to the manufacture of munitions of war, of which they have been the most constant victims.\" His speech led to the Treaty of Paris\u00a0in 1951 that created the\u00a0European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) between treaty signers\u00a0Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the\u00a0Netherlands.\n", "\nThe ECSC was consolidated under the Treaties of Rome into the European Economic Community (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/european-community.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">EEC</a>). The Treaty of Paris was not a permanent treaty and was set to expire in 2002. To ensure a more permanent union, European politicians proposed plans in the 1960s and 1970s, including the Werner Plan, but world-wide, destabilizing economic events, like the end of the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brettonwoodsagreement.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bretton\u00a0Woods currency agreement</a> and the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/08/1970-stagflation.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">oil and inflation shocks of the</a> 1970s, delayed concrete steps to European integration.\n", "\nIn 1988, Jacques Delors, the President of the\u00a0European Commission, was asked to convene an ad hoc committee of member states' central bank governors to propose a concrete plan to further economic integration. Delors's\u00a0report led to the creation of the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maastricht-treaty.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Maastricht Treaty</a> in 1992. The Maastricht Treaty was responsible for the establishment\u00a0of the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/europeanunion.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">European Union</a>.\n", "\nOne\u00a0of the Maastricht Treaty's priorities was economic policy and the convergence of EU member state economies.\u00a0So, the treaty\u00a0established\u00a0a timeline for the creation and implementation of the EMU.

Consequently, all member states were able to borrow in euros at low-interest rates during the period before the global financial crisis, but <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond-yield.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bond yields</a> did not reflect the different credit-worthiness of member countries.\n", "\nGreece represents the most high-profile example of the flaws in the EMU. Greece\u00a0revealed in 2009 that it had been understating the severity of its deficit since adopting the euro in 2001, and\u00a0the country suffered one of the worst economic crises in recent history. Greece accepted two <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bailout.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bailouts</a> from the EU in five years, and short of leaving the EMU, future bailouts will be necessary for Greece to continue to pay its creditors. Greece's\u00a0initial deficit was caused by its failure to collect adequate\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxes.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tax revenue</a>, coupled with a rising <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unemploymentrate.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">unemployment rate</a>. The current unemployment rate in Greece as of April 2019 is 18%. In July\u00a02015, Greek officials announced capital controls and\u00a0a bank holiday and restricted the number of euros\u00a0that could be removed per day.\n", "\nThe EU has given Greece an ultimatum: accept strict <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/austerity.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">austerity</a> measures, which many Greeks believe caused the crisis in the first place,\u00a0or leave the EMU. On July 5, 2015, Greece voted to reject EU austerity measures, prompting speculation that <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/grexit.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Greece might exit the EMU</a>.

The cost of imports, on which Greece is very dependent, would increase dramatically as the buying power of the drachma declines relative to the euro. The new Greek central bank might be tempted to print money to maintain basic services, which could lead to severe inflation or, in the worst case scenario, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hyperinflation.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hyperinflation</a>.

On the other hand, if the Greek economy\u00a0recovers or thrives after leaving the EMU and European imposed austerity, other countries, such as Italy, Spain, and Portugal, may question the tight\u00a0austerity of the euro and also be moved to leave the EMU.\n", "\nAs of 2020, Greece remains in the EMU, though tensions anti-Greek sentiment is on the rise\u00a0in Germany, which could contribute to already building tensions in the EU and EMU.\u00a0\u00a0\n"]}
