It includes (but is not limited to) wages, salaries, tips, bonuses, rents, royalties, and interest income from bonds and commissions.\n", "\nOrdinary income comes in two forms: personal income and business income. From a personal perspective, ordinary income can be defined as any kind of cash inflow that is subject to income tax, as outlined by the IRS.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"11\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nIn a corporate setting, the term refers to any type of income generated from regular day-to-day business operations, excluding any income earned from the sale of long-term <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalasset.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">capital assets</a>, such as land or equipment.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"11\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nLet's take a look at how ordinary income works for individuals and businesses in the following examples.\n", "\nFor private individuals, ordinary income typically consists of the salaries and wages they earn from their employers before tax. If, for example, a person holds a customer service job at Target and earns $3,000 per month, their annual ordinary income can be calculated by multiplying $3,000 by 12.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"9\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nIf this customer service employee has no other income sources, $36,000 is the amount that would be taxed on their year-end tax return as gross income. Alternatively, if the same person also owned property and earned $1,000 a month in rental income, their ordinary income would increase to $48,000 per year.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"8\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nFor businesses, ordinary income is the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profitbeforetax.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pretax profit</a> earned from selling its product(s) or service(s).
