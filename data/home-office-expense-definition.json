This includes offices supplies, phone lines and computer equipment. The amount of deductions permitted will depend on several factors, including how a homeowner files their return and their earnings, but most will be able to claim several items as expenses as long as they are incurred during the normal course of business.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nA home office will only qualify for home office deductions if it meets the following criteria:<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"15\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nThe rule of thumb is \"exclusive and regular\": the place you designate as your home office has to be used exclusively and regularly as a home office. In the words of the IRS, \"The space does not need to be marked off by a permanent partition.

The first way (the \"regular\" method) is to calculate your actual expenses. The second way is called the \"simplified\" method, which is faster but may not yield as many deductions.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nThe method that uses an accounting of your actual expenses begins with calculating the following:<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"16\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nDirect expenses are things like painting or repairs only in the area used for business.

They have a dedicated office space which is approximately 200 square feet, a cell phone that is only used for work-related calls and a subscription to a magazine that provides editorial leads to writers. All these items are tax-deductible as home office expenses, including the 200 square feet of the writer\u2019s house, since that room is used for business purposes.\n", "\nAdditionally, the writer can deduct the ink that they use to print contracts out, the full cost of the all-in-one printer that they had to purchase to be able to send those signed contracts in and any industry-related training they complete.\n", "\nThere are a variety of expenses that can be deducted when a person works out of their home, whether it be as a remote employee or because they are self-employed. A certified <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tax-accounting.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tax</a> specialist can review available deductions and make sure that all items that are being claimed are valid.\n", "\nFor instance, if this freelance writer didn\u2019t have a dedicated office space and instead worked out of the coffee shop around the corner from their house every day, they wouldn\u2019t be able to claim the utility and mortgage associated costs as part of their home office deduction. There may be additional deductions available to them, like the coffee and donut they purchase each day while working out of the shop.\n"]}
