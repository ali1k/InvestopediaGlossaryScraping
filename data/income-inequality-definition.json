The less equal the distribution, the higher income inequality is.

Populations can be divided up in different ways to show different levels and forms of income inequality such as income inequality by sex or race.

Segmentations of income disparity analysis are used for analyzing different types of income distributions. Income distributions by demographic segmentation form the basis for studying income inequality and income disparity.\n", "\nThe different types of income segmentations studied when analyzing income inequality may include distributions for:\n", "\nThere are several prominent case studies and analysis reports providing insight on income inequality, income disparity, and income distributions in the U.S. and across the world.\n", "\nThe Urban Institute is one source for insight on income inequality.
