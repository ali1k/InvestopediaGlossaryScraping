Counterparty risk can exist in credit, investment, and trading transactions.\n", "\nVarying degrees of counterparty risk exists in all financial transactions. Counterparty risk is also known as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/defaultrisk.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">default risk</a>. Default risk is the chance that companies or individuals will be unable to make the required payments on their debt obligations. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lender.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lenders</a> and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investor.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">investors</a> are exposed to default risk in virtually all forms of credit extensions. Counterparty risk is a risk that both parties should consider when evaluating a contract.\n", "\nIf one party has a higher risk of default, a premium is usually attached to the transaction to compensate the other party. The premium added due to counterparty risk is called a risk premium.\n", "\nIn retail and commercial financial transactions, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditreport.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">credit reports</a> are often used by creditors to determine the counterparty's credit risk. Credit scores of borrowers are analyzed and monitored to gauge the level of risk to the creditor. A <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/081115/getting-your-credit-score-bank.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">credit score</a> is a numerical value of an individual's or company's creditworthiness, which is based on many variables.\n", "\nA person's credit score ranges from 300 to 850, and the higher the score, the more financially trustworthy a person is considered to be to the creditor. Numerical values of credit scores are listed below:\n", "\nMany factors impact a credit score including a client's payment history, the total amount of debt, length of credit history, and credit utilization, which is the percentage of a borrower\u2019s total available credit that is currently being utilized.\u00a0The numerical value of a borrower's credit score reflects the level of counterparty risk to the lender or creditor. A borrower with a credit score of 750 would have low counterparty risk while a borrower with a credit score of 450 would carry high counterparty risk.\n", "\nIf the borrower has a low credit score, the creditor will likely charge a higher interest rate or premium due to the risk of default on the debt. Credit card companies, for example, charge interest rates in excess of 20% for those with low credit scores while simultaneously offer 0% interest for customers that have stellar credit or high credit scores. If the borrower is delinquent on payments by 60 days or more or exceeds the card's credit limit, credit card companies usually tack on a risk premium or a \"<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www.thebalance.com/credit-card-default-and-penalty-rates-explained-960643\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">penalty rate</a>,\" which can bring the interest rate of the card to over 29% annually.\n", "\nFinancial investment products such as stocks, options, bonds, and derivatives carry counterparty risk. Bonds are rated by agencies, such as Moody's and Standard and Poor's, from AAA to junk bond status to gauge the level of counterparty risk. Bonds that carry higher counterparty risk pay\u00a0higher yields. When counterparty risk is minimal, the premiums or interest rates are low, such as with <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/money-marketfund.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">money market funds</a>.\n", "\nFor example, a company that offers junk bonds will have a high yield to compensate investors for the added risk that the company could default on its obligations. Conversely, a U.S. Treasury bond has low counterparty risk and therefore; rated higher than corporate debt and junk bonds. However, treasuries typically pay a lower yield than corporate debt since there's a lower risk of default.\n", "\nWhen the counterparty risk is miscalculated and a party defaults, the impending damage can be severe. For example, the default of so many collateralized debt obligations (CDO) was a major cause of the real estate collapse in 2008.\n", "\nMortgages are securitized into CDOs for investment and backed by the underlying assets. One of the major flaws of CDOs before the economic crash was that they contained subprime and low-quality mortgages, whereby the CDOs were given the same high-grade ratings as corporate debt.\n", "\nThe high credit rating for CDOs allowed them to receive institutional investment since funds are required to invest only in highly rated debt. When borrowers began defaulting on mortgage payments, the real estate bubble burst, leaving the investors, banks, and reinsurers on the hook for massive losses.\u00a0The ratings agencies received a lot of blame for the collapse, which eventually led to the financial market meltdown that defined the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearmarket.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bear market</a> of 2007\u20132009.\n", "\nAIG or American International Group offers insurance products for real estate, businesses, and individuals. The company needed a bailout from the U.S. government during the financial crisis. For those who were insured by AIG, they suddenly faced an increase in counterparty risk. As a result, investors must consider the company that's issuing the bond, stock, or insurance policy to assess whether there's counterparty risk.\n"]}
