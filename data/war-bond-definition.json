Because war bonds offered a rate of return below the market rate, investment was achieved by making emotional appeals to patriotic citizens to lend the government money.\n", "\nA war bond is a debt instrument issued by a government as a means of borrowing money to finance its defense initiatives and military efforts during times of war. A war bond is essentially a loan to a government. In the U.S., the sale of war bonds was overseen by the War Finance Committee. War bonds were initially known as Defense Bonds and were first issued as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liberty-bond.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Liberty Bonds</a> in 1917 to finance the United States government participation in World War I. Through the sale of these bonds, the government raised $21.5 billion dollars for its war efforts.\n", "\nAfter the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Dec. 7, 1941, the U.S. entered the Second World War, and Defense Bonds were renamed War Bonds. More than 80 million Americans purchased war bonds and brought in over $180 billion in revenue. The bonds sold for 50% to 75% of their <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/facevalue.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">face value</a> and had denominations ranging from $10 to $1,000, depending on the year they were issued.\n", "\nThe bonds were sold below their face value\u2014investors paid less than the face value initially and were paid the face value amount at maturity. In other words, war bonds were considered <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/z/zero-couponbond.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">zero-coupon bonds</a> because they didn't pay interest payments throughout the year or coupon payments. Instead, investors earned the difference between the purchase price and the face value of the bond at maturity.\n", "\nWar bonds were baby bonds, which meant they had smaller <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/parvalue.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">par values</a>, or face values, than standard bonds. This made them more affordable for retail investors. Another feature of the bonds was that they were nontransferable\u2014only the bond purchaser could redeem the bonds in the future. War bonds originally had a 10-year maturity, which resulted in a 2.9% return.\n", "\nCongress extended the interest that could be earned so that bonds sold from 1941 to 1965 <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accruedinterest.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">accrued interest</a> for 40 years. Bonds issued after 1965 accrued interest for 20 years. After the end of World War II, War Bonds became known as Series E bonds. The U.S. government continued issuing Series E bonds until 1980 when Series EE bonds replaced them.\n", "\nBesides the United States government, other countries also issued war bonds, including Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Austria-Hungary.\n", "\nIn the U.S., the War Advertising Council promoted voluntary compliance with bond buying. Motives to purchase war bonds were embedded in patriotism and conscience, given that these bonds offered a rate of return that was below the prevailing interest rates in the market.\n", "\nAdvertisements for the bonds were carried out through multiple media such as radio stations, newspapers, magazines, and newsreels in theaters to reach the American people. Hollywood stars like Bette Davis and Rita Hayworth helped promote war bonds by touring the country. People could save up for War Bonds by contributing 25 cents each time. The Girl Scouts also sold stamps valued at 10 cents each. Norman Rockwell created several paintings as part of the advertising effort for War Bonds.\n", "\nAlthough War Bonds are not sold any longer, as an example, let's assume an investor purchased a war bond and held it until its maturity in 10 years. The bond was purchased for $75, or at a discount to the $100 face value of the bond. The investor holds the bond for 10 years and is paid no-interest payments over those 10 years. At maturity, the investor cashes in the bond and is paid the $100 face value.\n"]}
