This method of valuation gained popularity as an alternative to the dividend discount model (DDM), especially if a company does not pay a dividend. Although FCFE may calculate the amount available to shareholders, it does not necessarily equate to the amount paid out to shareholders.\n", "\nAnalysts use FCFE to determine if dividend payments and stock repurchases are paid for with free cash flow to equity or some other form of financing. Investors want to see a dividend payment and share repurchase that is fully paid by FCFE.\n", "\nIf FCFE is less than the dividend payment and the cost to buy back shares, the company is funding with either debt or existing capital or issuing new securities.

Some analysts argue that borrowing to pay for share repurchases when shares are trading at a discount, and rates are historically low is a good investment. However, this is only the case if the company's share price goes up in the future.\n", "\nIf the company's dividend payment funds are significantly less than the FCFE, then the firm is using the excess to increase its cash level or to invest in marketable securities. Finally, if the funds spent to buy back shares or pay dividends is approximately equal to the FCFE, then the firm is paying it all to its investors.\n", "\nUsing the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gordongrowthmodel.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gordon Growth Model</a>, the FCFE is used to calculate the value of equity using this formula:\n", "\n<span data-value=\"V_\\text{equity} = \\frac{\\text{FCFE}}{\\left(r-g\\right)}\">\ufeff<span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\">\n<math>\n<semantics>\n<mrow>\n<msub>\n<mi>\nV\n</mi>\n<mtext>\nequity\n</mtext>\n</msub>\n<mo>\n=\n</mo>\n<mfrac>\n<mrow>\n<mtext>\nFCFE\n</mtext>\n</mrow>\n<mrow>\n<mrow>\n<mo>\n(\n</mo>\n<mi>\nr\n</mi>\n<mo>\n\u2212\n</mo>\n<mi>\ng\n</mi>\n<mo>\n)\n</mo>\n</mrow>\n</mrow>\n</mfrac>\n</mrow>\n<annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\nV_\\text{equity} = \\frac{\\text{FCFE}}{\\left(r-g\\right)}\n</annotation>\n</semantics>\n</math></span><span class=\"katex-html\"><span class=\"strut\"></span><span class=\"strut bottom\"></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathit\">V</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t vlist-t2\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\"><span class=\"\"><span class=\"pstrut\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord text mtight\"><span class=\"mord mathrm mtight\">equity</span></span></span></span></span><span class=\"vlist-s\">\u200b</span></span><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\"></span></span></span></span></span><span class=\"mrel\">=</span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mopen nulldelimiter\"></span><span class=\"mfrac\"><span class=\"vlist-t vlist-t2\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\"><span class=\"\"><span class=\"pstrut\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\"><span class=\"minner mtight\"><span class=\"mopen mtight delimcenter\"><span class=\"mtight\">(</span></span><span class=\"mord mathit mtight\">r</span><span class=\"mbin mtight\">\u2212</span><span class=\"mord mathit mtight\">g</span><span class=\"mclose mtight delimcenter\"><span class=\"mtight\">)</span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=\"\"><span class=\"pstrut\"></span><span class=\"frac-line\"></span></span><span class=\"\"><span class=\"pstrut\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\"><span class=\"mord text mtight\"><span class=\"mord mathrm mtight\">FCFE</span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=\"vlist-s\">\u200b</span></span><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\"></span></span></span></span><span class=\"mclose nulldelimiter\"></span></span></span></span></span></span>\ufeff\n", "\n<em>Where:</em>\n", "\nThis model is used to find the value of the equity claim of a company and is only appropriate to use if capital expenditure is not significantly greater than depreciation and if the beta of the company's stock is close to 1 or below 1.\n"]}
