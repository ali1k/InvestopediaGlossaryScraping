For example, large banks must protect their current <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/networth.asp\">net worth</a>, whereas pension funds have the obligation of payments after a number of years. These institutions are both concerned about protecting the future value of their portfolios and must deal\u00a0with uncertain future interest rates.\n", "\nImmunization helps large firms and institutions\u00a0protect their portfolios from exposure to interest rate fluctuations. Using a perfect immunization strategy, firms can nearly guarantee that movements in interest rates will have virtually no impact on the value of their portfolios.\n", "\nImmunization is considered a \"quasi-active\" risk mitigation strategy since it has the characteristics of both active and passive strategies. By definition, pure immunization implies that a portfolio is invested for a defined return for a specific period of time regardless of any outside influences, such as changes in interest rates.\n", "\nThe\u00a0opportunity cost\u00a0of using the immunization strategy is potentially giving up the upside potential of an active strategy for the assurance that the portfolio will achieve the intended desired return. As in the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/buyandhold.asp\">buy-and-hold strategy</a>, by design, the instruments best suited for this strategy are high-grade bonds with remote possibilities of\u00a0default. In fact, the purest form of immunization would be to invest in a\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/z/zero-couponbond.asp\">zero-coupon bond</a> and match the maturity of the bond to the date on which the cash flow is expected to be needed. This eliminates any variability of return, positive or negative, associated with the reinvestment of cash flows.\n", "\nDuration, or the\u00a0average life\u00a0of a bond (which is also its price sensitivity to changes in interest rates), is commonly used in immunization. It is a much more accurate predictive measure of a bond's volatility than maturity. This strategy is commonly used in the institutional investment environment by insurance companies, pension funds, and banks to match the time horizon of their future liabilities with structured cash flows. It is one of the soundest strategies and can be used successfully by individuals. For example, just like a\u00a0pension fund\u00a0would use an immunization to plan for cash flows upon an individual's retirement, that same individual could build a\u00a0dedicated portfolio\u00a0for their own retirement plan.\n", "\nImmunization can be accomplished by cash flow matching, duration matching, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/convexity.asp\">convexity</a> matching, and trading forwards, futures and options on bonds. Similar strategies can be used to immunize other financial risks such as exchange rate risk. Often investors and portfolio managers use hedging techniques to reduce specific risks. Hedging strategies are usually imperfect, but if a perfect hedging strategy is in place, it is technically an immunization strategy.\n", "\nAssume an investor needs to pay a $10,000 obligation in five years. To immunize against this definite cash outflow, the investor can purchase a security that guarantees a $10,000 inflow in five years. A five-year zero-coupon bond with a redemption value of $10,000 would be suitable. By purchasing this bond, the investor matches the expected inflow and outflow of cash, and any change in interest rates would not affect his ability to pay the obligation in five years.\n", "\nTo immunize a bond portfolio using the duration method, an investor must match the portfolio's duration to the investment time horizon in question. If an investor has a $10,000 obligation in five years, there are a few ways in which he can use duration matching. First, an investor can purchase a zero-coupon bond that matures in five years and equals $10,000. Second, an investor can purchase several <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/couponbond.asp\">coupon bonds</a> that each have a five-year duration and a total of $10,000. Third, an investor can purchase several coupon bonds that total $10,000 but have an average duration of five years when viewed together.\n", "\nIt is possible to make a profit using duration matching, all that needs to be done is to construct a bond portfolio in a way that the portfolio's convexity is higher than the convexity of the liabilities.\n", "\nPortfolio immunization using duration and cash-flow matching are two types of dedication strategies to safeguard the funding of liabilities when due. Immunization via duration matching aims to balance the opposing effects interest rates have on the price return and reinvestment return of a coupon bond. A multiple liability immunization strategy pays off better when the interest rate shifts are not too arbitrary. It requires a lower\u00a0investment than cash flow matching but does carry reinvestment risk in the case of non-parallel rate shifts.\n", "\nCash flow matching, on the other hand, relies on the availability of securities with specific\u00a0principals, coupons, and maturities to work efficiently. This is far-fetched in most practical cases, and so this strategy requires more cash investment and runs the risk of\u00a0excess cash\u00a0balances accumulating and being reinvested at very low rates in between liabilities.\n", "\nDue to these factors, multiple liability immunization is generally superior to cash flow matching. Linear programming and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/managing-wealth/achieve-optimal-asset-allocation/\">optimization techniques</a> are used to extend and even combine the two strategies in order to achieve even better results.\n"]}
