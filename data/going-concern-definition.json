This term also refers to a company's ability to make enough money to stay afloat or to avoid <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bankruptcy.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bankruptcy</a>. If a business is not a going concern, it means it's gone bankrupt and its assets were\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidate.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">liquidated</a>. As an example, many dot-coms are no longer going concern companies after the tech bust in the late 1990s.\n", "\nAccountants use going concern principles to decide what types of reporting should appear on financial statements. Companies that are a going concern may defer reporting <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/longtermassets.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">long-term assets</a> at current value or liquidating value, but rather at cost. A company remains a going concern when the sale of assets does not impair its ability to continue operation, such as the closure of a small branch office that reassigns the employees to other departments within the company.\n", "\nAccountants who view a company as a going concern generally\u00a0believe a firm uses its assets wisely and does not have to liquidate anything. Accountants may also employ going concern principles to determine how a company should proceed with any sales of assets, reduction of expenses, or shifts to other products.\n", "\nGoing concern is not included in the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gaap.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">generally accepted accounting principles</a> (GAAP) but is included in the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gaas.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">generally accepted auditing standards</a> (GAAS).\n", "\nCertain <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/redflag.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">red flags</a> may appear on financial statements of publicly traded companies that may indicate a business will not be a going concern\u00a0in the future. Listing of long-term assets normally does not appear in a company's quarterly statements or as a line item on balance sheets. Listing the value of long-term assets may indicate a company plans to sell these assets.\n", "\nA firm's inability to meet its obligations without substantial restructuring or selling of assets may also indicate it is not a going concern. If a company acquires assets during a time of restructuring, it may plan to resell them later.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accounting-standard.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Accounting standards</a> try to determine what a company should disclose on its financial statements if there are doubts about its ability to continue as a going concern. In May 2014, the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fasb.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Financial Accounting Standards Board</a>\u00a0determined financial statements should reveal the conditions that support an entity's substantial doubt that it can continue as a going concern.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff Statements should also show management's interpretation of the conditions and management's future\u00a0plans.\n", "\nIn general, an auditor examines a company's financial statements to see if it can continue as a going concern for one year following the time of an audit. Conditions that lead to substantial doubt about a going concern include negative trends in operating results, continuous losses from one period to the next, loan defaults, lawsuits against a company, and denial of credit by suppliers.\n"]}
