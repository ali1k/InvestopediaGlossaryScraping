Therefore, when viewing stock quotes from any financial website, be aware of the time that is posted near the stock quote to verify whether the quote is actually in real-time.\n", "\nPossessing accurate real-time quotes is especially important for traders, as even the smallest time discrepancy between a provided quote and the real-time situation can change a profitable position into a loss.\n", "\nStock quotes reflect the results of actual trading on stock market exchanges, such as the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/03/103103.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ</a>. Investors and\u00a0traders can get\u00a0quotes on the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/djia.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dow Jones Industrial Average</a>, other indices or individual stocks from any number of financial news sources. However, some financial news services don\u2019t report real-time information and\u00a0instead\u00a0delay stock quotes for 15 or 20 minutes.\u00a0\n", "\nActively traded stocks can fluctuate price dramatically\u00a0from minute to minute or\u00a0from second to second. That's why knowing the current price is imperative. In a rapidly rising or falling market, also known as a fast market, even real-time quotes can have a hard time keeping up. In that market scenario, a quote that\u2019s delayed 15 or 20 minutes is virtually useless, as a stock could have moved by a significant percentage in that time frame.\u00a0<em>\u00a0</em>\n", "\nDelayed quotes are\u00a0usually enough information for a casual investor who isn\u2019t looking to time the market. For example, if a trader\u00a0has\u00a0a long-term portfolio of stocks they\u00a0don\u2019t intend to sell, they\u00a0don\u2019t need up-to-the-second price information. Delayed provide a\u00a0general ballpark of where stocks and indexes\u00a0are, and whether they are trending up or down.\n", "\nProviding real-time quotes takes effort and technology; thus, this service has a cost. If firms don\u2019t want to absorb this cost, they\u2019ll only offer delayed quotes. Reuters, for example, provides lots of financial information, but its stock quotes are delayed at least 15 minutes.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\u00a0Financial news services often offer real-time\u00a0quotes as a premium subscription service.\n"]}
