It is an example of a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sucker-rally.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sucker's rally</a>.\n", "\nA dead cat bounce is a price pattern used by technical analysts. It is considered a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/continuationpattern.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">continuation pattern</a>, where at first the bounce may appear to be a reversal of the prevailing trend, but it is quickly followed by a continuation of the downward price move. It becomes a dead cat bounce (and not a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reversal.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reversal</a>) after the price drops below its prior low.\n", "\nFrequently, downtrends are interrupted by brief periods of recovery, or small <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rally.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">rallies</a>, when prices temporarily rise. This can be a result of traders or investors closing out <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/short.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">short positions</a> or buying on the assumption that the security has reached a bottom.\n", "\nA dead cat bounce is a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/technical/112601.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">price pattern</a> that is usually recognized in hindsight. Analysts may attempt to predict that the recovery will be only temporary by using certain technical and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundamentalanalysis.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fundamental analysis</a> tools. A dead cat bounce can be seen in the broader economy, such as during the depths of a recession, or it can be seen in the price of an individual stock or group of stocks.\n", "\nSimilar to identifying a market peak or trough, recognizing a dead cat bounce ahead of time is fraught with difficulty, even for skilled investors. In March 2009, for example, economist Nouriel Roubini of New York University referred to the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2009/03/roubini-reflections-on-latest-suckers.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">incipient stock market recovery</a> as a dead cat bounce, predicting that the market would reverse course in short order and plummet to new lows. Instead, March 2009 marked the beginning of a protracted <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bullmarket.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bull market</a>, eventually surpassing its pre-recession high.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\n", "\nLet's consider a historical example. Stock prices for Cisco Systems peaked at $82 per share in March 2000 before falling to $15.81 in March 2001 amid the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dotcom-bubble.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">dot-com collapse</a>.\n", "\nCisco saw many dead cat bounces in the ensuing years. The stock recovered to $20.44 by November 2001, only to fall to $10.48 by September 2002. Fast forward to June 2016 and Cisco traded at $28.47 per share, barely one-third of its peak price during the tech bubble in 2000.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\n", "\nAs mentioned above, most of the time a dead cat bounce can only be identified after the fact. This means that traders that notice a rally after a steep decline may think it is a dead cat bounce when in reality it is a trend reversal signaling a prolonged upswing.\n", "\nHow can investors determine whether a current upward movement is a dead cat bounce or a market reversal? If we could answer this correctly all the time, we'd be able to make a lot of money. The fact is that there is no simple answer to spotting a market <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bottom.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bottom</a>.\n"]}
