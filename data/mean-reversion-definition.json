In cases of mean reversion, the thought is that any price that strays far from the long-term norm will again return, reverting to its understood state.\n", "\nThis theory has led to many <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investing.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">investing</a> strategies that involve the purchase or sale of stocks or other <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">securities</a> whose recent performances have differed greatly from their historical averages. However, a change in returns also could be a sign that a company no longer has the same prospects it once did, in which case it is less likely that mean reversion would occur.\n", "\nPercentage returns and prices are not the only measures considered in mean reverting; <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">interest rates</a> or even the P/E ratio of a company can be subject to this phenomenon.\n", "\nThe mean reversion theory is used as part of a statistical analysis of market conditions and can be part of an overall trading strategy. It applies well to the ideas of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/081415/look-buy-low-sell-high-strategy.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">buying low and selling high</a>, by hoping to identify abnormal activity that will, theoretically, revert to a normal pattern.\n", "\nMean reversion has also been used in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">options</a> pricing to describe the observation that an asset's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volatility.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">volatility</a> will fluctuate around some long-term average. One of the fundamental assumptions of many options pricing models is that an asset's price volatility is mean-reverting.\n", "\nAs the figure below depicts, the observed volatility of a stock can spike above or drop below its mean, but always seems to be bounded around its average level. High-volatility periods are typically followed by low-volatility periods and vice versa. Using mean reversion to identify volatility ranges combined with\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forecasting.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">forecasting</a>\u00a0techniques, investors can select the best possible trade.\n", "\nMean reversion trading in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equity.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">equities</a> tries to capitalize on extreme changes in the pricing of a particular security, assuming that it will revert to its previous state. This theory can be applied to both buying and selling, as it allows a trader to profit on unexpected upswings and to save on abnormal lows.\n", "\nThe return to a normal pattern is not guaranteed, as unexpected highs or lows could indicate a shift in the norm. Such events could include, but are not limited to, new product releases or developments on the positive side, or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/product_recall.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">recalls</a> and lawsuits on the negative side.\n", "\nAn asset could experience a mean reversion even in the most extreme event. But as with most market activity, there are few guarantees about how particular events will or will not affect the overall appeal of particular securities.\n"]}
