Reg B outlines the rules that lenders must adhere to when obtaining and processing credit information. The regulation prohibits lenders from discriminating based on age, gender, ethnicity, nationality, or marital status.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nAll lenders are required to comply with Regulation B when extending credit to borrowers. Reg B implements the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ecoa.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ECOA</a>), which is regulated and enforced by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-cfpb.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CFPB</a>). Congress enacted the ECOA to ensure that financial institutions and firms dealing with credit make it equally available to all <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-worthiness.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">creditworthy</a> customers. That means any feature that is not related to consumer credit cannot be used when making loan approval decisions.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nRegulation B covers the actions of a creditor before, during, and after a credit transaction. The CFPB lists credit transactions and aspects of credit transactions to include <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumercredit.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">consumer credit</a>, business credit, mortgage, and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/openendcredit.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">open-end credit</a>. This list also includes <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/refinance.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">refinancing</a>, credit applications, information requirements, standards of creditworthiness, investigation procedures, and revocation or termination of credit.\n", "\nWhen it comes to credit transactions, a creditor cannot discriminate:<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nRegulation B also mandates that lenders provide oral or written notice of rejection to failed applicants within 30 days of receiving their completed applications. The notice must explain why the applicant was rejected or give instructions for how the applicant can request this information. The spouses of rejected married applicants also have the right to this information. The information provided to applicants about the rejection helps them take constructive steps to build their credit. More importantly, it gives applicants the chance to correct the creditor's mistakes in evaluating the applicant's creditworthiness.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nUnder Regulation B, a lender may not request information about an applicant\u2019s sex, national origin, color, or other information not related to creditworthiness.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff However, there are certain times when such information can be collected from the applicant. For example, an applicant who puts down his home as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/collateral.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">collateral</a> will have additional information collected for monitoring compliance.\n", "\nFurthermore, an applicant's age can be requested if it appears that they cannot legally sign a contract. Creditors can ask about the number of children, their ages, and the borrower's financial obligations relating to the children. Marital status is also required if the applicant resides in a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/communityproperty.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">community property</a> state.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"5\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nA creditor may only request information from a loan applicant\u2019s spouse if:<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"5\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nThe most important benefit of Regulation B is that it helps to prevent discrimination against women and minorities. Regulation B's prohibition of advertising that would discourage potential applicants from applying for loans is a crucial part of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/redlining.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">redlining</a> cases. Redlining is an unethical and frequently illegal practice that denies loans or services to people living in majority-minority communities. Redlining has often been used to discriminate against Black Americans.\n", "\nReg B also helps anyone who is denied credit by requiring lenders to give them an explanation. Errors in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditreport.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">credit reports</a> are fairly common, and many people only find out about them after being denied credit. Without Regulation B's explanation requirement, many potential borrowers with errors in their credit reports would become discouraged and give up. Once people know the reason for the denial, there is a strong incentive to correct the credit reports and reapply.\n"]}
