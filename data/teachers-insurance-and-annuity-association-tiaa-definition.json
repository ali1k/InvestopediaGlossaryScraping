TIAA\u00a0has a history that dates back to the late Andrew Carnegie, whose Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching created the initial organization in order to service the pension needs of professors. The financial services company was\u00a0founded in 1918 with a $1 million\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/endowment.asp\">endowment</a> from the Carnegie Foundation.\u00a0It went by the name\u00a0TIAA-CREF, short for Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association\u2014College Retirement Equities Fund, until 2016, when it rebranded under the shortened name of\u00a0TIAA.\n", "\nIn 2010, TIAA\u00a0shifted its model to become a for-profit financial services corporation offering retirement products, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/529plan.asp\">529 College Savings Plans,</a> managed investment accounts, checking and savings products, mortgage loans, and other managed investment accounts. The main office is in\u00a0New York, and there are satellite offices in Denver, Dallas, and\u00a0Charlotte, N.C. Up until 1997, TIAA\u00a0operated as a tax-exempt non-profit organization. It is now organized as a non-profit organization that has taxable subsidiaries. All of TIAA's profits are disbursed to policyholders.\n", "\nTIAA's\u00a02016 rebranding\u00a0was meant to portray a simpler and cleaner image while acknowledging the company's 100-year history. The company continues to offer services to customers such as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ira.asp\">individual retirement accounts</a> (IRAs), mutual funds, annuities, brokerage, 529 plans, insurance, banking, home loans, and estate planning.\n", "\nAs of December 2017, TIAA\u00a0had more than 5 million active and retired employee accounts at more than 15,000 institutions, with $1\u00a0trillion under management.\u00a0It is the number-one-ranked asset manager of real assets in farmland and U.S. tax-exempt assets. It was ranked the number one 'Best Overall Large Fund company'\u00a0by the Thomson Reuters Lipper\u00a0Fund Awards for five\u00a0years in a row, from 2013-2017.\u00a0\n", "\nWhile the creation of TIAA in 1918 as a means of providing guaranteed lifetime income and insurance was a groundbreaking new resource for teachers and educators, it was the establishment of CREF in 1952 that started the company on the road to becoming a diversified financial services firm. Citing rapidly increasingly life expectancies, CREF allowed individuals the opportunity to add equity investments to their personal portfolios through a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/variableannuity.asp\">variable annuity</a> product. It was designed to use the higher expected returns of stocks to help stretch out the retirement income streams of workers. Fortune Magazine described CREF as \"the biggest development in the insurance investment business since the passage of the Social Security Act in 1935.\" TIAA\u00a0dropped CREF\u00a0from its name in 2016.\n", "\nSince 2012, TIAA\u00a0has made several acquisitions to grow its portfolio and product offerings.\n", "\nTIAA\u00a0has demonstrated a history of accepting investment strategies before the strategies became mainstream. In 1979, the company was one of the first to utilize a broad portfolio of international stocks as part of its investment strategy. In 1990, it added the CREF Social Choice Account to its lineup, giving customers a socially responsible investing option. In 1992, it introduced the Rollover IRA. In 1995, TIAA offered individuals the ability to invest in directly-owned real estate properties. In 1998, the company entered the 529 marketplace.\n", "\nAs of mid-2018, TIAA's CEO was\u00a0Roger Ferguson. He\u00a0joined the company in 2008. Previously, he was the head of financial services for insurer Swiss Re and chairman of Swiss Re American Holding Corp.\u00a0He is also the former vice-chairman of the Board of Governors of the U.S. Federal Reserve System.\n"]}
