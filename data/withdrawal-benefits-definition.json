Withdrawal benefits often take a week or more to process.\n", "\nEmployees age 55 or over receiving withdrawal benefits from a 401(k) may be allowed to take a lump-sum distribution from a defined-contribution plan without paying a penalty for early withdrawal.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"6\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff The same general idea applies for IRAs,\u00a0although the minimum age is 59\u00bd.
