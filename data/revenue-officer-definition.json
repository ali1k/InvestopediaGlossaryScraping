The specific duties of a revenue officer depend on the particular organization that employs the individual.\n", "\nA revenue officer is generally employed by a government agency, such as the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irs.asp\">Internal Revenue Service</a> (IRS) in the United States or the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/ccra.asp\">Canada Revenue Agency</a> (CRA) in Canada.

Their duties, therefore, include:\n", "\nA revenue officer with the IRS is also responsible for filing extensions on statutes of limitations for tax collection and initiating administrative and judicial actions. This position is often confused with that of a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/revenueagent.asp\">revenue agent</a>, who is instead tasked with conducting <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/audit.asp\">audits</a> of tax returns.\n", "\nWhile they are government employees, the IRS revenue officer does not carry a firearm or have the authority to arrest a taxpayer.

Revenue officers cover the more difficult tax cases. When the IRS has not been able to collect via letters, phone calls, tax levies, or garnishments, they send revenue officers.\u00a0\n", "\nThe role of a revenue agent is to determine tax liability via an audit. The audit that agents carry out is also known as an examination.\n", "\nRevenue officers don\u2019t generally have any <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accounting.asp\">accounting</a> training.

They are also responsible for overseeing the strategy for profitable revenue generation over the company's long term.\n", "\nA CRO\u2019s purpose is to align and optimize the entire customer experience with the aim of increasing revenue. The CRO mostly reports to the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cfo.asp\">chief financial officer</a> (CFO).\n", "\nThe role of a CRO was born in Silicon Valley to capitalize on new revenue opportunities created by digital products and services, particularly the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/software-as-a-service-saas.asp\">software-as-a-service</a> (SaaS) industry.
