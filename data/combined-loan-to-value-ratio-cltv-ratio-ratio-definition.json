The CLTV ratio is thus determined by dividing the sum of the items listed below by the lesser of the property's sales price or the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/appraised_value.asp\">appraised value</a> of the property.\n", "\nThe\u00a0combined loan to value (CLTV) ratio\u00a0is a calculation used by mortgage and lending professionals to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/031815/what-combined-loan-value-ratio.asp\">determine the total percentage</a> of a homeowner's property that is encumbered by liens (debt obligations). Lenders use the CLTV ratio along with with a handful of other calculations, such as the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dti.asp\">debt-to-income ratio</a>\u00a0and the standard\u00a0loan to value (LTV) ratio, to assess the risk of extending a loan to a borrower.\n", "\nMany economists attribute relaxed CLTV standards to the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreclosure-crisis.asp\">foreclosure crisis</a>\u00a0that plagued the United States during the late 2000s, among other factors. Beginning in the 1990s and especially during the early and mid-2000s, home buyers frequently took out second mortgages at the time of purchase in lieu of making down payments. Lenders eager not to lose these customers' business to competitors agreed to such terms despite the increased risk.\n", "\nPrior to the real estate bubble that expanded from the late 1990s to the mid-2000s, the standard practice was for home buyers to make down payments totaling at least 20% of the purchase price. Most lenders kept customers within these parameters by capping LTV at 80%.\n", "\nWhen the bubble began to heat up, many of these same companies took steps to allow customers to get around putting 20% down. Some lenders raised LTV caps or did away with them completely, offering mortgages with 5% down payments or less, while others kept LTV requirements in place but raised CLTV caps, often to 100%. This maneuver enabled customers to take out second mortgages to finance their 20% down payments.\n", "\nThe foreclosure spike beginning in 2008 underscored why CLTV is important. Having skin in the game, such as a $100,000 initial cash outlay for a $500,000 house, provides a homeowner with a powerful incentive to keep up his mortgage payments. If the bank forecloses, he not only loses his home but also the pile of cash he paid to close.\n", "\nRequiring equity in the property also insulates lenders from a dip in real estate prices. If a property is valued at $500,000 and the total liens add up to $400,000, the property can lose up to 20% of its value without any lien holders receiving a short payment at a foreclosure auction.\n", "\nSome home buyers choose to lower their down payment by receiving multiple mortgages on a property, which results in a lower loan-to-value ratio for the primary mortgage.\u00a0Also because of the lower LTV ratio, many home buyers successfully avoid private mortgage insurance (PMI). Whether it is better to obtain a second mortgage or incur the cost of PMI varies per individual.\n", "\nConsequently, because the second mortgagor assumes more risk, the interest rate on a second mortgage is typically higher than the interest rate on a first mortgage. It is advisable that consumers consider the advantages and disadvantages of accepting multiple loans on one property.\u00a0Exercising due diligence will help ensure that what is chosen is the best option for the given circumstances.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/loantovalue.asp\">Loan-to-value (LTV)</a> and CLTV are two of the most common ratios used during the mortgage underwriting process. Most lenders impose maximums on both values, above which the prospective borrower is not eligible for a loan. The LTV ratio considers only the primary mortgage balance. Therefore, in the above example, the LTV ratio is 50%, the result of dividing the primary mortgage balance of $100,000 by the home value of $200,000.\n", "\nMost lenders impose LTV maximums of 80% because Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac do not purchase mortgages with higher LTV ratios. Borrowers with good credit profiles can circumvent this requirement but must pay <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/insurance/\">private mortgage insurance\u00a0</a>(PMI) as long as their primary loan balance is greater than 80% of the home's value.\u00a0PMI protects the lender from losses when a home's value falls below the loan balance.\n", "\nPrimary lenders tend to be more generous with CLTV requirements. Considering the example above, in the event of a foreclosure, the primary mortgage holder receives its money in full before the second mortgage holder receives anything. If the property value decreases to $125,000 before the borrower defaults, the primary lien-holder receives the entire amount owed ($100,000), while the second lien-holder only receives the remaining $25,000 despite being owed $50,000. The primary lien-holder shoulders less risk in the case of declining property values and therefore can afford to lend at a higher CLTV.\n", "\nAs an example, suppose an individual is purchasing a home for $200,000. To secure the property, she provided a down payment of $50,000 and received two mortgages for $100,000 (primary) and $50,000 (secondary). Her combined loan-to-value ratio (CLTV) is therefore 75%: (($100,000 + $50,000) / $200,000).\n"]}
