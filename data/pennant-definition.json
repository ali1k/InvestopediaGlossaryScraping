The <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volume.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">volume</a> at each period of the pennant is also important. The initial move must be met with large volume while the pennant should have weakening volume, followed by a large increase in volume during the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/breakout.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">breakout</a>.\n", "\nHere's an example of what a pennant looks like:\n", "\nIn the image above, the flagpole represents the previous trend higher, the period of consolidation forms a pennant pattern, and traders watch for a breakout from the upper trend line of the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/symmetricaltriangle.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">symmetrical triangle</a>.\u00a0\n", "\nMany traders look to enter new <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">long</a> or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/short.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">short positions</a> following a breakout from the pennant chart pattern. For example, a trader may see that a bullish pennant is forming and place a limit buy order just above the pennant's upper <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trendline.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">trendline</a>. When the security breaks out, the trader may look for above average volume to confirm that pattern and hold the position until it reaches its price target.\n", "\nThe price target for pennants is often established by applying the initial flagpole's height to the point at which the price breaks out from the pennant. For instance, if\u00a0a stock rises from $5.00 to $10.00 in a sharp <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rally.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">rally</a>, consolidates to around $8.50, and then breaks out from the pennant at $9.00, a trader might look for a $14.00 price target on the position\u2014or $5.00 plus\u00a0$9.00. The <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stop-lossorder.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">stop-loss</a> level is often set at the lowest point of the pennant pattern, since a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/breakdown.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">breakdown</a> from these levels would invalidate the pattern and could mark the beginning of a longer-term reversal.\n", "\nMost traders use pennants in conjunction with other chart patterns or technical indicators that serve as confirmation. For example, traders may watch for <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rsi.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">relative strength index (RSI)</a> levels to moderate during the consolidation phase and reach oversold levels, which opens the door for a potential move higher. Or, the consolidation may occur near trendline <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/resistance.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">resistance levels</a>, where a breakout could create a new <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/support.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">support level</a>.\n", "\nLet's take a look at a real-life example of a pennant:\n", "\nIn the above example, the stock creates a pennant when it breaks out, experiences a period of consolidation, and then breaks out higher. The upper trend line resistance trend line of the pennant also corresponds to reaction highs. Traders could have watched for a breakout from these levels as a buying opportunity and profited from the subsequent breakout.\n"]}
