It refers to a legal process that instructs a third party to deduct payments directly from a debtor\u2019s wage or bank account.\u00a0\n", "\nTypically, the third party is the debtor\u2019s employer and is known as the garnishee. Federal law prohibits employers from firing a worker to avoid processing a garnishment payment.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff Garnishments are used for debts such as unpaid taxes, monetary fines, child support payments, and defaulted student loans.\u00a0\n", "\nFor a debtor\u2019s wage to be garnished, a creditor must typically obtain a court order proving that the debtor owes money and has defaulted on payment.\u00a0If the debt is an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irs.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Internal Revenue Service (IRS)</a> levy, a\u00a0court order is not required.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff For example, if John Smith owes $10,000 in overdue, unpaid taxes, the IRS can resort to garnishing his wages.\n", "\nThe IRS would then direct Smith's employer to remit a portion of his salary for a certain amount of time until Smith's tax obligation is fully paid. Because garnishments are usually the last resort to collect debts and show a debtor's unfavorable repayment history, they can harm an individual\u2019s credit rating.\n", "\nThe Consumer Credit Protection Act stipulates the amount of income that can be garnished from an individual's wage. The garnishment amount is the lower of the following:\n", "\nIndividuals who earn disposable income under $217.50\u00a0per week do not receive any wage garnishment.
