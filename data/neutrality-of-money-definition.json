In other words, the amount of money printed by the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalreservebank.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Federal Reserve</a> (Fed) and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/centralbank.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">central banks</a> can impact prices and wages but not the output or structure of the economy.\n", "\nModern versions of the theory accept that changes in the money supply might affect output or unemployment levels in the short run; however, many of today\u2019s <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economist.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">economists</a> still believe that neutrality is assumed in the long run after money circulates throughout the economy.\n", "\nThe neutrality of money theory is based on the idea that money is a \u201cneutral\u201d factor that has no real effect on <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economic-equilibrium.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">economic equilibrium</a>. Printing more money cannot change the fundamental nature of the economy, even if it drives up demand and leads to an increase in the prices of goods, services, and wages.\n", "\nAccording to the theory, all markets for all goods clear continuously. Relative prices adjust flexibly and always towards equilibrium. Changes in the supply of money do not appear to change the underlying conditions in the economy. New money neither creates nor destroys machines, and it does not introduce new trading partners or affect existing knowledge and skill. As a result,\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aggregatesupply.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">aggregate supply</a>\u00a0should remain constant.\n", "\nNot every economist agrees with this way of thinking and those who do generally believe that the neutrality of money theory is only truly applicable over the long term. In fact, the assumption of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/longrun.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">long-run</a> money neutrality underlies almost all <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/macroeconomics.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">macroeconomic</a> theory. Mathematical economists rely on this classical dichotomy to predict the effects of economic policy.\n", "\nAn example of the neutrality of money can be seen if a macroeconomist is studying the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monetarypolicy.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">monetary policy</a> of a central bank, such as the\u00a0Federal Reserve (Fed). When the Fed engages in\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/open-market.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">open market</a> operations, the macroeconomist does not assume that changes in the money supply will change future capital equipment, employment levels, or real <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wealth.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">wealth</a> in long-run equilibrium. Those factors will remain constant. This gives the economist a much more stable set of predictive parameters.\n", "\nConceptually, money neutrality grew out of the Cambridge tradition in economics between 1750 and 1870. The earliest version posited that the level of money could not affect output or employment even in the short run. Because the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aggregatesupply.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">aggregate</a> <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/supply-curve.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">supply curve</a> is presumed to be vertical, a change in the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price_level.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">price level</a> does not alter the aggregate output.\n", "\nAdherents believed shifts in the money supply affect all goods and services proportionately and nearly simultaneously. However, many of the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/classicaleconomics.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">classical economists</a> rejected this notion and believed\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortterm.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">short-term</a>\u00a0factors, such as\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price_stickiness.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">price stickiness</a>\u00a0or depressed business confidence, were sources of non-neutrality.\n", "\nThe phrase \u201cneutrality of money\u201d was eventually coined by Austrian economist Friedrich A. Hayek in 1931. Originally, Hayek defined it as a market rate of interest at which malinvestments\u2014poorly allocated business investments according to Austrian <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/business-cycle/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">business cycle</a> theory\u2014did not occur and did not produce business cycles. Later, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/neoclassical.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">neoclassical</a> and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/new-keynesian-economics.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">neo-Keynesian economists</a> adopted the phrase and applied it to their general equilibrium framework, giving it its current meaning.\n", "\nThere is an even stronger version of the neutrality of money postulate: the superneutrality of money. Superneutrality further assumes that changes in the rate of money supply growth do not affect economic output.\u00a0Money growth has no impact on real variables except for real money balances.\u00a0This theory disregards short-run frictions and is pertinent to an economy accustomed to a constant money growth rate.\n", "\nThe<strong> </strong>neutrality of money theory has attracted criticism from some quarters. Many notable economists reject the concept in the short and long run, including <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/john_maynard_keynes.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">John Maynard Keynes</a>, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/ludwig-von-mises.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ludwig von Mises</a>, and Paul Davidson. The post-Keynesian school and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/09/austrian-school-of-economics.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Austrian school of economics</a> also dismiss it. Several <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/econometrics.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">econometric</a> studies suggest that variations in the money supply affect relative prices over long periods of time.\n", "\nThe primary argument states that as the money supply increases, the value of money decreases. Eventually, as the increased supply of money spreads throughout the economy, the prices of goods and services will increase in order to reach a point of equilibrium by counteracting the increase of the money supply.\n", "\nCritics also argue that an increase in the supply of money impacts consumption and production. Because an increase in the supply of money increases prices, this increase in price alters how individuals and businesses interact with the economy.\n"]}
