Since a debit in one account offsets a credit in another, the sum of all debits must equal the sum of all credits. The double-entry system of bookkeeping standardizes the accounting process and improves the accuracy of prepared financial statements, allowing for improved detection of errors.\n", "\nBookkeeping and accounting are ways of measuring, recording, and communicating a firm's financial information. A business transaction is an economic event that is recorded for accounting/bookkeeping purposes. In general terms, it is a business interaction between economic entities, such as customers and businesses or vendors and businesses.\n", "\nUnder the systematic process of accounting, these interactions are generally classified into accounts. There are seven different types of accounts that all business transactions can be classified:\n", "\nBookkeeping and accounting track changes in each account as a company continues operations.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/04/072304.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Debits and credits</a> are essential to the double entry system.\u00a0In accounting, a debit refers to an entry on the left side of an account ledger, and credit refers to an entry on the right side of an account ledger.\u00a0To be in balance, the total of debits and credits for a transaction must be equal.\u00a0Debits do not always equate to increases and credits do not always equate to decreases.\n", "\nA debit may increase one account while decreasing another.\u00a0For example, a debit increases asset accounts but decreases liability and equity accounts, which supports the general accounting equation of Assets = Liabilities + Equity.\u00a0On the income statement, debits increase the balances in expense and loss accounts, while credits decrease their balances.\u00a0Debits decrease revenue and gains account balances, while credits increase their balances.\n", "\nDouble-entry bookkeeping was developed in the mercantile period of Europe to help rationalize commercial transactions and make trade more efficient. It also helped merchants and bankers understand their costs and profits. Some thinkers have argued that double-entry accounting was a key calculative technology responsible for the birth of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalism.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">capitalism</a>.\n", "\nThe accounting equation forms the foundation of the double-entry accounting and is a concise representation of a concept that <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expanded-accounting-equation.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">expands into</a> the complex, expanded and multi-item display of the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancesheet.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">balance sheet</a>.\u00a0The balance sheet is based on the double-entry accounting system where total assets of a company are equal to the total of liabilities and shareholder equity.\n", "\nEssentially, the representation equates all uses of capital (assets) to all sources of capital (where debt capital leads to liabilities and equity capital leads to shareholders' equity). For a company keeping accurate accounts, every single business transaction will be represented in at least of its two accounts.\n", "\nFor instance, if a business takes a loan from a financial entity like a bank, the borrowed money will raise the company's assets and the loan liability will also rise by an equivalent amount. If a business buys raw material by paying cash, it will lead to an increase in the inventory (asset) while reducing cash capital (another asset). Because there are two or more accounts affected by every transaction carried out by a company, the accounting system is referred to as double-entry accounting.\n", "\nThis practice ensures that the accounting equation always remains balanced \u2013 that is, the left side value of the equation will always match with the right side value.\n", "\nA bakery purchases a fleet of refrigerated delivery trucks on credit; the total credit purchase was $250,000.
