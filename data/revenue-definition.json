Revenue is also known as sales, as in the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-to-salesratio.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">price-to-sales ratio</a> - an alternative to the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-earningsratio.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">price-to-earnings ratio</a>\u00a0that uses revenue in the denominator.\n", "\nThere are different ways to calculate revenue, depending on the accounting method employed. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accrualaccounting.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Accrual accounting</a> will include sales made on credit as revenue for goods or services delivered to the customer. It is necessary to check the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashflowstatement.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cash flow statement</a> to assess how efficiently a company collects money owed.\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashaccounting.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cash accounting</a>, on the other hand, will only count sales as revenue when payment is received. Cash paid to a company is known as a \"receipt\". It is possible to have receipts without revenue. For example, if the customer\u00a0paid in advance for a service not yet rendered or undelivered goods, this activity leads to a receipt but not revenue.\n", "\nRevenue is known as the top line because it appears first on a company's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incomestatement.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">income statement</a>. Net income, also known as the bottom line, is revenues minus expenses. There is a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/122214/what-difference-between-revenue-and-profit.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">profit</a> when revenues exceed expenses. To increase profit, and hence <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eps.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">earnings per share</a> for its shareholders, a company increases revenues and/or reduces expenses. Investors often consider a company's revenue and net income separately to determine the health of a business. It is possible for net income to grow while revenues remain stagnant because of cost-cutting. Such a situation does not bode well for a company's long-term growth. When public companies report their <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earningsreport.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">quarterly earnings</a>, the two figures that receive the most attention are revenues and earnings per share (\"<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"5\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/04/050604.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">earnings</a>\" being equivalent to net income). Subsequent price movement in stocks generally correlates to whether a company beat or missed <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"6\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/professionals/092415/career-advice-financial-analyst-vsresearch-analyst.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">analysts'</a> revenue and earnings per share expectations.\n", "\nA company's revenue may be subdivided according to the divisions that generate it. For example, a recreational vehicles department might have a financing division, which could be a separate source of revenue. Revenue can also be divided into <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operating-revenue.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">operating revenue</a> - sales from a company's core business - and non-operating revenue which is derived from secondary sources.\u00a0As these non-operating revenue sources are often unpredictable or nonrecurring, they can be referred to as one-time events or gains. For example, proceeds from the sale of an asset, a windfall from investments, or money awarded through litigation are non-operating revenue.\n", "\nIn the case of government, revenue is the money received from taxation, fees, fines, inter-governmental grants or transfers, securities sales, mineral or resource rights, as well as any sales made.\n", "\nFor non-profits, revenues are its gross receipts. Its components include donations from individuals, foundations, and companies; grants from government entities; investments; fundraising activities; and membership fees.\n", "\nIn terms of real estate investments, revenue refers to the income generated by a property, such as rent, parking fees, on-site laundry costs, etc. When the operating expenses incurred in running the property are subtracted from property income, the resulting value is <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/noi.asp\">net operating income</a>.\n", "\nNo. Revenue is the money a company earns from the sale of its products and services.\u00a0Cash flow is the net amount of cash\u00a0being transferred into and out of a company.\u00a0Revenue provides a measure of the effectiveness of a company's\u00a0sales and marketing, whereas cash flow is more of a\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp\">liquidity</a>\u00a0indicator.\u00a0 Both revenue and cash flow should be analyzed together for a comprehensive review of a company's financial health.\n", "\nFor many companies, revenues are generated from the sales of products or services. For this reason, revenue is sometimes known as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/grosssales.asp\">gross sales</a>.\n", "\nRevenue can also be earned via other sources. Inventors or entertainers may receive revenue from licensing, patents, or royalties. Real estate investors might earn revenue from rental income. Revenue for federal and local governments would likely be in the form of tax receipts from property or income taxes. Governments might also earn revenue from the sale of an asset or interest income from a bond. Charities and non-profit organizations usually receive income from donations and grants. Universities could earn revenue from charging tuition but also from investment gains on their endowment fund.\n", "\nAccrued revenue is the revenue earned by a company for the delivery of goods or services that have yet to be paid by the customer.\u00a0In\u00a0accrual accounting, revenue is reported at the time a sales transaction takes place and may not necessarily represent cash in hand. Deferred, or unearned revenue can be thought of as the opposite of accrued revenue, in that unearned revenue accounts for money prepaid by a customer for goods or services that have yet to be delivered.\u00a0If a company has received\u00a0prepayment for its goods, it would recognize the revenue as unearned, but\u00a0would not recognize the revenue on its income statement until the period for which the goods or services were delivered.\n", "\nYes. A company has a cost to produce goods sold, as well as other fixed costs and obligations like taxes and interest payments due on loans. As a result, if total costs exceed revenues, a company will have a negative profit even though it may be bringing in a lot of money from sales.\n"]}
