Smurfing is an illegal activity that can have serious consequences.\n", "\nCurrent bank regulations require banks or other financial institutions to report cash transactions exceeding $10,000\u2014or any others they deem suspicious\u2014on a\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/suspicious-activity-report.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">suspicious activity report</a> (SAR).\n", "\nSmurfing involves depositing illegally gained money into multiple bank accounts for under-the-radar transfer in the near future.\n", "\nTo prevent money laundering by criminals involved in illegal activities, such as drugs and extortion, countries such as the United States and Canada require a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/ctr.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">currency transaction report</a> to be filed by a financial institution handling any transaction exceeding $10,000 in cash. Therefore, a criminal group with $50,000 in cash for laundering may use several smurfs for depositing anywhere from $5,000 to $9,000 in a number of geographically dispersed accounts. This is a form of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/structured-transaction.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">structuring transactions</a> to avoid regulatory detection.

In the placement stage, the criminal is relieved of guarding large amounts of illegally obtained cash by placing it into the financial system. For example, a smurf may pack cash in a suitcase and smuggle it to another country for gambling, buying international currency, or other reasons.\n", "\nDuring the layering<strong> </strong>stage, illicit money is separated from its source by a sophisticated layering of financial transactions that obscures the audit trail and breaks the link to the original crime. For example, a smurf may move funds electronically from one country to another, then divide the money into investments placed in advanced financial options or overseas markets.\n", "\nThe integration<strong> </strong>stage is when the money is returned to the criminal. Although there are numerous ways of getting the money back, funds must appear to come from a legitimate source, and the process must not draw attention. For example, valuables such as property, artwork, jewelry, or high-end automobiles may be purchased and given to the criminal.\n", "\nOne way criminals move money internationally is known as \u201ccuckoo smurfing.\u201d Suppose that a New York criminal owes a London criminal $9,000, and a London merchant owes a New York supplier $9,000.\n", "\nThe London merchant and the New York supplier do not know the funds were never directly transferred.
