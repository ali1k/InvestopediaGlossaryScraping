The notional amount is denominated in the domestic currency. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp\">Interest rates</a> may be fixed or floating.\n", "\nBecause they depend on the currency <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exchangerate.asp\">exchange rate</a> and differences in interest rates in those currencies, they are also known as differential, rate differential, or just \"diff\" swaps. Another name for these swaps could also be guaranteed exchange rate swap because they naturally embed a fixed currency exchange rate in the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/swap.asp\">swap</a> contract.\n", "\nThough they deal with two different currencies, payments are settled in\u00a0just one. For example, a typical quanto swap would involve a U.S. investor paying six-month <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/libor.asp\">LIBOR</a> in U.S. dollars, for a US$1 million loan, and receive in return, payments in U.S. dollars at the six-month <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/euribor.asp\">EURIBOR</a> + 75 <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/basispoint.asp\">basis points</a>.\n", "\nFixed-for-floating quanto swaps allow an investor to minimize <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreignexchangerisk.asp\">foreign exchange risk</a>. This\u00a0avoidance of\u00a0risk\u00a0is achieved by fixing both the exchange rate and interest rate at the same time.\n", "\nFloating-for-floating swaps have a slightly higher risk. In this\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cross-currency-swap.asp\">cross-currency swap</a>, exposure of each party to the spread of each country's currency interest rate happens.\n", "\nInvestors will use quanto swaps when they believe that a particular asset will do well in\u00a0a\u00a0country, but at the same time, fear that the country's currency will not perform as well.\u00a0Thus, the investor will swap the interest rates with another investor while keeping the payout in their home currency. In this way, they can\u00a0separate <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestraterisk.asp\">interest rate risk</a> from exchange rate risk.\n", "\nIn a typical <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrateswap.asp\">interest rate swap</a>,\u00a0two agreeable counterparties exchange one stream of future interest payments for another, which has a basis of a specific <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/principal.asp\">principal</a> amount. These swaps require the exchange of a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixedinterestrate.asp\">fixed interest rate</a> value for a floating rate value. The swap may be either direction but is built to reduce or to increase exposure to the changes in interest rates. An interest rate swap may also help obtain a marginally lower interest rate than would have been possible without the swap.\n", "\nHowever, for an investor in a different country wishing to engage in a swap in the U.S. market, they first would have to exchange their asset from their home currency into U.S. dollars. Each payment is made in U.S. dollars, which the foreign investor must then\u00a0transfer back into their home <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currency.asp\">currency</a>.\n", "\nThis strategy\u00a0will involve potential interest rate risk, depending on whether the foreign investor receives <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/floatinginterestrate.asp\">floating rate</a> payments. It also creates a foreign exchange, or currency risk. A quanto swap solves this problem because all future exchange rates are fixed at the time of the swap contract writing.\n"]}
