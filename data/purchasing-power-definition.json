Purchasing power is important because, all else being equal, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp\">inflation</a> decreases the number of goods or services you would be able to purchase.\n", "\nIn investment terms, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/buyingpower.asp\">purchasing power</a> is the dollar amount of credit available to a customer to buy additional securities against the existing <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marginable.asp\">marginable securities</a> in the brokerage account. Purchasing power may also be known as a currency's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/buyingpower.asp\">buying power</a>.\n", "\nInflation reduces the value of a currency's purchasing power, having the effect of an increase in prices. To measure purchasing power in the traditional economic sense, you would compare the price of a good or service against a price index such as the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumerpriceindex.asp\">Consumer Price Index (CPI)</a>. One way to think about purchasing power is to imagine if you made the same salary as your grandfather 40 years ago. Today you would need a much greater salary just to maintain the same quality of living. By the same token, a homebuyer looking for homes 10 years ago in the $300,000 to 350,000 price range had more options to consider than people have now.\n", "\nPurchasing power affects every aspect of economics, from consumers buying goods\u00a0to investors and stock prices\u00a0to a country\u2019s economic prosperity. When a currency\u2019s purchasing power decreases due to excessive inflation, serious negative economic consequences arise, including rising costs of goods and services contributing to a high <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cost-of-living.asp\">cost of living</a>, as well as high interest rates that affect the global market, and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditrating.asp\">falling credit ratings</a> as a result. All of these factors can contribute to an economic crisis.\n", "\nAs such, a country\u2019s government institutes policies and regulations to protect a currency\u2019s purchasing power and keep an economy healthy. One method to monitor purchasing power is through the Consumer Price Index. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bls.asp\">The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)</a>\u00a0measures the weighted average of prices of consumer goods and services, in particular, transportation, food, and medical care.

PPP is an economic theory that estimates the amount that needs to be adjusted to the price of an item, given two countries\u2019 exchange rates, in order for the exchange to match each currency\u2019s purchasing power. PPP can be used to compare countries\u2019 income levels and other relevant economic data concerning the cost of living, or possible rates of inflation and deflation.\n", "\nHistorical examples of severe inflation and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hyperinflation.asp\">hyperinflation</a>\u2014or the destruction of a currency\u2019s purchasing power\u2014have shown there are several causes of such a phenomenon. Often expensive, devastating wars will cause an economic collapse, in particular for\u00a0the losing country, such as Germany during World War I (WWI).\n", "\nIn the aftermath of WWI during the 1920s, Germany experienced extreme economic hardship and almost unprecedented hyperinflation, due in part to the enormous amount of reparations Germany had to pay. Unable to pay these reparations with the suspect German mark, Germany printed paper notes to buy foreign currencies, resulting in high inflation rates that rendered the German mark valueless with a nonexistent purchasing power.\n", "\nToday, the effects of the loss of purchasing power are still felt in the aftermath of the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/09/financial-crisis-review.asp\">2008 global financial crisis</a> and the European sovereign debt crisis. With increased <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/globalization.asp\">globalization</a> and the introduction of the euro, currencies are even more inextricably linked.

Quantitative easing, initially controversial, essentially saw the U.S. Federal Reserve buy government and other market securities to lower interest rates and increase the money supply. The idea is that a market will then experience an increase in capital, which spurs increased lending and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp\">liquidity</a>. The U.S. stopped its policy of quantitative easing once the economy stabilized, due in part to the above policy and a multitude of other complex factors.\n", "\nThe <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/europeancentralbank.asp\">European Central Bank (ECB)</a>\u00a0also pursued quantitative easing to help stop deflation in the eurozone after the European sovereign debt crisis and bolster the euro's purchasing power. The <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/emu.asp\">European Economic and Monetary Union</a> has also established strict regulations in the eurozone on accurately reporting sovereign debt, inflation, and other financial data. As a general rule, countries attempt to keep inflation fixed at a rate of 2 percent\u00a0as moderate levels of inflation are acceptable, with high levels of deflation leading to economic stagnation.\n", "\nPurchasing power loss/gain is an increase or decrease in how much consumers can buy with a given amount of money. Consumers lose purchasing power when prices increase and gain purchasing power when prices decrease.

In the absence of inflation, $1,000 will now buy a laptop plus an additional $500 worth of goods.\n", "\nRetirees must be particularly aware of purchasing power loss since they are living off of a fixed amount of money.

With all other things being equal, inflation decreases the number of goods or services you would be able to purchase with the same amount of money, meaning that investors must look for ways to actively make a return higher than the current rate of inflation.
