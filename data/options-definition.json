Options are divided into call options, which allow buyers to profit if the price of the stock increases; and put options, in which the buyer profits if the price of the stock declines. Like with other securities, investors can also go \u201cshort\u201d an option by selling them to other investors. Shorting (or \u201cselling\u201d) a call option would therefore mean profiting if the underlying stock declines, while selling a put option would mean profiting if the stock increases in value.\n", "\nOptions can be very useful as a source of leverage and risk hedging. For example, an investor who is bullish on the prospects of a company and wishes to invest $1,000 could potentially earn a far greater return by purchasing $1,000 worth of call options on that company, as compared to buying $1,000 of that company\u2019s shares. In this sense, the call options provide the investor with a way to leverage their position by increasing their buying power. On the other hand, if that same investor already had exposure to that same company and wanted to reduce that exposure, they could hedge their risk by selling put options against that company.\n", "\nThe main disadvantage of options contracts is that they are complex and difficult to price. For this reason, options have historically been considered an \u201cadvanced\u201d type of investment vehicle, suitable only for experienced professional investors. In recent years, however, they have become increasingly popular among retail investors. Because of their capacity for outsized returns or losses, investors should make sure that they fully understand the potential implications before entering in to any options positions. Failing to do so can lead to devastating losses.\n"]}
