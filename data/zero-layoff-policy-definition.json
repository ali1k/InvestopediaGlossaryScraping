Such a policy is seen by some as a throwback to times of greater paternalism among employers.\u00a0Having a zero layoff policy has a positive effect on employee morale, especially during rough economic times, as employees do not have to fear being unemployed. Companies that employ zero layoff policies frequently find themselves in lists of top places to work.\n", "\nA zero layoff policy is especially evident in recessionary times when most companies will cut headcount in order to improve their financial position.\u00a0Companies that employ a zero layoff policy tend to treat employees like investments. They hire carefully and tend to train their employees to cover a variety of jobs.\n", "\nAs of the third quarter of 2020, the following\u00a0companies have never laid off an employee. Some have been able to maintain a zero layoff policy due to steady growth and lean operating principles, as well as engendering a sense of teamwork among employees that makes occasional belt-tightening more palatable. However, as the impact of COVID-19 drags on, some of the companies have warned that layoffs may end up happening.\n"]}
