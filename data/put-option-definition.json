This pre-determined price that buyer of the put option can sell at is called the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strikeprice.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">strike price</a>.\n", "\nPut options are traded on various underlying assets, including stocks, currencies, bonds, commodities, futures, and indexes. A put option can be contrasted with a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">call option</a>, which gives the holder the right to buy the underlying at a specified price, either on or before the expiration date of the options contract.\n", "\nA put option becomes more valuable as the price of the underlying stock decreases. Conversely, a put option loses its value as the underlying stock increases. When they are exercised, put options provide a short position in the underlying asset. Because of this, they are typically used for hedging purposes or to speculate on downside price action.\n", "\nInvestors often use put options in a risk-management strategy known as a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/protective-put.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">protective put</a>. This strategy is used as a form of investment insurance; this strategy is used to ensure that losses in the underlying asset do not exceed a certain amount (namely, the strike price).\n", "\nIn general, the value of a put option decreases as its time to expiration approaches because of the impact of time decay. Time decay accelerates as an\u00a0option's time\u00a0to expiration draws closer since there's less\u00a0time\u00a0to realize a profit from the trade. When an option loses its time value, the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intrinsicvalue.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">intrinsic value</a> is left over. An option's intrinsic value is equivalent to the difference between the strike price and the underlying stock price. If an option has intrinsic value, it is referred to as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inthemoney.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">in the money (ITM)</a>.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outofthemoney.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Out of the money (OTM)</a> and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/atthemoney.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">at the money (ATM)</a> put options have no intrinsic value\u00a0because there is no benefit in exercising the option. Investors have the option of short selling the stock at the current higher market price, rather than exercising an out of the money put option at an undesirable strike price. However, outside of a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearmarket.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bear</a> market, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/092613/difference-between-short-selling-and-put-options.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">short selling is typically riskier than buying options</a>.\n", "\nTime value, or extrinsic value, is reflected in the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/premium.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">premium</a> of the option. If the strike price of a put option is $20, and the underlying is stock is currently trading at $19, there is $1 of intrinsic value in the option. But the put option may trade for $1.35. The extra $0.35 is time value, since the underlying stock price could change before the option expires. Different put options on the same underlying asset may be combined to form <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/021814/what-bull-put-spread.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">put spreads</a>.\n", "\nThere are several factors to keep in mind when it comes to selling put options. It's important to understand an option contract's value and profitability when considering a trade, or else you risk the stock falling past the point of profitability.\n", "\nThe payoff of a put option at expiration is depicted in the image below:\n", "\nPut options, as well as many other types of options, are traded through brokerages. Some brokers have specialized features and benefits for options traders.

It's important to identify a broker that is a good match for your investment needs.\n", "\nThe put option seller, known as the option writer, does not need to hold an option until expiration (and neither does the option buyer). As the underlying stock price moves, the premium of the option will change\u00a0to reflect the recent underlying price movements. The option buyer can sell their option and, either minimize loss or realize a profit, depending on how the price of the option has changed since they bought it.\n", "\nSimilarly, the option writer can do the same thing. If the underlying's price is above the strike price, they may do nothing. This is because the option may expire at no value, and this allows them to keep the whole premium. But if the underlying's price is approaching or dropping below the strike price\u2013to avoid a big loss\u2013the option writer may simply buy the option back (which gets them out of the position). The profit or loss is the difference between the premium collected and the premium that is paid in order to get out of the position.\n", "\nAssume an investor owns one put option on the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY)\u2014and assume it is currently trading at $277.00\u2014with a strike price of $260 expiring in one month. For this option, they paid a premium of $0.72, or $72 ($0.72 x 100 shares).\n", "\nThe investor has the right to sell 100 shares of XYZ\u00a0at a price of $260 until the expiration date in one month, which is usually the third Friday of the month, although it can be weekly.\n", "\nIf shares of SPY fall to $250\u00a0and the investor <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exercise.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">exercises</a> the option, the investor could establish a short sell position in SPY, as if it were initiated from a price of $260 per share. Alternatively, the investor could purchase 100 shares of SPY\u00a0for $250\u00a0in the market and sell the shares to the option's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/writing-an-option.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">writer</a> for $260 each. Consequently, the investor would make $1,000 (100 x ($260-$250)) on the put option, less the $72 cost they paid for the option. Net profit is $1,000 - $72 = $928, less any commission costs.\u00a0The maximum loss on the trade is limited to the premium paid, or $72. The maximum profit is attained if SPY falls to $0.\n", "\nContrary to a long put option, a short or written put option obligates an investor to take delivery, or purchase shares, of the underlying stock.\n", "\nAssume an investor is bullish on SPY, which is currently trading at $277, and does not believe it will fall below $260\u00a0over the next two months. The investor could collect a premium of $0.72\u00a0(x 100 shares) by writing one put option on SPY with a strike price of $260.\n", "\nThe option writer would collect a total of $72 ($0.72\u00a0x\u00a0100). If SPY stays\u00a0above the $260\u00a0strike price, the investor would keep the premium collected since the options would expire out of the money and be worthless. This is the maximum profit on the trade: $72, or the premium collected.\n", "\nConversely, if SPY moves\u00a0below $260, the investor is on the hook for purchasing 100 shares at $260, even if the stock falls to $250, or $200, or lower. No matter how far the stock falls, the put option writer is liable for purchasing shares at $260, meaning they face a theoretical risk of $260 per share, or $26,000 per contract ($260 x 100 shares) if the underlying stock falls to zero.\n"]}
