These methods can range from dialogue with managers to formal proposals, which are voted on by all shareholders at a company's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/agm.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">annual meeting</a>.\n", "\nShareholder activists also employ a variety of offensive tactics to force changes. For example, they might make strategic use of media channels in order to publicize their demands and prompt greater pressure from other shareholders. They may also threaten companies with lawsuits if they are not allowed to have their say.\n", "\nSome of the issues addressed by shareholder activists are for social change,\u00a0requiring <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/divestment.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">divestment</a>\u00a0from politically sensitive parts of the world, for example, greater support of workers' rights (sweatshops)\u00a0and/or more accountability for environmental degradation.\n", "\nBut\u00a0the term can also refer to investors\u00a0who believe that a company's management is doing a poor job. This class of activist investors often attempts to gain control of the company and replace management or force a major corporate change.\n", "\nOver the years, shareholder activism has increased in total capital deployed as well as the number of campaigns mounted. According to the Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance, 2018 was a record year for shareholder activists. Approximately $65 billion in capital was deployed throughout the year, with an increase in initiated campaigns to 250, and an increase in the number of investors from 110 in 2017 to 130 in 2018.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nThese figures represent a \"modest\" increase in figures from the previous year, another one for the record books. Shareholder activists are also reaching out across borders to conduct campaigns.

Along with Texaco and American Airlines, TWA was one of the nation\u2019s largest airlines at the time.
