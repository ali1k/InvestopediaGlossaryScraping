The court order cannot force a retirement plan to disburse any benefit or option that is not provided through the plan. The QDRO cannot require increased benefits from the retirement plan. Benefits cannot be required from a plan for an alternate payee when those benefits are already required to be covered by another payee who is under the decree of another QDRO. A benefits plan cannot be required to cover benefits that are a qualified joint and survivor annuity for the ex-spouse and any later spouses.\n", "\nIn some cases, a QDRO might be put in place for a relation other than a former spouse. Dependents might qualify to receive the ordered benefits. In such instances, the alternate payee is a minor or is determined to be legally incompetent. The order can require the benefit plan to make payment to an individual with legal responsibility for that payee. This can include a guardian as well as a trustee who serves as the agent of the individual.\n", "\nThe <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/plan_administrator.asp\">plan administrator</a> who oversees the retirement benefits subject to the order will determine if a QDRO is a qualified domestic relations order. In these circumstances, plan administrators are then responsible for ensuring their duties are fulfilled on behalf of plan participants and beneficiaries.\n"]}
