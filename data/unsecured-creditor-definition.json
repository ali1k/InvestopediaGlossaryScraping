This poses a higher risk to the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditor.asp\">creditor</a> because it will have nothing to fall back on should the borrower default on the loan.\u00a0If a borrower fails to make a payment on a debt that is unsecured, the creditor cannot take any of the borrower's assets\u00a0without winning a lawsuit first.\n", "\nA debenture holder is an unsecured creditor.\n", "\nIt's uncommon for individuals to be able to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/collateral/\">borrow money without collateral</a>. For example, when you take out a mortgage, a bank will always hold your house as collateral for the loan in case you default. If you take out a loan on an automobile, the lender will secure their debt with your car until it's fully paid off.\n", "\nOne exception wherein money is borrowed without collateral is large corporations, which often issue unsecured commercial paper.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/secured-creditor.asp\">Secured creditors</a> may repossess assets\u00a0as\u00a0payment for a debt using the borrower's collateral. Since the borrower has more to lose by defaulting on a secured loan, and the lender has an asset to gain, this type of debt carries less risk for the lender. As a result, secured debt generally\u00a0comes with lower interest rates when compared to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unsecureddebt.asp\">unsecured debt</a>.\n", "\nMeanwhile,\u00a0repayment to unsecured creditors is\u00a0generally dependent\u00a0on bankruptcy proceedings or successful litigation. An unsecured\u00a0creditor must first file a legal complaint in\u00a0court and obtain a judgment\u00a0before proceeding with collection through wage garnishment\u00a0and other types of liquidated borrower-owned assets.\n", "\nOften, a creditor will first attempt to\u00a0obtain payment through direct contact\u00a0and\u00a0report the outstanding debt to the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditbureau.asp\">major credit bureaus</a>\u2014Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion\u2014before seeking to bring the matter to court. The creditor may also choose to\u00a0sell\u00a0the unpaid debt to a collection agency.\n", "\nDue to the high risk to the lender, unsecured debt often comes with higher interest rates, placing a higher financial burden on the\u00a0borrower.\n", "\nSome of the most common types of unsecured creditors include\u00a0credit card companies, utilities, landlords,\u00a0hospitals and doctor's offices, and lenders that issue\u00a0personal\u00a0or student loans (though education loans carry a special exception that prevents them from being discharged).\n", "\nDefaulting on unsecured debt can negatively affect the borrower's creditworthiness, making\u00a0it much less likely that an unsecured creditor will extend them\u00a0credit in the future.\n"]}
