Asset classes are made up of instruments which often behave similarly to one another in the marketplace.\n", "\nSimply put, an asset class is a grouping of comparable financial securities. For example, IBM, MSFT, AAPL are a grouping of stocks. Asset classes and asset class categories are often mixed together. There is usually very little correlation, and in some cases a negative correlation, between different asset classes. This characteristic is integral to the field of investing.\n", "\nHistorically, the three main <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp\">asset</a> classes have been <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equity.asp\">equities</a> (stocks), fixed income (bonds), and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashequivalents.asp\">cash equivalent</a> or money market instruments.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\"></span> Currently, most investment professionals include <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/intro-to-investment-real-estate/\">real estate</a>,\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"5\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commodity.asp\">commodities</a>, futures, other financial derivatives, and even cryptocurrencies to the asset class mix.

Investment strategies can be tied to growth, value, income or a variety of other factors that help to identify and categorize investment options according to a specific set of criteria. Some analysts link criteria to performance and/or valuation metrics such as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eps.asp\">earnings-per-share</a> growth (EPS) or the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-earningsratio.asp\">price-to-earnings</a> (P/E) ratio. Other analysts are less concerned with performance and more concerned with the asset type or class. An investment in a particular asset class is an investment in an asset that exhibits a certain set of characteristics. As a result, investments in the same asset class tend to have similar cash flows.\n", "\nEquities (stocks), bonds (fixed-income securities), cash or marketable securities, and commodities are the most liquid asset classes and, therefore, the most quoted asset classes. There are also alternative asset classes, such as real estate, and valuable inventory, such as\u00a0artwork, stamps and other tradable collectibles. Some analysts also refer to an investment in hedge funds, venture capital,\u00a0crowdsourcing\u00a0or cryptocurrencies as examples of alternative investments.\u00a0That said, an asset's illiquidity does not speak to its return potential; It only means it may take more time to find a buyer to convert the asset to cash.\n", "\nHistorically, the three main asset classes have been equities (stocks), fixed income (bonds), and cash equivalent or money market instruments.

In other words, one hundred dollars invested in the S&amp;P 500 in January 01, 1920 would have been worth about $167,983 (in 1920 dollars) by December 31, 2020. Without adjusting for inflation the annual rate of return would be 10.46% and the total would have grown to a whopping $2.3 million. By comparison, the same $100 invested in 10-year Treasuries would have been worth only a little more than $8,000.\n", "\nFinancial advisors focus on asset class as a way to help investors diversify their portfolio to maximize returns.
