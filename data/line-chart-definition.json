This is the most basic type of chart used in finance and typically only depicts a security's closing prices over time. Line charts can be used on any timeframe, but most often using day-to-day price changes.\n", "\nA line chart gives traders a clear visualization of where the price of a security has traveled over a given time period. Because line charts only show closing prices, they reduce noise from less critical times in the trading day, such as the open, high, and low. Since <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/closingprice.asp\">closing prices</a> are typically the most commonly viewed piece of data, it is understandable to see why line charts are popular with investors and traders.\n", "\nOther popular styles of charts include <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/barchart.asp\">bar charts</a>, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/candlestick.asp\">candlestick charts</a>, and <a class=\"pseudoStyle\" data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pointandfigurechart.asp\">point and figure</a> charts. Traders can use line charts with other charts to help see the full technical picture.\u00a0\n", "\n<strong>Clarity</strong>: Traders can be overwhelmed with too much information when analyzing a security\u2019s chart. The trading term \u201c<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/analysisparalysis.asp\">paralysis by analysis</a>\u201d\u00a0describes this phenomenon well. Using charts that show a plethora of price information and indicators can give multiple signals that lead to confusion and complicate trading decisions. Using a line chart helps traders clearly identify key <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/trading/support-and-resistance-basics/\">support and resistance</a> levels,\u00a0trends,\u00a0and recognizable chart patterns. For example, the line chart below makes it easy to locate major support and resistance levels between $2.10 and $2.70 before the price drops below support.\n", "\n<strong>Easy-to-Use</strong>: Line charts are ideal for beginner traders to use due to their simplicity. They help to teach basic chart reading skills before learning more advanced techniques, such as reading Japanese <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/trading/candlestick-charting-what-is-it/\">candlestick</a> patterns or learning the basics of point and figure charts. Volume and moving averages can easily be applied to a line chart as traders continue their learning journey.\n", "\nLine charts may not provide enough price information for some traders to monitor their trading strategies. Some\u00a0strategies require prices derived from the open, high, and low. For example, a trader may buy a stock if it closes above the high price of the previous 20 days. Also, traders who use more information than just the close\u00a0do not have enough information to back-test their <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/10/create-trading-strategies.asp\">trading strategy</a> by using a simple line chart. Candlestick charts, which contain an asset's daily open, close, high, and low prices all in the same unit may be more useful in these cases.\n"]}
