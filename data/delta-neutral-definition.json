Investors who want to maintain delta neutrality must adjust their portfolio holdings accordingly. Options traders use delta-neutral strategies to profit either from <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/iv.asp\">implied volatility</a> or from time decay of the options.

The underlying asset, typically a stock position, always has a delta of 1 if the position is a long position and -1 if the position is a short position.
