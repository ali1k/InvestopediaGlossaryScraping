The original offer then functions as a floor for possible better offers. The duration of a go-shop period is usually about one to two months.\u00a0\n", "\nA go-shop period is meant to help a board of directors fulfill its <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiduciary.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fiduciary</a> duty to shareholders and find the best deal possible. Go-shop agreements usually give the initial bidder the opportunity to match any better offer the target company receives. They also pay the initial bidder a reduced <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/breakfee.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">breakup fee</a> if the target company is purchased by another suitor.\n", "\nIn an active <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mergersandacquisitions.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mergers and acquisitions</a> (M&amp;A) environment, it may be reasonable to believe that other bidders may come forward. However, critics say go-shop periods are cosmetic, designed to give the board of directors the appearance of acting in the best interests of shareholders. Critics note that go-shop periods rarely result in additional offers, because they don't give other potential buyers enough time to perform due diligence on the target company. Historical data suggests a very small fraction of initial bids are cast aside in favor of new bids during go-shop periods.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nA go-shop period allows the company being acquired to shop around for a better offer.

However, companies can respond to unsolicited offers as part of their fiduciary duty. The status quo in many M&amp;A deals is to have a no-shop provision.\u00a0\n", "\nA go-shop period generally appears when the selling company is private and the buyer is an investment firm, such as private equity.
