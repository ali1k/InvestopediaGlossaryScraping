At its root, any economic theory is a methodology that is adopted as a means of directing the distribution of a finite amount of resources in a way that is beneficial for the greatest number of individuals.\n", "\nIn a wider sense, political economy was once the common term used for the field we now call <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economics.asp\">economics</a>. Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau all used the term to describe their theories. The briefer term economy was substituted in the early 20th century with the development of more rigorous statistical methods for analyzing economic factors.\n", "\nThe term political economy is still widely used to describe any government policy that has an economic impact.\n", "\nPolitical economy is a branch of social science that studies the relationship that forms between a nation's population and its government when public policy is enacted. It is, therefore, the result of the interaction between politics and the economy and is the basis of the social science discipline.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nAs mentioned above, there are several notable types of political economies:\n", "\nThose who research the political economy are called political economists. Their study generally involves the examination of how public policy, the political situation, and political institutions impact a country's economic standing and future through a sociological, political, and economic lens.\n", "\nThe roots of political economy as we know it today go back to the 18th century. Scholars during the period studied how wealth was distributed and administered between people. Some of the earlier works that examined this phenomenon included those by <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/updates/adam-smith-economics/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Adam Smith</a> and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/john-stuart-mill.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">John Stuart Mill</a>.\n", "\nBut the term is probably best ascribed to the French writer and economist, Antoine de Montchrestien. He wrote a book called \"Trait\u00e9 de l'\u00e9conomie politique\" in 1615, in which he examined the need for production and wealth to be distributed on an entirely larger scale\u2014not in the household as Aristotle suggested. The book also analyzed how economics and politics are interrelated.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"8\"></span>\n", "\nSmith was a philosopher, economist, and writer who is commonly referred to as the father of economics and of the political economy. He wrote about the function of a self-regulating free market in his first book, which was called \"The Theory of Moral Sentiments.\"<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"5\"></span> His most famous work, \"An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations\" (or \"<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/updates/adam-smith-wealth-of-nations/\">The Wealth of Nations</a>\") helped shape classical economic theory. It was also used as the foundation for future economists.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"6\"></span>\n", "\nMill combined economics with philosophy. He believed in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/utilitarianism.asp\">utilitarianism</a>\u2014that actions that lead to people's goodwill are right and that those that lead to suffering are wrong.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"7\"></span> In essence, he believed that economic theory and philosophy were needed, along with social awareness in politics in order to make better decisions for the good of the people. Some of his work, including \"Principles of Political Economy,\" \"Utilitarianism,\" and A System of Logic\" led him to become one of the most important figures in politics and economics.\n", "\nPolitical economy became an academic discipline of its own in recent years. Many major institutions offer the study as part of their political science, economics, and/or sociology departments.\n", "\nResearch by political economists is conducted in order to determine how public policy influences behavior, productivity, and trade. Much of their study helps them establish how money and power are distributed between people and different groups.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\"></span> They may do this through the study of specific fields such as law, bureaucratic politics, legislative behavior, the intersection of government and business, and regulation.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\"></span>\n", "\nThe study may be approached in any of three ways:\n", "\nModern applications of the political economy study the works of more contemporary philosophers and economists, such as Karl Marx.\n", "\nAs mentioned above, Marx became disenchanted with capitalism as a whole. He believed that individuals suffered under regimented social classes, where one or more individuals controlled the greater proportion of wealth. Under communist theories, this would be eradicated, allowing everyone to live equally while the economy functions based on the ability and needs of each participant. Under communist regimes, resources are controlled and distributed by the government.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"11\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff\n", "\nMost people confuse socialism and communism. It's true there are some similarities\u2014notably, that both stress bridging the gap between rich and poor, and that society should relegate equilibrium among all citizens. But there are inherent differences between the two. While resources in a communist society are owned and controlled by the government, individuals in a socialist society hold property. People can still purchase goods and services under socialism, while those who live in a communist society are provided with their basic necessities by the government.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"9\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff\n", "\nThe term political economy refers to a branch of social sciences that focuses on relationships between individuals, governments, and public policy. It is also used to describe the policies set by governments that affect their nations' economies.\n", "\nThe main concern of political economy is to determine the relationship between governments and individuals, and how public policy affects society. This is done through the study of sociology, politics, and economics.\n", "\nSome of the characteristics or themes of a political economy include the distribution of wealth, how goods and services are produced, who owns property and other resources, who profits from production, supply and demand, and how public policy and government interaction impact society.\n", "\nThe types of a political economy include socialism (which states that any production and wealth should be regulated and distributed by society), capitalism (where private owners control a nation's industry and trade for profit), and communism (the theory where all property is publicly-owned and everyone works based on their own needs and strengths).\n", "\nAdam Smith is generally considered the father of economics and the father of the political economy. But the term is generally ascribed to French economist Antoine de Montchrestien, who wrote the book \"Trait\u00e9 de l'\u00e9conomie politique,\" which translates to the treaty of the political economy.\n"]}
