The <a class=\"CMY_Link CMY_Valid\" data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/grantor.asp\">grantor</a> is the person transferring the property, and each grantor must sign the deed. A grant deed contains the name of the person or entity transferring the property (the grantor); the legal description of the property being transferred (i.e., lot number, tract number, city, county, and state); and the name of the person or entity that the property is being transferred to (the grantee). The grant deed shows that the title has not already been granted to another person.\n", "\nThe grant deed\u00a0is written proof that an individual owns a property. The grant deed also provides title guarantees to the new owner \u2014 insurance that the property title is free of claims or liens and the new\u00a0owner has the right to sell or transfer the property to another.\n", "\nThere are numerous types of grant depending on who is transferring property to whom. For example, an interspousal transfer grant deed is used to transfer ownership of real property from one spouse to another (often during a divorce). Real property consists of land and any property attached directly to it (such as buildings, ponds, canals, roads, and machinery) and can also entail the right to use, control, and dispose of the land.\n", "\nA property that is transferred with a grant deed does not need to be reassessed for property tax purposes. A <a class=\"CMY_Link CMY_Valid\" data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/notary.asp\">notary</a> usually witnesses the actual signing of a grant deed, and the grantee usually pays a small fee to record the deed with the county government.\n", "\nReal estate, including real property, is often described as an asset class along with stocks, bonds, cash, and alternative investments like private equity and venture capital. Grant deeds often help in the transfer of real estate from one owner to another.\n", "\nReal estate sales are unique in that the natural surroundings and immediate geographic area of properties significantly impact prices. For example, residential real estate values are affected by local factors such as the area's employment rate, economy, crime rates, transportation facilities, quality of schools and other municipal services, along with property taxes.\n", "\nIn commercial real estate, which is often more valuable per square foot than residential real estate, these factors are also pertinent although less so. Commercial rental real estate is more heavily regulated than residential real estate with specific regulations existing between countries, states, and even cities and counties. Zoning regulations can add a further layer of complexity to commercial real estate investments along with the risk of tenant turnover.\n", "\nThose interested can Invest directly in real estate (where grant deeds would come into play) or indirectly by buying shares in <a class=\"CMY_Link CMY_Valid\" data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reit.asp\">real estate investment trusts</a> (REITs) or mortgage-backed securities (MBS).\n"]}
