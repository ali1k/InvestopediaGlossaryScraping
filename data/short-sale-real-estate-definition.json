The buyer of the property is a third party (not the bank), and all proceeds from the sale go to the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lender.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lender</a>.

In some states, this difference must legally be forgiven in a short sale.\n", "\nThe term \u201cshort sale\u201d\u00a0refers to the fact that the home is being sold for less than the balance remaining on the mortgage\u2014for example, a person selling a home for $150,000 when there is still $175,000 remaining on the mortgage.\u00a0In this example, the difference of $25,000, minus <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/closingcosts.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">closing costs</a>, and other <a class=\"pseudoStyle\" data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/transactioncosts.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">costs of selling</a>, is considered the deficiency. Or, $150,000 - $175,000 = -$25,000.\n", "\nBefore the process can begin, the lender holding the mortgage must sign off on the decision to execute a short sale, also known as a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pre-foreclosure.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pre-foreclosure</a> sale. Additionally, the lender, typically a bank, needs documentation that explains why a short sale makes sense; after all, the lending institution could lose a lot of money in the process. No short sale may occur without lender approval.\n", "\nShort sales tend to be lengthy and paperwork-intensive transactions, sometimes taking up to a full year to process. However, short sales are not as detrimental to a homeowner\u2019s <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditrating.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">credit rating</a> as a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreclosure.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">foreclosure</a>.\n", "\nA real estate short sale is unlike a short sale in investing. An investing <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortsale.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">short sale</a> is a transaction in which an investor sells borrowed securities in anticipation of a price decline and is required to return an equal number of shares at some point in the future.\n", "\nEven though a short sale hurts a person\u2019s <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit_score.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">credit score</a> less than a foreclosure, it is still a negative credit mark.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff Any type of property sale that is denoted by a credit company as \u201cnot paid as agreed\u201d is a ding on a credit score. Therefore, short sales, foreclosures, and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deed_in_lieu_of_foreclosure.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure</a> all negatively impact a person\u2019s credit.\n", "\nWhat's more, short sales don\u2019t always negate the remaining mortgage debt after a property is sold. This is because there are two parts to all mortgages: a promise to repay the lender and a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lien.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lien</a> against the property used to secure the loan. The lien protects the lender in case a borrower can\u2019t repay the loan. It gives the lending institution the right to sell the property for repayment. This part of the mortgage is waived in a short sale.\n", "\nThe second part of the mortgage is the promise to repay, and lenders can still enforce this portion, either through a new note or the collection of the deficiency. Whatever happens, lending institutions must approve the short sale, and borrowers are sometimes at their whim.\n", "\nShort sales and foreclosures are two financial options available to homeowners who are behind on their mortgage payments, who have a home that is <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underwater-mortgage.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">underwater</a>, or both. In both cases, the owner is forced to part with the home, but the timeline and consequences are different.\n", "\nA foreclosure is the act of the lender seizing the home after the borrower fails to make payments. Foreclosure is the last option for the lender. Unlike a short sale, foreclosures are initiated by lenders only. The lender moves against the delinquent borrower to force the sale of a home, hoping to make good on its initial investment of the mortgage. Also, unlike most short sales, many foreclosures take place when the homeowner has abandoned the home. If the occupants have not yet left the home, they are evicted by the lender in the foreclosure process.\n", "\nOnce the lender has access to the home, it orders an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/appraisal.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">appraisal</a> and proceeds with trying to sell it. Foreclosures do not normally take as long to complete as a short sale,\u00a0because the lender is concerned with <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidate.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">liquidating</a> the asset quickly. Foreclosed homes may also be auctioned off at a trustee sale, where buyers bid on homes in a public process.\n", "\nA homeowner who has gone through a short sale may, with certain restrictions, be eligible to purchase another home immediately. Depending on the circumstances, homeowners who experience foreclosure can expect to wait two to seven years to purchase another home. A foreclosure is kept on a person\u2019s <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditreport.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">credit report</a> for seven years.\n", "\nWhile a foreclosure essentially lets you walk away from your home\u2014albeit with grave consequences for your financial future, such as having to declare bankruptcy and destroying your credit\u2014completing a short sale is labor-intensive. However, the payoff for the extra work involved in a short sale may be worth it.\n", "\nBefore resigning yourself to a short sale, talk to your lender about the possibility of a revised payment plan or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/loan_modification.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">loan modification</a>. One of these options might allow you to stay in your home and get back on your feet.\n", "\nAnother possible option for staying in your home arises if you have <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/insurance/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">private mortgage insurance</a> (PMI). Many homeowners who purchased homes with less than 20% down were required to purchase PMI with their homes. If the PMI company thinks you have a chance at recovering from your current financial situation, it may advance funds to your lender to bring your payments up to date. Eventually, you\u2019ll have to repay the advance.\n", "\nBefore beginning the short-sale process, the struggling homeowner should consider how likely it is that the lender will want to work with them on a short sale by understanding the lender\u2019s perspective. The lender is not required to do a short sale; it will be allowed at the lender\u2019s discretion.\n", "\nThe source of the financial trouble should be new\u2014such as a health problem, the loss of a job, or a divorce\u2014not something that was not disclosed when the homebuyer originally applied for the loan. The lender won\u2019t be sympathetic to a dishonest borrower. However, if you feel you were a victim of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/predatory_lending.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">predatory lending</a> practices, you may be able to talk the lender into a short sale even if you have not had any major financial catastrophes since purchasing the home.\n", "\nTo put yourself in a more convincing position to complete a short sale, stop purchasing non-necessities. You don\u2019t want to look irresponsible to the lender when it reviews your short-sale proposal.\n", "\nAlso, be aware of other circumstances that may prevent the lender from wanting to do a short sale. If you are not in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/default2.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">default</a> on your mortgage payments yet, the lender probably won\u2019t be willing to work with you. If the lender thinks it can get more money from foreclosing on your home than from allowing a short sale,\u00a0it may not allow one. Finally, if someone <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/co_sign.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cosigned</a> the mortgage, the lender may hold that person responsible for payment rather than doing a short sale.\n", "\nIf you think your situation is ripe for a short sale, talk to a decision-maker at the bank about the possibility of engaging in this type of transaction. Don\u2019t just talk to a customer service representative, who is often more like a spokesperson and has no real authority. To work your way up the phone ladder, immediately ask to speak with the lender\u2019s loss mitigation department. If you don\u2019t like what the first decision-maker says, try talking to another one on another day and see if you get a different answer. If the lender is willing to consider a short sale, you\u2019re ready to move forward with creating the short-sale proposal and finding a buyer.\n", "\nAt this point, you should consult an attorney, a tax professional, and a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/realestateagent.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">real estate agent</a>. While these are high-priced professional services, if you make a mistake by trying to handle a complex short-sale transaction yourself, you may find yourself in even bigger financial trouble. You may be able to pay for these service fees out of the sale proceeds from your home. Professionals accustomed to dealing with short-sale transactions will be able to give you guidance on how to pay them.\n", "\nWhen setting an asking price, make sure to factor the cost of selling the property into the total amount of money you need to get out of the situation. Of course, you want to sell the home for as close to the value of your mortgage as possible, but in a down market, there is bound to be a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortfall.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">shortfall</a>. In some states, even after a short sale, the bank will expect you to pay back all or part of that shortfall.\n", "\nGather all the documents you\u2019ll need to prove your financial hardship to the lender. These may include bank statements, medical bills, pay stubs, a termination notice from your former job, or a divorce decree. It is up to you to come up with the short-sale proposal. Be aware that the lender ultimately must approve a short sale after receiving all the details because the lender is the recipient of the proceeds. Your job is to find a buyer for your home.\n", "\nOnce you have a buyer and the necessary paperwork, you are ready to submit the buyer\u2019s offer and your proposal to the bank. Along with the documentation of your distressed financial status, your proposal should include a hardship letter explaining the circumstances that are preventing you from making your mortgage payments. You want to make it as convincing as possible and protect your interests while also appealing to the bank.\n", "\nBe careful about submitting your financial information to a lender because, if it does not approve the short sale, it may use your financial information to try to get money out of you in foreclosure proceedings. If you still have cash assets, you may be expected to use them to continue making mortgage payments or to make up some of the shortfalls between the sale price and the mortgage amount. An attorney experienced in completing short sales can help you navigate the details.\n", "\nBecause short sales can take longer than regular home sales due to the need for lender approval, they often fall through. The buyer may find another property while waiting for an answer from you. Be prepared for this possibility. If the short-sale transaction goes through, consult with the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irs.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Internal Revenue Service</a> (IRS) to see if you will have to pay taxes on the shortfall.\n", "\nAlso, be aware that a short sale can still affect your credit score in the sense that the months of mortgage payments you missed prior to the short sale can show up as delinquent payments on your credit report. It is up to the bank to decide what to report, so it\u2019s in your best interest to try to convince the bank not to report your defaulted payments.\n", "\nYour bank may be more likely to be generous in this regard if you brought up your hardship before you were significantly behind. For credit purposes, while this is somewhat damaging, it is certainly less damaging than a foreclosure.\n", "\nShort sales can also provide excellent opportunities for buyers to get into houses at a reduced price. Here are a couple of tips to help you make smart decisions when considering the purchase of a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/short-sale-property/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">short-sale property</a>.\n", "\nMost short-sale properties are listed by real estate agents and on real estate websites. Some listings may not come out and say \u201cshort sale,\u201d so you might have to look for clues within the listing, such as \u201csubject to bank approval\u201d or \u201cgive the bank time to respond.\u201d\n", "\nAn experienced real estate agent can make a big difference in terms of both finding and closing short-sale properties. Agents who specialize in short sales may hold a Short Sales and Foreclosure Resource (SFR) certification, a designation offered by the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/national-association-of-realtors.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">National Association of Realtors</a> (NAR).<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nHolders of this certification have received specialized training in short sales and foreclosures, qualifying sellers for short sales, negotiating with lenders, and protecting buyers. It\u2019s important to note that the certification doesn\u2019t guarantee that an agent will have the type of experience you are looking for, nor does a lack of certification preclude it. Either way, you\u2019ll want to vet any potential real estate agents to ensure their short-sale expertise.\n", "\nRealize in advance that short sales are complicated, time-consuming transactions. It can take weeks or months for a lender to approve a short sale, and many buyers who submit an offer end up canceling because the short-sale process is taking too long. Buyers have to be ready to wait for the bank\u2019s short sale approval. Rules for short-sale transactions vary from state to state, but the steps normally include:\n", "\nIn <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/real-estate-investing-guide/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">real estate investing</a> it is said that the money is made \u201cin the buy,\u201d meaning that a good purchase price is often the key to a successful deal. If you can get a property for a good price, you increase the odds of coming out ahead when it comes time to sell. If the purchase price is on the high end, on the other hand, you\u2019ll likely watch your profit margin erode.\n", "\nYou should be able to buy the property, put it in great condition, and sell it at a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/mortgages-real-estate/08/house-flip.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">price</a> where you can still make a profit. Investors need to be able to turn around and sell the house quickly\u2014typically at below-market\u2014and a good purchase price makes this possible.\n", "\nThe purchase price is only one important number, however. You\u2019ll have to make some other calculations as well, including:\n", "\nThese costs will vary depending on the property\u2019s condition and your plans for it. It pays to put in the time and effort to develop a realistic budget, as this is one of the figures you\u2019ll need to determine if the investment can make money. Costs to consider include material, labor, permits, inspection fees, trash removal, storage costs, and dumpster rentals. A good inspection (before making the purchase) can alert you to any large expenses, such as a cracked foundation, faulty wiring, or extensive termite damage.\n", "\nARV is an estimate of the property\u2019s <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fairmarketvalue.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fair market value</a> (FMV) after any repairs and renovations are made. Investors look at this number to determine whether a property has profit potential. The best way to evaluate a property\u2019s ARV is to look at <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/comparables.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">comparables</a> (comps)\u2014homes that have recently sold in the area (typically up to a mile away from the subject property) that have similar features in terms of square footage, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, etc.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/carrying-costs.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Carrying costs</a> are your expenses for holding onto the property. The longer you own the property, the more you will spend in carrying costs, which include:\n", "\nIn order for an investment to be profitable, the sum of your costs (the purchase price, repair and renovation costs, and carrying costs) must be lower than the ARV. If your costs are close to or higher than the ARV, it will be difficult or impossible to make a profit. You can determine the potential profit by subtracting the purchase price, repair and renovation (R&amp;R) costs and carrying costs from the ARV:\n", "\nReal estate investors might expect to earn at least a 20% profit on a property, and some use guidelines to evaluate properties in different housing markets. Under these guidelines, total investment (purchase price, R&amp;R costs, and carrying costs) should not exceed:\n", "\nIf the ARV of a property is $200,000, for example, your total investment should be limited to about $160,000 in a rising market, $140,000 in a flat market, and $120,000 in a market with falling values. The various investment levels are used to reduce risk in changing market conditions. You can risk more in a rising market because you are more likely to get your ARV or better when you sell. In a falling market, you are less likely to get your ARV, so your investment should be smaller.\n", "\nA short-sale property can provide an excellent opportunity to purchase a house for less money. In many cases, short-sale homes are in reasonable condition, and while the purchase price might be higher than a foreclosure, the costs of making the home marketable can be much lower, and the disadvantages to the seller less severe. However, because of the lengthy process, buyers and sellers must be willing to wait. An experienced real estate agent can help you determine a fair offer and negotiate with the bank.\n", "\nWhile many investors purchase short-sale properties and quickly resell them for a profit, others choose to maintain ownership and use the property for income by collecting rent. In either case, each property must be carefully evaluated prior to purchase to determine if it has profit potential.\n", "\nBecause tax laws are complicated and constantly change, it is always recommended that you consult with a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cpa.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">certified public accountant</a> (CPA) who knows about real estate investing and related tax laws to give you comprehensive and up-to-date information. It can mean the difference between making a profit and taking a loss on an investment.\n", "\nIn real estate, a short sale takes place when an owner sells their house below its mortgage value. Typically, this happens when the owner is under financial distress and is behind on mortgage payments. The owner is obligated to sell their home to a third party, while the proceeds of the sale go to the lender. Before this takes place, the lender must approve the short sale, also referred to a pre-foreclosure sale. Often the process of a short sale can take as long as a year due to the scale of paperwork involved.\u00a0\n", "\nIn a short sale, the process is initiated by the homeowner. Here, the owner will illustrate to the lender the extent of their financial distress through documents that may show a recent loss of employment, divorce decree, or bank statements. After the lender agrees to move forward, the homeowner is responsible for finding a buyer. In a foreclosure, by comparison, the lender initiates the process, essentially seizing the home after the owner has failed to make payments. Typically the process is faster than a short sale, as the lender seeks to liquidate the assets as quickly as possible.\u00a0\n", "\nIn many cases, buying a short sale property can be advantageous for prospective buyers.\u00a0 However, it is important to be aware of some of the drawbacks involved. Primarily, short sales can take a long time, with lenders sometimes taking months to approve the transaction. In addition, after the seller's approval, it may take many weeks for the bank to approve the price. If the bank believes that a foreclosure proceeding will be more lucrative, it may reject the short sale and move forward with a foreclosure instead.\u00a0\n"]}
