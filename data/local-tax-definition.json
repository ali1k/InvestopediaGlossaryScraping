Local taxes come in many forms, from property taxes and payroll taxes to sales taxes and licensing fees. They can vary widely from one jurisdiction to the next.\n", "\nTaxes levied by cities and towns are also referred to as municipal taxes.\n", "\nThe U.S. Constitution gives the federal government the authority, and the states the right, to impose taxes on their residents.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nLocal taxes fund government services including police and fire services, education and health services, libraries, road maintenance, and other programs and projects which benefit the community at large. Many of these services also receive federal funds in the form of grants.\n", "\nState, county, and municipal taxes may be referred to as local taxes, as opposed to federal taxes.\n", "\nUnlike federal taxes, the benefits arising from local taxes are generally apparent at the community level. Municipalities face a constant balancing act with regards to levying local taxes, since high taxes meet with resistance while low taxes lead to cutbacks in essential services.\n", "\nAmong the common types of taxes that many states impose are personal income tax, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corporatetax.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">corporate income tax</a>, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/estatetax.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">estate tax</a>, fuel tax, and sales tax.\n", "\nThe largest single tax bill that is received by most people is the local residential property tax imposed on homeowners. This is generally based on the assessed value of the home.\n", "\nEach state establishes the guidelines under which local governments can impose <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/propertytax.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">property taxes</a>.\n", "\nStates and cities that impose a local <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incometax.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">income tax</a> withhold the tax from employee wages. Local wage taxes are relatively rare. A total of 16 states permit them. In addition, Ohio and Pennsylvania impose local levies known as school district taxes to help fund education costs.\n", "\nA <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/salestax.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sales tax</a> is imposed on goods and services sold to residents of a state or municipality.

Many have complex sales tax laws that exclude some goods like food and reduce the percentage charged on others, such as cars. A number of states impose higher \"sin taxes\" on cigarettes and liquor.\n", "\nIn some states, a smaller city tax may be added to the state tax. Many states also have a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/use-tax.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">use tax</a>, which is due on major items purchased outside of the state, most notably vehicles.\n", "\nMunicipal authorities typically issue bonds to fund some capital projects in the community.\n", "\nInvestors who purchase <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/municipalbond.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">municipal bonds</a> are lending money to the government which promises to repay a set amount of interest and repay the principal on a future date.\n", "\nTo service the debt, that is, to fulfill interest and principal repayment obligations on the bonds, a municipal government may issue a new tax or raise existing local taxes.\n"]}
