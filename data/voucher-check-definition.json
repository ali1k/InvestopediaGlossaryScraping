A voucher is essentially the backup documents for accounts payable, invoicing, or payroll. (Accounts payable are the short-term bills owed by companies to vendors and suppliers.) The voucher is important because it is an internal\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accounting-control.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">accounting control</a>\u00a0mechanism that ensures that every payment is properly authorized and that the goods or services purchased are actually received.\n", "\nVoucher checks are commonly used by a company's payroll department and are referred to as payroll checks.

In addition, for the accounts payable department, having a file of voucher records of payments to vendors is helpful in resolving payment disputes and in preparing books for internal month-end closings.\n"]}
