Maturity mismatches can also occur when a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedge.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hedging</a> instrument and the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underlying-asset.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">underlying asset's</a> maturities are misaligned.\n", "\nA maturity mismatch may also be referred to as an asset-liability mismatch.\n", "\nThe term maturity mismatch commonly alludes to situations involving a company's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancesheet.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">balance sheet</a>. A business cannot meet its financial obligations if its short-term liabilities outweigh its <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortterm.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">short-term assets</a> and will likely run into problems, too, if its long-term assets are funded by short-term liabilities.\n", "\nMaturity mismatches can shed light on a company's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">liquidity</a>, as they show how it organizes the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maturity.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">maturity</a> of its assets and liabilities. They can also signify that the company is not using its assets efficiently, which could give rise to a squeeze in liquidity.\n", "\nMismatches can take place in hedging as well. This happens when the maturity of an underlying asset doesn't match the hedging instrument, thus creating an imperfect hedge. For example, a mismatch occurs when the underlying bond in a one-year <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bondfutures.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bond future</a> matures in three months.\n", "\nLoan or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liability.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">liability</a> maturity schedules must be monitored closely by a company's financial officers or treasurers. As much as it is prudent, they will attempt to match expected <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashflow.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cash flows</a> with future payment obligations for loans, leases, and pension liabilities.\n", "\nA bank will not take on too much in short-term funding\u2014liabilities to depositors\u2014to fund long-term <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortgage.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mortgage</a> loans or bank assets. Similarly, an insurance company will not invest in too many short-term <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixedincome.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fixed income</a> securities to meet future payouts, and a city or state treasurer's office will not invest in too many short-term securities to prepare for long-term pension payments.\n", "\nIn a broader sense, a non-financial company also carries maturity mismatch risk if, for example, it borrows a short-term loan for a project or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalexpenditure.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">capital expenditure</a> (CapEx) that will not produce cash flows until a later year. An infrastructure contractor that takes out a loan with a five-year maturity will create maturity mismatch risk if the cash flows from the project begin in 10 years.\n", "\nExact matching of maturities\u2014such as cash flows from assets to meet liabilities as they come due\u2014is sometimes not practical nor necessarily desirable. In the case of a bank that requires <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spread.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">spread</a> for profitability, borrowing short-term from depositors, and lending long-term at a higher interest rate generates a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/netinterestmargin.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">net interest margin</a> for profits.\n", "\nCompanies that borrow heavily must be mindful of their maturity schedules, as illustrated in the following example.\n", "\nFaced with the near-term maturities of two senior secured second <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lien.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lien</a> notes in 2018 and 2020, struggling home-builder K.
