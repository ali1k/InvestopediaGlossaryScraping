Regular savings contributions can go a long way toward building a long-term nest egg, and some financial professionals even go so far as to call \"pay yourself first\" the golden rule of personal finance.\n", "\nIf you are using the \"pay yourself first\" method of personal finance, you may opt to put your money in a range of savings vehicles, depending on your financial objectives. The phrase can refer to earmarking a certain percentage of your paycheck to be contributed to your retirement accounts, such as a 401(k) or an IRA.\n", "\nAlternatively, you may put the funds in a cash savings account. \"Paying yourself first\" simply involves building up a retirement account, creating an emergency fund, or saving for other long-term goals, such as buying a house.\n", "\nResearch on savings indicates that a relatively small percentage of Americans follow the \"pay yourself first\" adage. In fact, the Federal Reserve reports that in 2019 (the most recent figures available) less than 40% of Americans could not cover a $400 emergency in cash.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nThe advantage of \"paying yourself\u00a0first\" out of your paycheck is that you build up a nest egg to secure your future,\u00a0and create a cushion for financial emergencies such as your car breaking down or unexpected medical expenses. Without savings, many people report experiencing a large amount of stress. However, many people claim that they simply do not earn enough money to save\u00a0and fear that if they start saving, they may not have enough money to cover their bills.\n", "\nIt's also important to know that money set aside for retirement, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/040714/how-use-your-roth-ira-emergency-fund.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">especially in a Roth IRA</a>, is accessible if needed.
