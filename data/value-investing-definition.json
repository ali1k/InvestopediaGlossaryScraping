Most folks would agree that whether you buy a new TV on sale, or at full price, you\u2019re getting the same TV with the same screen size and picture quality.\n", "\nStocks work in a similar manner, meaning the company\u2019s stock price can change even when the company\u2019s value or valuation has remained the same. Stocks, like TVs, go through periods of higher and lower demand leading to price fluctuations\u2014but that doesn't change what you\u2019re getting for your money.\n", "\nJust like savvy shoppers would argue that it makes no sense to pay full price for a TV since TVs go on sale several times a year, savvy value investors believe stocks work the same way. Of course, unlike TVs, stocks won't go on sale at predictable times of the year such as\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blackfriday.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Black Friday</a>, and their sale prices won\u2019t be advertised.\n", "\nValue investing is the process of doing detective work to find these secret sales on stocks and buying them at a discount compared to how the market values them. In return for buying and holding these value stocks for the long-term, investors can be rewarded handsomely.\n", "\nIn the stock market, the equivalent of a stock being cheap or discounted is when its shares are <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/undervalued.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">undervalued</a>.

Intrinsic value is a combination of using financial analysis such as studying a company's financial performance, revenue, earnings, cash flow, and profit as well as fundamental factors, including the company's brand, business model, target market, and competitive advantage. Some metrics used to value a company's stock include:\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-to-bookratio.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Price-to-book (P/B)</a> or book value or, which measures the value of a company's assets and compares them to the stock price.

After reviewing these metrics, the value investor can decide to purchase shares if the comparative value\u2014the stock's current price vis-a-vis its company's intrinsic worth\u2014is attractive enough.\n", "\nValue investors require some room for error in their estimation of value, and they often set their own \"<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marginofsafety.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">margin of safety</a>,\" based on their particular risk tolerance. The margin of safety principle, one of the keys to successful value investing, is based on the premise that buying stocks at bargain prices gives you a better chance at earning a profit later when you sell them. The margin of safety also makes you less likely to lose money if the stock doesn\u2019t perform as you had expected.\n", "\nValue investors use the same sort of reasoning. If a stock is worth $100 and you buy it for $66, you\u2019ll make a profit of $34 simply by waiting for the stock\u2019s price to rise to the $100 true value. On top of that, the company might grow and become more valuable, giving you a chance to make even more money. If the stock\u2019s price rises to $110, you\u2019ll make $44 since you bought the stock on sale. If you had purchased it at its full price of $100, you would only make a $10 profit. Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing, only bought stocks when they were priced at two-thirds or less of their intrinsic value.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff This was the margin of safety he felt was necessary to earn the best returns while minimizing investment downside.\n", "\nValue investors don\u2019t believe in the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/efficientmarkethypothesis.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">efficient-market hypothesis</a>, which says that stock prices already take all information about a company into account, so their price always reflects their value. Instead, value investors believe that stocks may be over- or underpriced for a variety of reasons.\n", "\nFor example, a stock might be underpriced because the economy is performing poorly and investors are panicking and selling (as was the case during the Great Recession). Or a stock might be overpriced because investors have gotten too excited about an unproven new technology (as was the case of the dot-com bubble). Psychological biases can push a stock price up or down based on news, such as disappointing or unexpected earnings announcements, product recalls, or litigation. Stocks may also be undervalued because they trade under the radar, meaning they're inadequately covered by<strong> </strong><a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/analyst.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">analysts</a> and the media.\n", "\nValue investors possess many characteristics of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/contrarian.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">contrarians</a> \u2014they don\u2019t follow the herd. Not only do they reject the efficient-market hypothesis, but when everyone else is buying, they\u2019re often selling or standing back. When everyone else is selling, they\u2019re buying or holding. Value investors don\u2019t buy trendy stocks (because they\u2019re typically overpriced). Instead, they invest in companies that aren\u2019t household names if the financials check out. They also take a second look at stocks that are household names when those stocks\u2019 prices have plummeted, believing such companies can recover from setbacks if their fundamentals remain strong and their products and services still have quality.\n", "\nValue investors only care about a stock\u2019s intrinsic value. They think about buying a stock for what it actually is: a percentage of ownership in a company. They want to own companies that they know have sound principles and sound financials, regardless of what everyone else is saying or doing.\n", "\nEstimating the true intrinsic value of a stock involves some financial analysis but also involves a fair amount of subjectivity\u2014meaning at times, it can be more of an art than a science. Two different investors can analyze the exact same valuation data on a company and arrive at different decisions.\n", "\nSome investors, who look only at existing financials, don't put much faith in estimating future growth. Other value investors focus primarily on a company's future growth potential and estimated <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashflow.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cash flows</a>. And some do both: Noted value investment gurus <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/01/071801.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Warren Buffett</a> and Peter Lynch, who ran Fidelity Investment's Magellan Fund for several years are both known for analyzing financial statements and looking at valuation multiples, in order to identify cases where the market has mispriced stocks.\n", "\nDespite different approaches, the underlying logic of value investing is to purchase assets for less than they are currently worth, hold them for the long-term, and profit when they return to the intrinsic value or above. It doesn't provide instant gratification. You can\u2019t expect to buy a stock for $50 on Tuesday and sell it for $100 on Thursday. Instead, you may have to wait years before your stock investments pay off, and you will occasionally lose money. The good news is that, for most investors, long-term <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalgain.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">capital gains</a> are taxed at a lower rate than short-term investment gains.\n", "\nLike all investment strategies, you must have the patience and diligence to stick with your investment philosophy. Some stocks you might want to buy because the fundamentals are sound, but you\u2019ll have to wait if it\u2019s overpriced. You\u2019ll want to buy the stock that is most attractively priced at that moment, and if no stocks meet your criteria, you'll have to sit and wait and let your cash sit idle until an opportunity arises.\n", "\nIf you don\u2019t believe in the efficient market hypothesis, you can identify reasons why stocks might be trading below their intrinsic value. Here are a few factors that can drag a stock\u2019s price down and make it undervalued.\n", "\nSometimes people invest irrationally based on psychological biases rather than market fundamentals. When a specific stock\u2019s price is rising or when the overall market is rising, they buy. They see that if they had invested 12 weeks ago, they could have earned 15% by now, and they develop a fear of missing out. Conversely, when a stock\u2019s price is falling or when the overall market is declining, loss aversion compels people to sell their stocks. So instead of keeping their losses on paper and waiting for the market to change directions, they accept a certain loss by selling. Such investor behavior is so widespread that it affects the prices of individual stocks, exacerbating both upward and downward market movements creating excessive moves.\n", "\nWhen the market reaches an unbelievable high, it usually results in a bubble. But because the levels are unsustainable, investors end up panicking, leading to a massive selloff. This results in a market crash. That's what happened in the early 2000s with the dotcom bubble, when the values of tech stocks shot up beyond what the companies were worth. We saw the same thing happened when the housing bubble burst and the market crashed in the mid-2000s.\n", "\nLook beyond what you're hearing in the news. You may find really great investment opportunities in undervalued stocks that may not be on people's radars like <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/small-cap.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">small caps</a> or even foreign stocks.<strong> </strong>Most investors want in on the next big thing such as a technology startup instead of a boring, established consumer durables manufacturer. For example, stocks like Facebook, Apple, and Google are more likely to be affected by herd-mentality investing than\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/conglomerate.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">conglomerates</a>\u00a0like Proctor &amp; Gamble or Johnson &amp; Johnson.\n", "\nEven good companies face setbacks, such as litigation and recalls. However, just because a company experiences one negative event doesn\u2019t mean that the company isn\u2019t still fundamentally valuable or that its stock won\u2019t bounce back. In other cases, there may be a segment or division that puts a dent in a company's profitability. But that can change if the company decides to dispose of or close that arm of the business.\n", "\nAnalysts do not have a great track record for predicting the future, and yet investors often panic and sell when a company announces earnings that are lower than\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/analyst-expectation.asp?ad=dirN&amp;qo=investopediaSiteSearch&amp;qsrc=0&amp;o=40186\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">analysts\u2019 expectations</a>. But value investors who can see beyond the downgrades and negative news can buy stock at deeper discounts because they are able to recognize a company's long-term value.\n", "\nCyclicality is defined as the fluctuations that affect a business. Companies are not immune to ups and downs in the economic cycle, whether that's seasonality and the time of year, or consumer attitudes and moods. All of this can affect profit levels and the price of a company's stock, but it doesn't affect the company's value in the long term.\n", "\nThe key to buying an undervalued stock is to thoroughly research the company and make common-sense decisions. Value investor Christopher H. Browne recommends asking if a company is likely to increase its revenue via the following methods:\n", "\nBrowne also suggests studying a company's competitors to evaluate its future growth prospects. But the answers to all of these questions tend to be speculative, without any real supportive numerical data. Simply put: There are no quantitative software programs yet available to help achieve these answers, which makes value stock investing somewhat of a grand guessing game. For this reason, Warren Buffett recommends investing only in industries you have personally worked in, or whose consumer goods you are familiar with, like cars, clothes, appliances, and food.\n", "\nOne thing investors can do is choose the stocks of companies that sell high-demand products and services. While it's difficult to predict when innovative new products will capture market share, it's easy to gauge how long a company has been in business and study how it has adapted to challenges over time.\n", "\nFor our purposes,\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insider.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">insiders</a>\u00a0are the company\u2019s senior managers and directors, plus any shareholders who own at least 10% of the company\u2019s stock. A company\u2019s managers and directors have unique knowledge about the companies they run, so if they are purchasing its stock, it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the company\u2019s prospects look favorable.\n", "\nLikewise, investors who own at least 10% of a company\u2019s stock wouldn\u2019t have bought so much if they didn\u2019t see profit potential. Conversely, a sale of stock by an insider doesn\u2019t necessarily point to bad news about the company\u2019s anticipated performance \u2014 the insider might simply need cash for any number of personal reasons. Nonetheless, if mass sell-offs are occurring by insiders, such a situation may warrant further in-depth analysis of the reason behind the sale.\n", "\nAt some point, value investors have to look at a company's financials to see how its performing and compare it to industry peers.\n", "\nFinancial reports present a company\u2019s annual and quarterly performance results.

Couch potato investing is a passive strategy of buying and holding a few investing vehicles for which someone else has already done the investment analysis\u2014i.e., mutual funds or exchange-traded funds. In the case of value investing, those funds would be those that follow the value strategy and buy value stocks\u2014or track the moves of high-profile value investors, like Warren Buffet.

Instead, we are taught to invest in multiple stocks or stock indexes so that we have exposure to a wide variety of companies and economic sectors. However, some value investors believe that you can have a diversified portfolio even if you only own a small number of stocks, as long as you choose stocks that represent different industries and different sectors of the economy.

As a historical real example, on May 4, 2016, Fitbit released its Q1 2016 earnings report\u00a0and saw a sharp decline in after-hours trading. After the flurry was over, the company lost nearly 19% of its value. However, while large decreases in a company's share price are not uncommon after the release of an earnings report, Fitbit not only met analyst expectations for the quarter but even increased guidance for 2016.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"7\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nThe company earned $505.4 million in revenue for the first quarter of 2016, up more than 50% when compared to the same time period from one year ago. Further, Fitbit expects to generate between $565 million and $585 million in the second quarter of 2016, which is above the $531 million forecasted by analysts.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"7\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff The company looks to be strong and growing. However, since Fitbit invested heavily in research and development costs in the first quarter of the year, earnings per share (EPS) declined when compared to a year ago. This is all average investors needed to jump on Fitbit, selling off enough shares to cause the price to decline. However, a value investor looks at the fundamentals of Fitbit and understands it is an undervalued security, poised to potentially increase in the future.\n", "\nValue investing is a long-term strategy. Warren Buffett, for example, buys stocks with the intention of holding them almost indefinitely. He once said, \u201cI never attempt to make money on the stock market. I buy on the assumption that they could close the market the next day and not reopen it for five years.\u201d You will probably want to sell your stocks when it comes time to make a major purchase or retire, but by holding a variety of stocks and maintaining a long-term outlook, you can sell your stocks only when their price exceeds their fair market value (and the price you paid for them).\n", "\nValue investing is an investment philosophy that involves purchasing assets at a discount to their intrinsic value. This is also known as a security\u2019s margin of safety. Benjamin Graham, known as the father of value investing, first established this term with his landmark book, <em>The Intelligent Investor,</em> in 1949. Notable proponents of value investors include Warren Buffett, Seth Klarman, Mohnish Pabrai, and Joel Greenblatt.\n", "\nCommon sense and fundamental analysis underlie many of the principles of value investing. The margin of safety, which is the discount that a stock trades at compared to its intrinsic value, is one leading principle. Fundamental metrics, such as the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio, for example, illustrate company earnings in relation to their price. A value investor may invest in a company with a low PE ratio, because it provides one barometer for determining if a company is undervalued or overvalued.\u00a0\n", "\nAlong with analyzing a company\u2019s price-to-earnings ratio, which can illustrate how expensive a company in relation to its earnings, common metrics include the price-to-book ratio, which compares a company\u2019s share price to its book value (P/BV) per share. Importantly, this highlights the difference between a company\u2019s book value and its market value. A B/V of 1 would indicate that a company\u2019s market value is trading at its book value. Free cash flow (FCF) is another, which shows the cash that a company has on hand after expenses and capital expenditures are accounted for. Finally, the debt-to-equity ratio (D/E) looks at the extent to which a company\u2019s assets are financed by debt.\u00a0\n", "\nFirst coined by Benjamin Graham, \u201cMr. Market\u201d represents an hypothetical investor that is prone to sharp mood swings of fear, apathy, and euphoria. \u201cMr. Market\u201d represents the consequences of emotionally reacting to the stock market, rather than rationally or with fundamental analysis. As an archetype for her behavior, \u201cMr. Market\u201d speaks to the price fluctuations inherent in markets, and the emotions that can influence these on extreme scales, such as greed and fear.\n"]}
