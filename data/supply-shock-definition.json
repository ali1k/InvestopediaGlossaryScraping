Supply shocks can be negative, resulting in a decreased supply, or positive, yielding an increased supply; however, they're often negative. Assuming <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aggregatedemand.asp\">aggregate demand</a> is unchanged, a negative (or adverse) supply shock causes a product's price to spike upward,\u00a0while a positive supply shock decreases the price.\n", "\nA positive supply shock increases output causing prices to decrease due to a shift in the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/supply-curve.asp\">supply curve</a> to the right, while a negative supply shock decreases production causing prices to rise. Supply shocks can be created by any unexpected event that constrains output or disrupts the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/supplychain.asp\">supply chain</a>,\u00a0including natural disasters and geopolitical developments\u00a0such as acts of war or terrorism. A commodity that is widely perceived as the most vulnerable to negative supply shocks is crude oil\u00a0because\u00a0most of the world's supply comes from the volatile Middle East region.\n", "\nThe struggles of a single firm can cause a supply shock if the company is a large producer of high demand products such as copper. According to <em>CNBC</em>, this\u00a0was the case when Glencore announced in September 2015 its plans to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2015/10/08/glencore-cuts-zinc-ouput-by-500000-tonnes-shutters-aussie-mines.html\">close two major copper mines</a> in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia, removing 400,000 tonnes of copper from the global output. The decision came in\u00a0response to a prolonged slump in copper prices. Therefore, this particular supply shock was positive for competing firms.\n", "\nAccording to <em>The Economist</em>, a slowdown in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2015/10/01/red-scare\">Chinese demand for copper</a> caused copper prices to drop. For the previous decade, demand had grown at an annual rate of more than 10% until it fell to 3% to 4% in 2015. This\u00a0drop in price highlights how a concentrated change in demand can influence prices. A change in demand must\u00a0be abrupt and perceived as temporary to qualify as a shock, as is the case on the supply side.\n"]}
