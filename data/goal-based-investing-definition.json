Goal-based investing (GBI) involves a wealth manager or investment firm\u2019s clients measuring their progress towards specific life goals, such as saving for children\u2019s education or building a retirement nest-egg, rather than focusing on generating the highest possible\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/portfolio-return.asp\">portfolio return</a>\u00a0or beating the market.\n", "\nGoal-based investing differs from traditional investing, in that its yardstick for success is how well the investor is able to meet his or her personal life goals, rather than how well his or her investments perform against the market average in a given period.\n", "\nConsider an investor who is looking forward to retirement within a year, and who therefore cannot afford to lose even 10% of his or her portfolio. If the stock market plunges 30% in a given year and the investor\u2019s portfolio is down \u201conly\u201d 20%, the fact that the portfolio has outperformed the market by 10 percentage points would offer scant comfort. That investor needs to focus more on maintaining, rather than growing, wealth in order to reach his or her personal goal of affording retirement within a year.\n", "\nGoal-based investing re-frames success, based on clients\u2019 needs and goals. If a client\u2019s main goals are to save for imminent retirement and fund the college education of young grandchildren, an investment strategy would be more conservative for the former and relatively aggressive for the latter.\n", "\nAs an example, the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetallocation.asp\">asset allocation</a>\u00a0for the retirement assets might be 10% equities and 90% fixed-income, while the asset allocation for the education fund may be 50% equities and 50% fixed-income. Individual needs and goals, rather than risk tolerance, are what drive investing decisions made under the goal-based framework.\n", "\nThe advantages of goal-based investing include:\n", "\nGoal-based investing has grown in popularity in the years after the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/great-recession.asp\">Great Recession</a>\u00a0of 2008\u201309 as investors realized the extent to which chasing high returns could negatively impact long-term wealth accumulation. Millions of hapless investors witnessed their net worth plunge dramatically, in correlation with declines across nearly all major markets, and a steep correction in U.S. housing prices.\n", "\nSeveral teams have worked to develop more holistic investment approaches in recent years. The startup\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ellevest-review-4587894\">Ellevest</a>, for example, focuses on goal-based investing strategies, tailored to women.
