Great Society policies were\u00a0launched by then-President Lyndon B. Johnson between 1964 and 1965.\n", "\nJohnson first laid out his agenda for what he coined a \u201cGreat Society\u201d during a speech at the University of Michigan. Johnson vowed that this collection of program would lead to \"an end to poverty and racial injustice.\"<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nAlthough Johnson's policies targeted education, workforce training, healthcare, and food security, and voting and civil rights, they were centrist in their approach.\n", "\nThe initiatives that comprised the Great Society have been compared, in their scope and their intent, to President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/new-deal.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">New Deal</a> programs, enacted in the U.S. between 1933 and 1939.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"8\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nThe Great Society is considered one of the largest social reform plans in modern history. It produced Medicare, Medicaid, the Older Americans Act, and the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) of 1965, all of which remain government programs. In addition, Johnson's efforts helped to establish greater civil and voting rights, greater environmental protections, and increased aid to public schools.\n", "\nIn March 1964, Johnson introduced the Office of Economic Opportunity and the Economic Opportunity Act to Congress. Johnson wanted to address the\u00a0underprivileged members of the U.S. by creating a Job Corps. He also asked state and local governments to create\u00a0work training programs.\u00a0A national work-study program provided funding for 140,000 Americans to attend\u00a0college. Other initiatives included community action\u00a0programs, government-sponsored programs that trained volunteers to serve poor communities, loans to employers to hire the unemployed, funding for agricultural co-ops, and help for parents re-entering the workforce.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\u00a0\n", "\nWhen\u00a0Johnson took office, many of the elderly and underprivileged members of the U.S. lacked any health insurance. When Johnson became the President,\u00a0the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/medicare.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Medicare</a> and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/medicaid.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Medicaid</a> programs became part of U.S. law.

It was operated\u00a0by the Office of Economic Opportunity, and\u00a0500,000 children aged from\u00a0three to five received preschool\u00a0education.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff In 1965, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act was passed, which\u00a0guaranteed federal funding for education in school districts where the majority of students\u00a0were living in low-income households.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"5\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nGreat Society policies also focused on urban renewal.\u00a0Following <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/022516/economic-conditions-helped-cause-world-war-ii.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">World War II</a>, many major cities were\u00a0in poor condition, and affordable housing was hard to find, particularly for the disadvantaged and underprivileged.\u00a0The Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965 provided federal funds to cities so they could invest in urban development that met\u00a0minimum housing standards.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"7\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff The Act provided better\u00a0access to home mortgages and a rent-subsidy program.\n", "\nJohnson also created additional support for the arts and humanities by signing the National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities Act in 1965.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"6\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nVarious environmental initiatives set water quality standards and vehicle emission standards. Laws were also passed to protect wildlife, rivers, historic landmarks, and to create scenic trails.\n", "\nSome of Johnson\u2019s efforts were\u00a0overshadowed by the\u00a0Vietnam War. As the conflict waged on, Johnson was forced to divert funds that were supposed to promote education and help underprivileged members of society to the Vietnam War. While some Americans did not support Johnson's government-funded programs to reduce poverty, he\u00a0is perhaps better known to many Americans as the president who forced America into an unwinnable war, resulted in over 58,000 American military fatalities, rather than a champion of initiatives to help increase education levels and reduce inequality among Americans.\n"]}
