It is calculated as dIm/dY, meaning the derivative of the import function (Im) with respect to the derivative of the income function (Y).\n", "\nThe MPM indicates the extent to which\u00a0imports\u00a0are subject to\u00a0changes in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/income.asp\">income</a> or production. If, for example, a country's MPM is 0.3, then each dollar of extra income in that <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economy.asp\">economy</a> induces 30 cents of imports ($1 x 0.3).\u00a0\n", "\nCountries that consume more imports as the\u00a0income of their population\u00a0rises have a significant impact on <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/insights/what-is-international-trade/\">global trade</a>. If a country that purchases a substantial amount of goods from overseas runs into a financial crisis, the extent to which that nation\u2019s economic woes will impact <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/export.asp\">exporting</a> countries depends on its MPM and the makeup of the goods imported.\u00a0\n", "\nThe level of negative impact on imports from falling income is greater when a country has a MPM greater than its average propensity to import. This gap results in a higher\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incomeelasticityofdemand.asp\">income elasticity of demand</a>\u00a0for imports, leading to a drop in income resulting in a more than proportional drop in imports.\u00a0\n", "\nCountries with <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/developed-economy.asp\">developed economies</a> and sufficient natural resources within their borders typically have a lower MPM. In contrast, nations that are dependent on purchasing goods from abroad generally have a higher MPM.\n", "\nThe MPM is important to the study of\u00a0Keynesian economics. First, the MPM\u00a0reflects\u00a0induced imports. Second, the MPM is the slope of the imports line, which means it is the negative of the slope of the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/netexports.asp\">net exports</a> line\u00a0and makes it important to the slope of the\u00a0aggregate expenditures line, as well.\n", "\nThe MPM also affects the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/multiplier.asp\">multiplier</a>\u00a0process and the magnitude of the expenditures and tax multipliers.\n", "\nMPM is easy to measure and functions as a useful tool to predict changes in imports based on expected changes in output.\n", "\nThe problem is that a country\u2019s MPM will unlikely remain consistently stable. The relative prices of domestic and foreign goods change and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exchangerate.asp\">exchange rates</a> fluctuate.
