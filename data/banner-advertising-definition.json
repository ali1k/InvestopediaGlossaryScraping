The horizontal type of banner advertisement is called a leaderboard, while the vertical banners are called a skyscraper and are positioned\u00a0on a web page's sidebars. Banner ads are image-based rather than text-based and are a popular form of online advertising.\n", "\nThe purpose of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/010416/walmarts-new-advertising-plan.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">banner advertising</a> is to promote a brand and/or to get visitors from the host website to go to the advertiser's website.\n", "\n<strong>[Fast Fact: The first banner advertisement was deployed on Wired Magazine's website in 1994 (then called hotwired.com); the banner read \"Have you ever clicked your mouse right here?

The host is paid for the banner advertisement through one of three methods: cost per <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/impression.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">impression</a> (payment for every website visitor who sees the ad), cost per click (payment for every website visitor who clicks on the ad and visits the advertiser's website) or cost per action (payment for every website visitor who clicks on the ad, goes to the advertiser's website and completes a task, such as filling out a form or making a purchase).\n", "\nTraditional banner advertising like the example above has expanded to other forms, such as Facebook Ads and Instagram Sponsored Ads.

They keep track of what advertising space is available and match it with advertiser demand. The technology that enables ad networks to do this is a central ad server, which selects specific ads that are tailored to the website's visitor based on keywords from the visitor's\u00a0search and website viewing behavior or based on the overall context of the host website content.\n", "\nBanner advertising,\u00a0and virtually all online advertising,\u00a0currently utilizes real-time bidding technology known as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/050815/trends-and-growth-digital-advertising-industry.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">programmatic bidding</a>, which allows approved companies to bid on ad space during the time it takes for a banner ad to load.
