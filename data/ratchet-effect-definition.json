For example, if a store whose sales have been stagnant for some time adopts some company changes such as\u00a0new managerial strategies, staff overhaul, or better incentive programs,\u00a0and the store earns greater revenues than it had previously, the store will find it difficult to justify producing less. Since firms are always seeking growth and greater\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profitmargin.asp\">profit margins</a>, it is hard to scale back production.\u00a0\n", "\nThe ratchet effect refers to escalations in production or prices that tend to self-perpetuate. Once productive capacities have been added, or prices have been raised, it is difficult to reverse these changes because people are influenced by the prior highest level of production.\n", "\nThe ratchet effect first came up in\u00a0Alan Peacock\u00a0and\u00a0Jack Wiseman's work:<em> The Growth of Public Expenditure in the United Kingdom.</em> Peacock and Wiseman found that public spending increases like a ratchet, following periods of crisis. Similarly, governments have difficulty in\u00a0rolling back\u00a0huge bureaucratic organizations created initially for temporary needs, such as during times of armed conflict or economic crisis. The governmental version of the ratchet effect is similar to that experienced in large businesses that add myriad layers of\u00a0bureaucracy to support a larger, more complex array of products, services, and infrastructure to support it all.\n", "\nThe ratchet effect can also impact large-scale firm's capital investments. For example, in the auto industry, competition drives firms to be constantly creating new features for their vehicles. This requires additional investment in new machinery, or a different type\u00a0of skilled worker, which increases the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cost-of-labor.asp\">cost of labor</a>. Once an auto company has made these investments and added these features, it becomes difficult\u00a0to scale back production. The firm cannot\u00a0waste their investment in the physical <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital.asp\">capital</a> required for the upgrades or the human capital in the form of new workers.\n", "\nSimilar principles apply to\u00a0the ratchet effect from the consumer perspective because\u00a0raised expectations escalate the consumption process. If a company has been producing 20 ounces sodas for ten years and then decreases their soda size to 16 ounces, consumers may feel duped, even if there is the commensurate price decrease.\n", "\nThe ratchet effect also applies to wages and wage increases. Laborers will rarely (if ever) accept a decrease\u00a0in wages, but they may also be dissatisfied with wage increases that they considered\u00a0insufficient. If a manager receives\u00a0a 10% pay increase one year and a 5% pay increase the next year, he may feel that the new raise is insufficient although he is\u00a0still getting a pay raise.\n", "\nThe primary problem with the ratchet effect is that in certain situations, people become accustomed to constant growth even in markets that may be saturated. Thus, the market may\u00a0no longer satisfy consumer\u00a0wants and needs, defeating the overarching purpose of economics.\n", "\nIn labor markets, the ratchet effect presents itself in situations where workers, who are subject to performance pay, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w16325.pdf\">choose to restrict their output</a>. They do this because they are anticipating that the company will respond to higher output levels by raising output requirements or cutting pay. This constitutes a multi-period, principal-agent problem. However, the ratchet effect in labor markets is nearly eliminated, when competition is introduced. This is true regardless of whether market conditions favor firms or workers.\n", "\nThe ratchet effect impacts how companies spend capital. In the automobile industry, for instance, competition drives car makers to constantly incorporate new features and twists on previous models. Once the company has invested in the machinery and personnel to produce the newer versions of their cars, they can't scale back production and fall behind the competition, as this would waste previous investments. Concurrently, pressures from the consumer market are also demanding newer and better models at cheaper prices.\n", "\nThe ratchet effect can also be observed in the airline industry, which has made\u00a0frequent-flyer programs\u00a0ever harder to terminate. In addition, home appliances constantly acquire more features as do new editions of software, etc. With all such improvements, the debate is ever-present as to whether added features truly improve usability, or simply increase the tendency for people to buy the goods.\n"]}
