Investors use this buy-and-hold strategy\u00a0to replicate the performance of a specific index\u2014generally an equity or fixed-income index\u2014by purchasing the component securities of the index, or investing in an index mutual fund or exchange traded fund (ETF)\u00a0that itself closely tracks\u00a0the underlying index.\n", "\nThere are several advantages of\u00a0index investing. For one, empirical research finds index investing tends to outperform <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/activemanagement.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">active management</a> over a long time frame. Taking a hands-off approach to investing\u00a0eliminates many of the biases and uncertainties that arise in\u00a0a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockpick.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">stock-picking</a> strategy.\n", "\nIndex investing, as well as other passive strategies, may be contrasted with <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/activeinvesting.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">active investment</a>.\n", "\nIndex investing is an effective strategy to manage risk\u00a0and gain consistent <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/return.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">returns</a>. Proponents of the strategy\u00a0eschew active investing because modern financial theory claims\u00a0it's impossible to \"beat the market\" once trading costs and taxes are taken into account.\n", "\nSince index investing takes a passive\u00a0approach, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indexfund.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">index funds</a> usually have lower <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/managementfee.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">management fees</a> and expense ratios (ERs)\u00a0than actively managed funds. The simplicity of tracking the market without a portfolio manager allows providers to maintain modest fees.\u00a0Index funds also tend to be more tax-efficient than active funds because they make less frequent trades.\n", "\nMore importantly, index investing is an effective method of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/diversification.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">diversifying</a> against risks. An index fund consists of a broad basket of assets instead of a few investments. This serves to minimize <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unsystematicrisk.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">unsystematic risk</a> related to a specific company or industry without decreasing expected returns.\n", "\nFor many index investors, the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sp500.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">S&amp;P 500</a> is the most common benchmark to evaluate performance against, as it gauges the health of the U.S. economy. Other widely followed index funds track the performance of the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/djia.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dow Jones Industrial Average</a> (DJIA) and the corporate bond sector.\n", "\nPurchasing every stock in an index at its given component weight is the most complete way to ensure that a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/portfolio.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">portfolio</a> will achieve the same risk and return profile as the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/benchmark.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">benchmark</a> itself. However, depending on the index, this can be time-consuming and quite costly to implement.\n", "\nFor instance, to replicate the S&amp;P 500 index, an investor would need to accumulate positions in each of the 500 companies that are inside the index. For the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/russell2000.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Russell 2000</a>, there would need to be 2000 different positions. Depending on commissions paid to a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/broker.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">broker</a>, this can become cost-prohibitive.\n", "\nMore cost-effective ways to track an index involve only owning the most heavily-<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/weighted.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">weighted</a> index components or sampling a certain proportion, say 20%, of the index's holdings. The most cost-effective way to own an index these days is to seek out an index mutual fund or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ETF</a> that does all of that work for you, combining the entire index essentially into a single security or share.\n", "\nDespite gaining immense popularity in recent years, there are some limitations to index investing. Many index funds are formed\u00a0on a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">market capitalization</a> basis, meaning the top holdings have an outsized weight on broad market movements.

(<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=amzn\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AMZN</a>)\u00a0and Facebook Inc. (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=fb\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FB</a>), for instance, experience a weak quarter it would have a noticeable impact on the entire index.\n", "\nThis entirely passive strategy neglects a\u00a0subset of the investment universe focused on market factors such as value, momentum, and quality. These factors now constitute\u00a0a corner of investing called <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smart-beta.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">smart-beta</a>, which attempts to deliver better <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskadjustedreturn.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">risk-adjusted returns</a> than a market-cap-weighted index. Smart-beta funds offer the same benefits of a passive strategy, with the additional upside of active management, otherwise known as alpha.\n", "\nIndex mutual funds have been around since the 1970s. The one fund that started it all, founded by Vanguard chairman John Bogle in 1976, remains one of the best for its overall long-term performance and low cost.\n", "\nOver the years, the Vanguard 500 Index Fund has tracked the S&amp;P 500 faithfully, in composition and performance.
