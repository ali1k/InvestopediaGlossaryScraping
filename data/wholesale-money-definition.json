This <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wholesalebanking.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">wholesale banking</a> encompasses the market for tradable securities, such as Treasury bills, commercial paper, bankers\u2019 acceptances, foreign or brokered deposits, certificates of deposit, bills of exchange, repo agreements, federal funds, and short-lived mortgage and asset-backed securities.\n", "\nWholesale money is a way for large corporations and financial institutions to obtain working capital and other types of short-term financing\u2014and it is critical to the proper functioning of the U.S. and global financial systems.\n", "\nWholesale funding can be quick to arrange but <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/09/when-wholesale-funding-goes-bad.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">dangerous to rely on</a>, as banks discovered during the global financial crisis when the wholesale funding market collapsed.

A bank run ensued and investors took out their wholesale funds. Wachovia is reported to have lost approximately 1% (or approximately $5 billion) of its funds.
