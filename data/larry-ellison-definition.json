It was initially called Software Development Laboratories. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/harvard-business.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Harvard Business School</a>\u00a0named him Entrepreneur of the Year in 1990.\n", "\nNot much is known about how Ellison invests his billions, but he is known for his lavish spending.

A sickly child, he was adopted by his uncle and aunt. The latter died before he ended his teens. Ellison bucked the norms and his family\u2019s pressure to become a doctor to grow into one of the richest people in the world.\n", "\nIn the 1970s, Ellison, a college dropout, spun through an eight-year series of jobs that included the Fireman\u2019s Fund, Wells Fargo &amp; Company, and Amdahl Corporation.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"23\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff On the way, he picked up basic computer skills that he used as a programmer at Amdahl, where he worked on the first IBM-compatible mainframe system.\n", "\nIn 1977, Ellison and two Amdahl associates, Robert Miner and Ed Oates, launched Software Development Labs and were employed by the CIA to develop a relational database management system (RDBMS) in 1978.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"25\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff Ellison code-named the project Oracle. He actually called it Oracle version two, since he knew buyers would prefer that to a \"version one\". The programmer also based his system on a new kind of database language that he had just read about in an IBM research paper: SQL. In time, Oracle became so famous it caused Ellison to be inducted into the Academy of Achievement in 1997.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"24\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff\n", "\nBy the beginning of the 1980s, Software Development Labs had only eight employees and revenue that barely reached $1 million.

Ellison introduced new products, replaced staff, and executed management changes.\n", "\nBy 1992, Ellison introduced a popular version of the database system called Oracle 7, which swept the company to the crest of the database management field. Banks, corporations, governments, airlines, and others depended on the computer system.

He envisions several of his homes as potential art museums to house his vast art collection. He has a home for his modern art, one for his 19th-century art, and one for his French impressionism art, as well as a home built on Nanzen-ji temple grounds in Japan to house his Japanese art. His Woodside, California home, which is his primary residence, was modeled after a 16th-century Japanese emperor\u2019s palace. The 23-acre estate is worth $70 million and took more than nine years to build. Below are some of his most opulent purchases.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"10\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff\n", "\n<strong>The Island of Lanai:</strong> Ellison has been captivated with the island of Lanai since he flew over it decades ago in a private plane. When he became a multibillionaire, he realized his dream by purchasing it for $300 million.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"9\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff He owns all but 2% of the island, including two Four Seasons resorts, a movie theater, the water company, most of the island\u2019s infrastructure, and many of the houses and apartment buildings. His vision is to transform the island into a self-sufficient, eco-friendly vacation destination replete with ultra-luxury hotels and a sustainability laboratory to help make the island the first economically viable, 100% green community. He even has plans to help Lanai develop world-class commercial agriculture infrastructure. He bought two airlines and lengthened the airport runways to open up travel.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"8\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff\n", "\n<strong>Malibu:</strong> Ellison has been acquiring properties in Malibu for more than a decade. He purchased an entire strip of houses located on \u201cBillionaire Beach.\u201d One of the homes belonged to producer Jerry Bruckheimer, for which Ellison paid $18 million.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"7\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff Ellison has previously put one of his homes, a 2,800-square-foot oceanfront bungalow, up for rent for $65,000 a month during the summer.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"6\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff All of this is in addition to a string of properties he owns on Carbon Beach, along with an inland tennis club, an inn, and a restaurant. People close to Ellison have described his shopping spree as an investment, and he has monetized some of his properties. For instance, he and chef Nobu Matsuhisa, Robert De Niro, and film producer Meir Teper converted the historic Casa Malibu Inn into a lavish Japanese-style hotel called Nobu Ryokan.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"5\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff\n", "\n<strong>Porcupine Creek: </strong>This 249-acre estate includes an 18-hole golf course and a 27-room mansion patterned after an Italian villa.
