The Department of Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965 established HUD as a Cabinet-level agency within the U.S. government. The Urban Development Act of 1970 authorized the government to provide greater outlays for housing subsidy programs and rent supplement programs for low and moderate-income households.\n", "\nFunding for projects related to the act comes from a variety of sources including state, local, and federal government, donations from individuals and corporations, as well as loans through traditional and non-traditional financial institutions.\n", "\nThe act created the Community Development Corporation, a national network of\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/non-profitorganization.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">nonprofit</a>, community-based organizations focused on revitalizing their local communities, typically low-income, under-served neighborhoods that have deteriorated and where investment is scant. First and foremost, these organizations help develop\u00a0affordable housing, but they are also involved in\u00a0economic development, sanitation, street beautification, and neighborhood planning projects.\n", "\nThe Act also ran the Federal Experimental Housing Allowance Program, which began in 1973 and ended in 1979, involving more than 25,000 families in 12\u00a0metropolitan areas with some $170 million in subsidies to individual families. The idea was to see\u00a0how best to improve housing conditions for low-income people by giving them vouchers to pay for market-rate housing rather than build new public housing.\n", "\nThe Urban Institute\u00a0concluded in the late 1970s\u00a0that housing allowances \u201cdo not provide significant momentum towards most of\u00a0the stated goals of HUD policy.\"\u00a0Later policies had HUD providing subsidies directly to landlords through the Section 8 program, and building additional large public housing projects, an activity that has largely ended.\n", "\nFederal spending on housing is mostly geared toward wealthier people.\u00a0A <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www.apartmentlist.com/rentonomics/imbalance-housing-aid-mortgage-interest-deduction-vs-section-8/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">2017 study by Apartment List</a>\u00a0found the popular tax break called the<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/home-mortgage-interest.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> mortgage interest deduction</a> (MID), cost the federal government $71 billion in 2015, more than double the $29 billion spent on Section 8 funding for low-income renters. In addition,\u00a0over half of high-income households claim MID, while just 11% of low-income households receive subsidies of any kind for housing.\n"]}
