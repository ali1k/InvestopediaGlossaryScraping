The early sale by Stewart saved her a loss of $45,673. However, the sale was made based on a tip she received about Waksal selling his shares, which was not public information. After a 2004 trial, Stewart was charged with lesser crimes of obstruction of a proceeding, conspiracy, and making false statements to federal investigators. Stewart served five months in a federal corrections facility<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff .\n", "\nIn September 2017, former Amazon.com Inc.

Authorities said Kennedy gave fellow University of Washington alumni Maziar Rezakhani information on Amazon's 2015 first quarter earnings before the release. Rezakhani paid Kennedy $10,000 for the information.

Essentially, insider trading involves trading in a public company's stock by someone who has non-public, material information about that stock. Insider trading can be either legal or illegal depending on whether it conforms to SEC rules or not.\n", "\nInsider trading is deemed to be illegal when the material information is still non-public and this comes with harsh consequences, including both potential fines and jail time. Material nonpublic information is defined as any information that could substantially impact the stock price of that company. Obviously, being privy to such information could influence an investor's decision to buy or sell the security which would give them an edge over the public who do not have such access. Martha Stewart's 2001 ImClone trading is a prime example of this.\n", "\nLegal insider trading happens in the stock market on a weekly basis.\u00a0The question of legality stems from the SEC's attempt to maintain a fair marketplace. Basically, it is legal when company insiders engage in trading company stock as long as they report these trades to the SEC in a timely manner. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 was the first step to the legal disclosure of transactions of company stock. For example, directors and major owners of stock must disclose their stakes, transactions and change of ownership.\n"]}
