However, before a company can manage itself strategically, it first needs to define its objectives precisely, identify and quantify its available and potential resources, and devise a specific plan to use its finances and other <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/032715/what-are-some-examples-different-types-capital.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">capital resources</a> toward achieving its goals.\n", "\nStrategic financial management is about creating profit for the business and ensuring an acceptable return on investment (ROI). Financial management is accomplished through business financial plans, setting up financial controls, and financial decision making.\n", "\n<strong>[Important: \"Strategic\" management focuses on long-term success and \"tactical\" management relates to short-term positioning.]</strong>\n", "\nFinancial management itself involves understanding and properly controlling, allocating, and obtaining a company's assets and liabilities, including monitoring operational financing items like expenditures, revenues, accounts receivable and payable, cash flow,\u00a0and profitability.\n", "\n<em>Strategic </em>financial management encompasses all of the above <em>plus </em>continuous evaluating, planning,\u00a0and adjusting to keep the company focused and on track\u00a0toward long-term goals. When a company is managing strategically, it deals with short-term issues on an ad hoc basis in ways that do not derail its long-term vision. Strategic financial management includes assessing and managing a company's capital structure, the mix of debt and equity finance employed, to ensure a company's long-term solvency.\n", "\nThe term \"strategic\"\u00a0refers to financial management practices that are focused on long-term success, as opposed to \"tactical\" management decisions, which relate to short-term positioning. If a company is being strategic instead of tactical, then it makes financial decisions based on what it thinks would achieve results ultimately\u2014that is, in the future; which implies that to realize those results, a firm sometimes must tolerate losses in the present.\n", "\nPart of effective strategic financial management thus may involve sacrificing or readjusting short-term goals in order to attain the company's long-term objectives more efficiently. For example, if a company suffered a net loss for the previous year, then it may choose to reduce its asset base through closing facilities or reducing staff, thereby decreasing its operating expenses. Taking such steps may result in restructuring costs or other <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/one-time-item.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">one-time items</a> that negatively affect the company's finances further in the short term, but which position the company better to succeed in the long term.\n", "\nThese short-term versus long-term tradeoffs often need to be made with various stakeholders in mind. For instance, shareholders of public companies may discipline management for decisions that negatively affect a company's share price in the short term, even though the long-term health of the company becomes more solid by the same decisions.\n", "\nA company will apply strategic financial management throughout its organizational operations, which involves designing elements that will maximize the firm's financial resources and using them efficiently. Here a firm needs to be creative, as there is no one-size-fits-all approach to strategic management, and each company will devise elements that reflect its own particular needs and goals. However, some of the more common elements of strategic financial management could include the following.\n", "\nJust as financial management strategies will vary from company to company, they also can differ according to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/industrysector.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">industry and sector</a>.\n", "\nFirms that operate in fast-growing industries\u2014like information technology or technical services\u2014would want to choose strategies that cite their goals for growth and specify movement in a positive direction. Their objectives, for example, might include launching a new product or increasing <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/122214/what-difference-between-revenue-and-income.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">gross revenue</a> within the next 12 months.\n", "\nOn the other hand, companies in slow-growing industries\u2014like sugar manufacturing or coal-power production\u2014could choose objectives that focus on protecting their assets and managing expenses, such as reducing administrative costs by a certain percentage.\n"]}
