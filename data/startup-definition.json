Startups are founded by one or more entrepreneurs who want to develop a product or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/personal-service-activity.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">service</a> for which they believe there is demand. These companies generally start with high costs and limited revenue, which is why they look for capital from a variety of sources such as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/venturecapitalist.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">venture capitalists</a>.\n", "\nStartups are companies or ventures that are focused around a single product or service that the founders want to bring to market. These companies typically don't have a fully developed <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/businessmodel.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">business model</a> and, more crucially, lack adequate <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">capital</a> to move onto the next phase of business. Most of these companies are initially funded by their founders.\n", "\nMany startups turn to others for more funding: family, friends and venture capitalists. Silicon Valley is known for its strong venture capitalist community and is a popular destination for startups, but is also widely considered the most demanding arena. Startups can use <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/seedcapital.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">seed capital</a> to invest in research and to develop their business plans. Market research helps determine the demand for a product or service, while a comprehensive business plan outlines the company's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/missionstatement.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mission statement</a>, visions and goals, as well as management and marketing strategies.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dotcom.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dotcoms</a> were a common startup in the 1990s. Venture capital was extremely easy to obtain during this time due to a frenzy among investors to speculate on the emergence of these new businesses. Unfortunately, most of these internet startups eventually went bust due to major flaws in their business plans, such lacking a path to sustainable <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/revenue.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">revenue</a>. However, a handful of companies survived when the dotcom <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bubble.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bubble</a> burst. Both Amazon (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=amzn\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AMZN</a>) and eBay (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"5\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=ebay\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">EBAY</a>) are examples.\n", "\nMany startups fail within the first few years. That's why this initial period is important. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/entrepreneur.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Entrepreneurs</a> need to find money, create a business model and business plan, hire key personnel, work out intricate details such as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equity.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">equity</a> stakes for partners and investors, and plan for the long run.

The location depends on the product or service being offered. For example, a technology startup selling <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/virtual-reality.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">virtual reality</a> hardware may need a physical storefront to give customers a face-to-face demonstration of the product's complex features.\n", "\nStartups need to consider what legal structure best fits their entity. A sole proprietorship\u00a0is suited for a founder who is also the key employee of a business. Partnerships\u00a0are a viable legal structure for businesses that consist of several people who have joint ownership, and they're also fairly straightforward to establish. Personal liability can be reduced by registering a startup as a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/llc.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">limited liability company (LLC)</a>.\n", "\nStartups often raise funds by turning to family and friends or by using venture capitalists.

A perfect <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-history.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">credit history</a> may allow the startup to use a line of credit as funding. This option carries the most risk, particularly if the startup is unsuccessful. Other companies choose small business loans to help fuel growth.
