Investors who adopt\u00a0a bull approach purchase\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp\">securities</a> under the assumption that they\u00a0can sell them later at a higher price. Bulls are optimistic investors who are\u00a0attempting to profit from the upward movement of stocks, with certain <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/031115/what-common-strategy-traders-implement-when-using-volume-weighted-average-price-vwap.asp\">strategies</a> suited to that theory.\n", "\nBullish investors identify\u00a0securities that are likely to increase in value and direct available funds toward those investments.\u00a0Opportunities to assume the position of a bull investor exist even when an overall market or sector is in a bearish trend. Bull investors look for growth opportunities within the down market and may look to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalize.asp\">capitalize </a>should market conditions reverse.\n", "\nTo limit the risk of losses, a bull may employ the use of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stop-lossorder.asp\">stop-loss orders</a>. This allows the investor to specify a price at which to sell the associated security should prices begin to move downward. Additionally, these investors may purchase <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/putoption.asp\">puts </a>to help compensate for any risk present in a portfolio.\n", "\nBull investors must be mindful of what is\u00a0commonly known as bull traps. A bull trap exists when an investor believes a sudden increase in the value of a particular security is the beginning of a trend resulting in the investor going long. This can\u00a0lead to a buying frenzy where, as more investors purchase the security, the price continues to inflate. Once those interested in purchasing the security have completed the trades, demand may decline and lead to lower associated prices for the security.\n", "\nAs the price declines, bull investors must choose whether to hold or sell the security. If investors begin to sell, the price may experience further decline. This may prompt\u00a0a new round of investors to begin selling their holdings and\u00a0driving the price down even further. In cases where a bull trap did exist, the price of the associated stock often does not recover.\n", "\nA bear is the opposite of a bull. Bear investors believe that the value of a specific security or an industry is likely to decline in the future. For example, if you are bullish on the S&amp;P 500, you attempt to profit from a rise in the index by going long. Bears, in comparison, are pessimistic and believe that a particular security, commodity or entity is set to suffer a decline in price.\n", "\nBullishness and bearishness do not necessarily apply only to the stock market. People can be bullish or bearish on any investment opportunity, including real estate,\u00a0commodities\u00a0such as soy beans, crude oil or even peanuts.\n"]}
