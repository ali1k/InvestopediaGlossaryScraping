The regulations surrounding LLCs vary from state to state.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff LLC owners are generally called members.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"5\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nMany states don't restrict ownership, meaning anyone can be a member including individuals, corporations, foreigners and foreign entities, and even other LLCs. Some entities, though, cannot form LLCs, including banks and insurance companies.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"6\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nAn LLC is a more formal partnership arrangement that requires <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/articles-of-organization.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">articles of organization</a> to be filed with the state.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff An LLC is much easier to set up than a corporation and provides more flexibility and protection.\n", "\nLLCs may elect not to pay federal taxes. Instead, profits and losses are listed on the personal tax returns of the owner(s). Or, the LLC may choose a different classification, such as a corporation.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"6\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff <span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"7\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff If fraud is detected or if a company hasn't met legal and reporting requirements, creditors may be able to go after the members.\n", "\nAlthough the requirements for LLCs may vary by state, there are generally some commonalities across the board. The very first thing owners or members must do is to choose a name.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"8\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nOnce that's done, the articles of organization must be documented and filed with the state. These articles establish the rights, powers, duties, liabilities, and other <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/llc-operating-agreement.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">obligations</a> of each member of the LLC.\u00a0Other information included on the documents includes the name and addresses of the LLC's members, the name of the LLC's registered agent, and the business' statement of purpose.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nThe articles of organization must be accompanied by a fee paid directly to the state. Paperwork and additional fees must also be submitted at the federal level to obtain an employer identification number (EIN).<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"9\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nThe primary reason business owners opt to take the LLC route\u00a0is to limit the principals' liability. Many view an LLC\u00a0as a blend of a partnership, which is a simple business formation of two or more owners under an agreement, and a corporation, which has\u00a0certain liability protections.\n", "\nAlthough LLCs have some attractive features, they also have several disadvantages, especially concerning the structure of a corporation. Depending on state law, an LLC may have to be dissolved upon the death or bankruptcy of a member.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"10\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff This is in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042015/what-caused-american-industrial-revolution.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">contrast to a corporation</a>, which can exist in perpetuity. An LLC may not be a suitable option when the founder's\u00a0ultimate objective\u00a0to\u00a0become a publicly-traded company.\n", "\nThe primary difference between a partnership\u00a0and an LLC is that an LLC separates the business assets of the company from the personal assets of the owners, insulating\u00a0the owners from the LLC's debts and liabilities.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"11\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nAn LLC can function in the same way a partnership does, in that the company's profits pass through to the tax returns of the owners.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff Losses can be used to offset other income but only up to the amount invested. If the LLC has organized as a partnership, then it must file <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/form-1065.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Form 1065</a>.

Without\u00a0a business continuation agreement, the remaining partners must dissolve the LLC and create a new one if\u00a0a partner files bankruptcy or dies.\n", "\nA limited liability company, commonly referred to as an \u201cLLC\u201d, is a type of business structure commonly used in the United States. LLCs can be seen as a hybrid structure that combines features of both a corporation and a partnership. Like a corporation, LLCs provide their owners with limited liability in the event the business fails. But like a partnership, LLCs \u201cpass through\u201d their profits so that they are taxed as part of the owners\u2019 personal income.\n", "\nLimited liability companies are a popular type of business structure for <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedgefund.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hedge funds</a> and other investment management businesses. Often, hedge funds will be structured so that two layers of LLCs are involved: the first LLC is owned by the fund\u2019s investors, while a second LLC is designated as the manager of that fund. In that scenario, the individual managers responsible for making investment decisions benefit from two layers of liability protection. And since the profits earned can be passed on to the individual investors, this structure prevents the issue of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/double_taxation.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">double taxation</a>.\n", "\nYes, limited liability companies are taxed differently from corporations. In the case of a corporation, profits are first taxed at the corporate level and are then taxed a second time once those profits are distributed to the individual shareholders. This \u201cdouble taxation\u201d can be quite inefficient from an investor\u2019s point of view. Limited liability companies, on the other hand, allow the profits to be passed through directly to the investors so that they are taxed only once, as part of the investors\u2019 personal income.\n"]}
