On the other hand, this growth and job creation are not distributed evenly across industries or countries.\n", "\nSpecific industries in certain countries, such as textile manufacturing in the U.S. or corn farming in Mexico, have suffered severe disruption or outright collapse as a result of increased international competition.\n", "\nGlobalization's motives are idealistic, as well as opportunistic, but the development of a global free market has benefited large corporations based in the Western world. Its impact remains mixed for workers, cultures, and small businesses around the globe, in both developed and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/emergingmarketeconomy.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">emerging nations</a>.\n", "\nGlobalization is not a\u00a0new concept. Traders\u00a0traveled vast distances in ancient times to buy <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commodity.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">commodities</a> that were rare and expensive for sale in their homelands.

The core of most trade agreements is the removal or reduction of tariffs.\n", "\nThis evolution of economic systems has increased industrialization and financial opportunities in many nations. Governments now focus on removing barriers to trade and promoting international commerce.\n", "\nProponents of globalization believe\u00a0it\u00a0allows\u00a0developing countries to catch up to industrialized nations through increased manufacturing, diversification, economic expansion, and improvements in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standard-of-living.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">standards\u00a0of living</a>.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outsourcing.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Outsourcing</a> by companies brings jobs and technology to developing countries, which help them to grow their economies.

For example, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/09/financial-crisis-review.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the 2008 financial crisis</a> had a severe impact on Portugal, Ireland, Greece, and Spain.

Starbucks,\u00a0Nike, and\u00a0Gap dominate commercial space\u00a0in many nations. The sheer size and reach of the U.S. have made the cultural exchange among nations largely a one-sided affair.\n", "\nIn essence, globalization is about the world becoming increasingly interconnected. Countries today are more connected than ever before, due to factors such as air travel, containerized sea shipping, international trade agreements and legal treaties, and the Internet. In the world of business, globalization is associated with trends such as outsourcing, free trade, and international supply chains.\n", "\nProponents of globalization will point to the dramatic decline in poverty that has taken place throughout the world over the past several decades, which many economists attribute in part to increased trade and investment between nations. Similarly, they will argue that globalization has allowed products and services such as cellphones, airplanes, and information technology to be spread far more widely throughout the world. On the other hand, critics of globalization will point to the negative impact it has had on specific nations\u2019 industries, which might face increased competition from international firms. Globalization can also have negative environmental impacts due to economic development, industrialization, and international travel.\n", "\nGlobalization is important because it is one of the most powerful forces affecting the modern world, so much so that it can be difficult to make sense of the world without understanding globalization. For example, many of the largest and most successful corporations in the world are in effect truly multinational organizations, with offices and supply chains stretched right across the world. These companies would not be able to exist if not for the complex network of trade routes, international legal agreements, and telecommunications infrastructure that were made possible through globalization. Important political developments, such as the ongoing trade conflict between the United States and China, are also directly related to globalization.\n"]}
