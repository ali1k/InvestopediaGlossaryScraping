Since it is not fully amortized, a balloon payment is required at the end of the term to repay the remaining principal balance of the loan. Balloon loans can be attractive to short-term borrowers because they typically carry lower interest rates than loans with longer terms. However, the borrower must be aware of refinancing risks\u00a0as there's a risk the loan may reset at a higher interest rate.\n", "\nMortgages are the loans most commonly associated with balloon payments. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balloon-mortgage.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Balloon mortgages</a> typically have short terms ranging from five to seven years. However, the monthly payments through this short term are not set up to cover the entire loan repayment. Instead, the monthly payments are calculated as if the loan is a traditional 30-year mortgage. (See the mortgage calculator below for an example of how a conventional fixed-rate mortgage is calculated).\n", "\nThat said, the payment structure for a balloon loan is very different from a traditional loan. Here's why: At the end of the five to seven-year term, the borrower has paid off only a fraction of the principal balance, and the rest is due all at once. At that point, the borrower may sell the home to cover the balloon payment or take out a new loan to cover the payment, effectively refinancing the mortgage. Alternatively, they may make the payment in cash.\n", "\nLet's say a person takes out a $200,000 mortgage with a seven-year term and a 4.5% interest rate. Their monthly payment for seven years is $1,013. At the end of the seven-year term, they owe a $175,066 balloon payment.\n", "\nSome balloon loans, such as a five-year balloon mortgage, have a reset option at the end of the five-year term that allows for a resetting of the interest rate, based on current interest rates, and a recalculation of the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/amortization.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">amortization</a> schedule, based on a new term. If a balloon loan does not have a reset option, the lender expects the borrower to pay the balloon payment or refinance the loan before the end of the original term.\n", "\nIf interest rates are very high and, say for a mortgage, the borrower isn't planning to be at that location for long, a balloon loan could make sense. But it comes with high risk when the loan term is up. What's more, if interest rates are low or are expected to rise, they may well be higher when the borrower needs to refinance.\n", "\nFor some buyers, a balloon loan has clear advantages.\n", "\nBut having a loan with a giant balloon payment of most or all of the principal also has clear disadvantages.\n", "\nThere's also an underlying risk of opting for a balloon loan: It's easy to be fooled by the smallness of the original interest-only (or mostly) monthly payment into borrowing more money than an individual can comfortably afford to borrow. That is also a potential road to financial ruin.\n"]}
