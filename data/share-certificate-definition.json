The share certificate basically acts as a receipt for purchase and ownership of shares in the company. The document certifies registered ownership of shares from a particular date.\n", "\nKey information on\u00a0a share certificate includes:\n", "\nIn the UK, The Companies Act 2006 directs that a company must issue a share certificate when any shares are allotted (issued). The company must issue a share certificate within two months of the issue or transfer of any shares. Companies may issue just one certificate for all the shares issued or transferred at a particular time, except if a shareholder requests\u00a0separate certificates.\n", "\nSometimes a shareholder with a stock certificate can give a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proxy.asp\">proxy</a> to another person to vote the shares in question. Similarly, a shareholder without a share certificate may give a proxy to another person to allow them to vote the shares in question. Voting rights are defined by the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corporatecharter.asp\">corporation's charter</a> and corporate law.\n", "\nA share certificate that is damaged, lost\u00a0or stolen can be reissued with a replacement certificate in respect of the same number of shares. The shareholder in such a case\u00a0must return the damaged document to the company before a replacement can be issued. At this time, the shareholder may also exercise the right to be issued\u00a0a single certificate or separate certificates.\n", "\nHistorically, share certificates were required for proof of entitlement to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp\">dividends</a>. Each time a certificate was presented, the receipt for the payment of dividends was endorsed on the back. This way, all records of dividend payments\u00a0were\u00a0attached to the document.\n", "\nToday, in modern financial markets, individual investors rarely take physical possession of their share certificates. In fact, some countries, such as Sweden, have completely abolished the issue of share certificates as proof of share ownership in a company and have streamlined the process of registering owners\u00a0via electronic registration.\n", "\nIn the United States, the Central Securities Depository (CSD) is responsible for electronically holding shares, either in certificated or uncertificated (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dematerialization.asp\">dematerialized</a>) form, so that ownership can be easily transferred through a book entry rather than the transfer of physical certificates.\n", "\nA share certificate can be in either a registered form or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearerform.asp\">bearer form</a>. A registered share certificate is only evidence of title ownership, while a bearer share certificate, now uncommon, entitles the holder to exercise all legal rights associated with the stock.\n", "\nMany share certificates, especially older and more rare specimens, have become extremely collectible for their historical context and the beauty and intricacy of their design.\u00a0\"Scripophily\" is the collection and study of share certificates and other similar financial documents.\u00a0Similar to stamp collecting or banknote collecting, a share certificate's value is dependent on its condition and age.\n"]}
