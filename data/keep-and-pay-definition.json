It lets a person keep an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">asset</a> such as a house or car, provided that the individual continues to make payments.\n", "\nKeep and pay is a bankruptcy strategy in which an individual who wants to keep an asset following a bankruptcy resolution agrees to follow a payment schedule and sets forth their intentions in court documents.\n", "\nAll exemptions in bankruptcy refer to assets the filer gets to retain. All other property that is nonexempt can be liquidated by the court to help settle the filer's outstanding debts.\n", "\nKeep and pay prevents people from having a particular asset repossessed and possibly <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidate.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">liquidated</a>, but it sometimes requires them to file an official statement with the bankruptcy court that shows they have a plan to pay for the asset going forward. Typically, this plan must also get the approval of the affected creditor.\n", "\nGenerally, creditors are open to keep and pay plans if it appears likely they will be able to collect on the entirety of the\u00a0debt owed, rather than possibly settling for something less based on a court order. In addition, it can often eliminate hassles on the part of the creditor.\u00a0\n", "\nFor example, say a person files bankruptcy and owes a substantial amount on a home. The bank can eventually sell the property to recoup the remaining amount owed on the mortgage, but it could take time and\u00a0considerable effort, and thus, added cost. If that seems likely, it could be advantageous for the bank to take the chance of\u00a0getting repaid under a Keep-and-Pay agreement.\n", "\nFor each asset in a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/chapter7.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chapter 7 bankruptcy</a>, for example, the filer typically is asked what they want to do with each valuable piece of property, including whether they wish to surrender it, retain and redeem it, keep it and pay what is owed over time, or do something else with it.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nFor this reason, the person filing can request to keep and pay for particular items. The court won\u2019t always agree to such a request, however,\u00a0many courts try to follow the filer\u2019s wishes if they are made in good faith. Others have guidelines on what to do with assets based on the type of asset, its value, and the remaining amount owed.\n", "\nAs an example, guidelines could address whether or not an asset is illiquid, and cannot easily be sold to\u00a0cover a person\u2019s debts, or whether an asset is pertinent to a person's livelihood, such as a car that may be necessary for a\u00a0person to get to and from work.\n", "\nRules regarding keep and pay and various bankruptcy exemptions vary by state. Most filers must use the rules set forth by the state in which they live. However, a few states such as California have two sets of exemption rules\u2014one under state law and the other a federal list of rules.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\"></span> Bankruptcy filers need to choose one set of rules or the other and use them consistently throughout the bankruptcy proceedings.\n", "\nFor property, for instance, many states set an exemption value. You can keep and pay if the property value is worth less than a threshold set by the exemption rules.\n", "\nAs an example, say a person filing for bankruptcy has a home worth $160,000,\u00a0with an outstanding mortgage balance of $140,000, and $20,000 in equity. Their state of residence allows an exemption\u00a0amount up to $175,000, which exceeds the value of the home. In this instance, the filer would be able to keep the home.\n", "\nConversely, if the home was worth $200,000 with the same mortgage balance, leaving $60,000 in equity, it would exceed the\u00a0exemption threshold. This would require a court-appointed trustee to liquidate the property, pay the mortgage holder\u00a0$140,000 from the proceeds, and to distribute the remaining funds to any additional creditors, prior to the filer receiving\u00a0any of the equity.\n", "\nSam has been terminated from employment and is unable to make timely mortgage payments. Sam's mortgage lender refuses to renegotiate the terms of the loan payment and has insinuated that it will seek to seize the property via foreclosure. Meanwhile, as other debts and expenses climb, Sam enters bankruptcy.\n", "\nRight after filing for bankruptcy, Sam finds a new job that will provide enough income to make the mortgage payments, but with several cutbacks to previous lifestyle and amenities. In effect, Sam will have to live a more frugal life. Sam submits a plan to the bankruptcy court detailing a breakdown of the proposed new mortgage payments and expenses. The court approves this plan, and Sam gets to keep the house.\n"]}
