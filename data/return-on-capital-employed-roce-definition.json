There are two components required to calculate return on capital employed: earnings before interest and tax and capital employed.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebit.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">EBIT</a>, also known as operating income, shows how much a company earns from its operations alone without regard to interest or taxes. EBIT is calculated by subtracting the cost of goods sold and operating expenses from revenues.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalemployed.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Capital employed</a>\u00a0is very similar to invested capital, which is used in the ROIC calculation. Capital employed is found by subtracting total assets from current liabilities, which ultimately gives you shareholders\u2019 equity plus long-term debts. Instead of using capital employed at an arbitrary point in time, some analysts and investors may choose to calculate ROCE based on the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/return-on-average-capital-employed-roace.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">average capital employed</a>, which takes the average of opening and closing capital employed for the time period under analysis.\n", "\nROCE can be especially useful when comparing the performance of companies in capital-intensive sectors, such as utilities and telecoms. This is because unlike other fundamentals such as\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/09/return-on-equity-vs-return-on-capital.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">return on equity</a>\u00a0(ROE), which only analyzes profitability related to a company\u2019s shareholders\u2019 equity,\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/011215/what-difference-between-roce-and-roe.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ROCE considers debt and equity</a>. This can help neutralize financial performance analysis for companies with significant debt.\n", "\nUltimately, the calculation of ROCE tells you the amount of profit a company is generating per $1 of capital employed. Obviously, the more profit per $1 a company can generate the better. Thus, a higher ROCE indicates stronger <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profitabilityratios.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">profitability</a> across company comparisons.\n", "\nFor a company, the ROCE trend over the years can also be an important indicator of performance. In general, investors tend to favor companies with stable and rising ROCE levels over companies where ROCE is volatile or trending lower.\n", "\nConsider two companies that operate in the same industry: Colgate-Palmolive and Procter &amp; Gamble. The table below shows a hypothetical ROCE analysis of both companies.\n", "\nAs you can see, Procter &amp; Gamble is a much larger business than Colgate-Palmolive, with higher revenue, EBIT, and total assets. However, when using the ROCE metric, you can see that Colgate-Palmolive is more efficiently generating profit from its capital than Procter &amp; Gamble. Colgate-Palmolive\u2019s ROCE is 44 cents per capital dollar or 43.51% vs. 15 cents per capital dollar for Procter &amp; Gamble or 15.47%.\n", "\nWhen analyzing profitability efficiency in terms of capital, both ROIC and ROCE can be used. Both metrics are similar in that they provide a measure of profitability per total capital of the firm. In general, both the ROIC and ROCE should be higher than a company\u2019s <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wacc.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">weighted average cost of capital</a> (WACC) in order for the company to be profitable over the long-term.\n", "\nROIC is generally based on the same concept as ROCE, but its components are slightly different. The calculation for ROIC is as follows:\n", "\nNet operating profit after tax: This is a measure of EBIT x (1 \u2013 tax rate). This takes into consideration a company\u2019s tax obligations, but ROCE usually does not.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/invested-capital.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Invested capital</a>: Invested capital in the ROIC calculation is slightly more complex than the simple calculation for capital employed used in ROCE. Invested capital may be either:\n", "\nOr:\n", "\nIn general, the invested capital is a more detailed analysis of a firm\u2019s overall capital.\n", "\nBusinesses use their capital in order to carry on day-to-day operations, invest in new opportunities, and grow. Capital employed simply refers to a company's total assets less its current liabilities. Looking at capital employed is helpful since it's used with other financial metrics to determine the return on a company's assets as well as how effective management is at employing capital.\n", "\nSome analysts prefer return on capital employed over return on equity (ROE) and return on assets (ROA) since it takes both debt and equity financing into consideration, and is a better gauge for the performance or profitability of the company over a longer period of time.\n", "\nReturn on capital employed is calculated by dividing net operating profit, or earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), by employed capital. Another way to calculate it is by dividing earnings before interest and taxes by the difference between total assets and current liabilities.\n", "\nWhile there is no industry standard, a higher return on capital employed suggests a more efficient company, at least in terms of capital employment. However, a higher number may also be indicative of a company with a lot of cash on hand since cash is included in total assets. As a result, high levels of cash can sometimes skew this metric.\n"]}
