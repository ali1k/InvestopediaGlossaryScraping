The expense ratio gauges the efficiency of an insurer and how well it uses its resources to drive top-line growth. The combined ratio is arguably the most important of these three ratios because it provides a comprehensive measure of an insurer's profitability.\n", "\nThe combined ratio is typically expressed as a percentage. A ratio below 100 percent\u00a0indicates that the company is making an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underwriting.asp\">underwriting</a> profit, while a ratio above 100 percent\u00a0means that it is paying out more money in claims that it is receiving from premiums. Even if the combined ratio is above 100 percent, a company can potentially still be profitable\u00a0because the ratio does not include investment income.\n", "\nMany insurance companies believe that the combined ratio\u00a0is the best way to measure success because it does not include investment income and only includes profit\u00a0earned through efficient management.\u00a0This is\u00a0important\u00a0to note\u00a0since a portion of dividends will be invested in equities, bonds, and other securities. The <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investment-income-ratio.asp\">investment income ratio</a> (investment income divided by net premiums earned) takes investment income into account and is used in the calculation of the overall operating ratio.\n", "\nAs a hypothetical example, if an insurer collects $1,000 in policy premiums and\u00a0pays out $800 in claims and claim-related expenses, plus another $150 in operating expenses, it would have a combined ratio of (800 + 150) / 1,000 = 95%.\n", "\nLet's take another example: insurance company ZYX has incurred underwriting expenses of $10 million, incurred losses and\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/loss-adjustment-expense-lae.asp\">loss adjustment expenses</a>\u00a0of $15 million, net written premiums of $30 million and earned premiums of $25 million. We can calculate ZYX's financial basis combined ratio by adding the incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses with the incurred underwriting expenses. The financial basis combined ratio is 1, or 100% (($10 million + $15 million) / $25 million).\n", "\nThe financial basis gives a snapshot of the current year's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/statutory-audit.asp\">statutory\u00a0financial statements</a>. We can also calculate the combined ratio on a trade basis, where you divide the incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses by earned premiums and add to the incurred underwriting expenses divided by net\u00a0written premiums. The trade basis combined ratio of insurance company XYZ is 0.93, or 93% = ($15 million / $25 million + $10 million / $30 million).\n", "\nThe loss ratio measures the total incurred losses in relation to the total collected\u00a0insurance premiums, while the combined ratio measures the incurred losses and expenses in relation to the total collected premiums. The combined ratio is essentially <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042315/what-difference-between-loss-ratio-and-combined-ratio.asp\">calculated</a> by adding the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/loss-ratio.asp\">loss ratio</a>\u00a0and\u00a0expense ratio.\n", "\nThe\u00a0loss ratio\u00a0is calculated by dividing the total incurred losses by the total collected insurance premiums. The lower the ratio, the more profitable the insurance company and vice versa. If the loss ratio is above 1, or 100%, the insurance company is likely to be unprofitable and may be in poor financial health because it is paying out more in\u00a0claims than it is receiving in premiums.\n", "\nThe components of the combined ratio each tell a story\u00a0and should be examined both together and separately in order to understand what is driving the insurer to be profitable or unprofitable. Policy dividends are generated from the premiums generated from the insurer\u2019s underwriting activities.\n", "\nThe loss and loss-adjustment ratio demonstrate how much it costs the insurer to offer one dollar of protection. The expense ratio shows how expensive it is to generate new business since it takes into account commissions, salaries, overhead, benefits, and operating costs.
