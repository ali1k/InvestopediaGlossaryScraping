The Housing and Economic Recovery Act allowed the Federal Housing Administration (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federal-housing-administration.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FHA</a>) to guarantee up to $300 billion in new, 30-year fixed-rate mortgages for <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/subprime-borrower.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">subprime borrowers</a>. In order to participate, lenders were required to write down the balances on principal loans up to 90% of their current appraised value.\n", "\nThe Housing and Economic Recovery Act was ultimately intended to renew public faith in government-sponsored enterprises (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gse.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GSEs</a>) that provided home loans\u2014namely <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/091814/fannie-mae-what-it-does-and-how-it-operates.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fannie Mae</a> and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/freddiemac.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Freddie Mac</a>. It allowed states to refinance subprime loans with mortgage revenue bonds and created the Federal Housing Finance Agency (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fhfa.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FHFA</a>). As a new agency, the FHFA used its newfound authority to put Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac under conservatorship in 2008.\n", "\nHERA also included a number of sub-title acts under the main act, including:\n", "\nThis subtitle act in HERA offered\u00a0a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/refundablecredit.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">refundable</a> tax credit for qualified <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/firsttimehomebuyer.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">first-time homebuyers</a>\u2014related to purchases on or after April 9, 2008, and before July 1, 2009\u2014equal to 10% of the purchase price of a principal residence, up to $7,500. It also eliminated the credit for taxpayers with incomes over $75,000 ($150,000 for joint returns).\n", "\nFor those receiving the tax credit,\u00a0repayment was expected\u00a0over 15 years via\u00a0equal installments through a\u00a0surcharge on the taxpayers\u2019 annual income taxes. It also\u00a0provided emergency assistance for the redevelopment of abandoned and foreclosed homes.\n", "\nThis subtitle act increased the FHA loan limit from 95% to 110% of area median home price, up to 150% of the GSE conforming loan limit (i.e., $625,000). It also mandated a 3.5% <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/down_payment.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">down payment</a> for all FHA loans and placed a 12-month <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/moratorium.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">moratorium</a> on the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's implementation of risk-based premiums. It also prohibited seller-funded down payments while authorizing the FHA to insure up to $300 billion of 30-year fixed-rate refinance loans up to 90% of appraised for distressed borrowers. Mortgage commitments made on or before January 1, 2008, were covered under the act.\n", "\nIn addition, the act required existing mortgage holders to accept the proceeds of the insured loan as payment in full for all preexisting indebtedness.\u00a0Lender participation in this program was\u00a0voluntary.\n", "\nThis part of the act required all states to implement a mortgage loan originator (MLO) licensing and registration system by August 1, 2009 (or August 1, 2010, for legislatures that meet biennially). States were allowed to\u00a0operate their own systems, subject to stringent federal standards, or they can participate in the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry (NLMS).\n"]}
