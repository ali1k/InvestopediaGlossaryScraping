Multipliers are also used in explaining fractional reserve banking, known as the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deposit_multiplier.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">deposit multiplier</a>.\n", "\nA multiplier is simply a factor that amplifies or increase the base value of something else. A multiplier of 2x, for instance, would double the base figure. A multiplier of 0.5x, on the other hand, would actually reduce the base figure by half.

Consumers who receive the initial $1 billion will save $250 million and spend $750 million, effectively initiating another, smaller\u00a0round of stimulus. The recipients of that $750 million will spend $562.5 million, and so on.\n", "\nAn <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investment-multiplier.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">investment multiplier</a> similarly refers to the concept that any increase in public or private investment has a more than proportionate positive impact on aggregate income and the general economy. The multiplier attempts to quantify the additional effects of a policy beyond those immediately measurable. The larger an investment's multiplier, the more efficient it is at creating and distributing wealth throughout an economy.\n", "\nThe <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earningsmultiplier.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">earnings multiplier</a> frames a company's current stock price in terms of the company's\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eps.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">earnings per share</a>\u00a0(EPS) of stock.

It is a measure of financial\u00a0leverage. Companies finance their operations with equity or debt, so a higher equity multiplier indicates that a larger portion of asset financing is attributed to debt. The equity multiplier is thus a variation of the\u00a0debt ratio, in which the definition of debt financing includes all liabilities.\n", "\nOne popular multiplier theory and its equations were created by British economist <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/john_maynard_keynes.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">John Maynard Keynes</a>. Keynes believed that any injection of government spending created a proportional increase in overall income for the population, since the extra spending would carry through the economy. In his 1936 book, \"The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money,\" Keynes wrote the following equation to describe the relationship between income (Y), consumption (C) and investment (I):\n", "\n<span data-value=\"\\begin{aligned} &amp;Y = C + I \\\\ &amp;\\textbf{where:}\\\\ &amp;Y=\\text{income}\\\\ &amp;C=\\text{consumption}\\\\ &amp;I=\\text{investment}\\\\ \\end{aligned}\">\ufeff<span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\">\n<math>\n<semantics>\n<mrow>\n<mtable>\n<mtr>\n<mtd>\n<mstyle>\n<mrow></mrow>\n</mstyle>\n</mtd>\n<mtd>\n<mstyle>\n<mrow>\n<mrow></mrow>\n<mi>\nY\n</mi>\n<mo>\n=\n</mo>\n<mi>\nC\n</mi>\n<mo>\n+\n</mo>\n<mi>\nI\n</mi>\n</mrow>\n</mstyle>\n</mtd>\n</mtr>\n<mtr>\n<mtd>\n<mstyle>\n<mrow></mrow>\n</mstyle>\n</mtd>\n<mtd>\n<mstyle>\n<mrow>\n<mrow></mrow>\n<mtext>\nwhere:\n</mtext>\n</mrow>\n</mstyle>\n</mtd>\n</mtr>\n<mtr>\n<mtd>\n<mstyle>\n<mrow></mrow>\n</mstyle>\n</mtd>\n<mtd>\n<mstyle>\n<mrow>\n<mrow></mrow>\n<mi>\nY\n</mi>\n<mo>\n=\n</mo>\n<mtext>\nincome\n</mtext>\n</mrow>\n</mstyle>\n</mtd>\n</mtr>\n<mtr>\n<mtd>\n<mstyle>\n<mrow></mrow>\n</mstyle>\n</mtd>\n<mtd>\n<mstyle>\n<mrow>\n<mrow></mrow>\n<mi>\nC\n</mi>\n<mo>\n=\n</mo>\n<mtext>\nconsumption\n</mtext>\n</mrow>\n</mstyle>\n</mtd>\n</mtr>\n<mtr>\n<mtd>\n<mstyle>\n<mrow></mrow>\n</mstyle>\n</mtd>\n<mtd>\n<mstyle>\n<mrow>\n<mrow></mrow>\n<mi>\nI\n</mi>\n<mo>\n=\n</mo>\n<mtext>\ninvestment\n</mtext>\n</mrow>\n</mstyle>\n</mtd>\n</mtr>\n</mtable>\n</mrow>\n<annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\n\\begin{aligned} &amp;Y = C + I \\\\ &amp;\\textbf{where:}\\\\ &amp;Y=\\text{income}\\\\ &amp;C=\\text{consumption}\\\\ &amp;I=\\text{investment}\\\\ \\end{aligned}\n</annotation>\n</semantics>\n</math></span><span class=\"katex-html\"><span class=\"strut\"></span><span class=\"strut bottom\"></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mtable\"><span class=\"col-align-r\"><span class=\"vlist-t vlist-t2\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\"><span class=\"\"><span class=\"pstrut\"></span><span class=\"mord\"></span></span><span class=\"\"><span class=\"pstrut\"></span><span class=\"mord\"></span></span><span class=\"\"><span class=\"pstrut\"></span><span class=\"mord\"></span></span><span class=\"\"><span class=\"pstrut\"></span><span class=\"mord\"></span></span><span class=\"\"><span class=\"pstrut\"></span><span class=\"mord\"></span></span></span><span class=\"vlist-s\">\u200b</span></span><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\"></span></span></span></span><span class=\"col-align-l\"><span class=\"vlist-t vlist-t2\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\"><span class=\"\"><span class=\"pstrut\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord\"></span><span class=\"mord mathit\">Y</span><span class=\"mrel\">=</span><span class=\"mord mathit\">C</span><span class=\"mbin\">+</span><span class=\"mord mathit\">I</span></span></span><span class=\"\"><span class=\"pstrut\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord\"></span><span class=\"mord text\"><span class=\"mord mathbf\">where:</span></span></span></span><span class=\"\"><span class=\"pstrut\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord\"></span><span class=\"mord mathit\">Y</span><span class=\"mrel\">=</span><span class=\"mord text\"><span class=\"mord mathrm\">income</span></span></span></span><span class=\"\"><span class=\"pstrut\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord\"></span><span class=\"mord mathit\">C</span><span class=\"mrel\">=</span><span class=\"mord text\"><span class=\"mord mathrm\">consumption</span></span></span></span><span class=\"\"><span class=\"pstrut\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord\"></span><span class=\"mord mathit\">I</span><span class=\"mrel\">=</span><span class=\"mord text\"><span class=\"mord mathrm\">investment</span></span></span></span></span><span class=\"vlist-s\">\u200b</span></span><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\"></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>\ufeff\n", "\nThe equation states that for any level of income, people spend a fraction and save/invest the remainder. He further defined the marginal propensity to save and the marginal propensity to consume (MPC), using these theories to determine the amount of a given income that is invested. Keynes also showed that any amount used for investment would be reinvested many times over by different members of society. For example, assume a saver invests $100,000 in a savings account at his bank.\n", "\nBecause the bank is only required to maintain a portion of that money on hand to cover deposits, it can loan out the remainder of the deposit to another party. Assume the bank loans out $75,000 of the initial deposit to a small construction company, who uses it to build a warehouse. The funds spent by the construction company go to pay electricians, plumbers, roofers, and various other parties to build it.\n", "\nThese parties then go on to spend the funds they receive according to their own interests. The $100,000 has earned a return for the investor, the bank, the construction company and the contractors that built the warehouse. Since Keynes' theory showed that investment was multiplied, increasing incomes for many parties, Keynes coined the term \"multiplier\" to describe the effect.\n", "\nThe deposit multiplier is frequently confused, or thought to be synonymous, with the money multiplier. However, although the two terms are closely related, they are not interchangeable. If banks loaned out all available\u00a0capital\u00a0beyond their required reserves, and if borrowers spent every dollar borrowed from banks, then the deposit multiplier and the money multiplier would be essentially the same.\n", "\nIn actual practice, the money multiplier, which designates the actual multiplied\u00a0change in a nation's money supply created by loan capital beyond bank's reserves, is always less than the deposit multiplier, which can be seen as the maximum potential money creation through the multiplied effect of bank lending.\n"]}
