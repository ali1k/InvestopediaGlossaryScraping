A gross lease can be modified to meet the needs of the tenants. For example, a gross lease may exclude utilities requiring the tenant to absorb those costs.\n", "\nA gross lease allows the tenant to pay\u00a0a flat fee in exchange for the exclusive use of the property. Landlords typically calculate a rent amount that would reasonably cover the cost of rent, standard utilities, and other expected and everyday expenses.\u00a0This\u00a0rent calculation may be done through analysis or from historical property data. The landlord and tenant can also negotiate the amount and terms of the lease. For example, a tenant may ask the landlord to include janitorial or landscaping services.\n", "\nFor some tenants, gross leases are favorable because they allow tenants to precisely budget their living expenses, or in the case of a business rental, the business expenses. These leases are especially beneficial for individuals with limited resources or businesses that seek to minimize variable costs to maximize profit.\u00a0Companies can concentrate on growing their business without the complexities associated with net leases.\u00a0\n", "\nA modified gross lease contains\u00a0the\u00a0principal\u00a0provisions associated with a gross lease, but it can be adjusted to suit the needs of the property owner and the tenant. These modifications may state that the tenant is responsible for the costs associated with the electric utility, but that the property owner is responsible for waste pickup.\n", "\nA gross lease may cost a tenant more than if the property\u00a0was used through a\u00a0<a class=\"CMY_Link CMY_Valid\" data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/net-lease.asp\">net lease</a>. The estimate used to calculate the flat rent amount may exceed the actual costs\u00a0associated with\u00a0the lease, returning a positive net benefit to the landlord and negative\u00a0benefit\u00a0to the tenant. However, some find more\u00a0benefit\u00a0in having a fixed gross payment than a fixed net payment with\u00a0associated variable\u00a0expenses.\n", "\nWhen comparing a gross lease vs. a\u00a0net lease, a net lease\u00a0is an exact opposite. Under a net lease, the tenant is responsible for some or all costs associated with the property such as utilities, maintenance, insurance, and other expenses.\u00a0There are three types of net leases.\u00a0\n", "\nNet leases may allow tenants more control over\u00a0some\u00a0costs and aspects of the property, but they come with an increased degree of responsibility. If maintenance is a cost borne by the tenant, they may have the ability to make cosmetic changes. However, they will also absorb most repair costs. Often, landlords restrict or prohibit cosmetic changes to the property even when maintenance is a tenant expense. Tenants are also subject to variable\u00a0utility\u00a0costs. To regulate\u00a0the expenses, they may employ different strategies to reduce consumption.\n"]}
