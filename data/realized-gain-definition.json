It occurs when an asset is sold at a level that exceeds its <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bookvalue.asp\">book value</a> cost.\n", "\nWhile an asset may be carried on a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/04/031004.asp\">balance sheet</a> at a level far above cost, any gains while the asset is still being held are considered unrealized as the asset is only being valued at <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fairmarketvalue.asp\">fair market value</a>. If selling an asset results in a loss, there is a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/realizedloss.asp\">realized loss</a> instead.\n", "\nRealized gains and unrealized gains vary considerably. An unrealized gain most often refers to a gain reported on a company\u2019s financial statements and will appreciate the value of the specified asset on a company\u2019s books. Unrealized gains are typically not taxed. They add to an asset\u2019s originally reported book value at the time of purchase and can occur on all types of assets and investments held by a company.\n", "\nThe assets are included on the company\u2019s balance sheet; however, they may be reported with or without the unrealized gains. Unrealized gains for an asset can help to determine its selling price since these gains are added to the asset\u2019s book valuation.\n", "\nAn asset\u2019s value, held on the company\u2019s books, most often includes the total <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unrealizedgain.asp\">unrealized gain</a> for which it has received and appreciated above its originally booked price. However, unrealized gains may sometimes be off-balance sheet accruals allowing the asset to remain at book value until a sale.\n", "\nThe sale of an asset takes place when a company chooses to eliminate it from the balance sheet. Asset sales can occur for various reasons and purposes and are reported on the financial statements of a company during the period in which the asset sale takes place.\n", "\nAsset sales are regularly monitored to ensure the asset is sold at fair market value or arm\u2019s length price. This regulation ensures companies are valuing the sale appropriately in the marketplace and takes into consideration whether the asset is sold to a related or unrelated party.\n", "\nWhen an asset is sold, a realized profit is achieved, and the firm predictably sees an increase in its <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentassets.asp\">current assets</a> and a gain from the sale. The realized gain from the sale of the asset may lead to an increased tax burden since realized gains from sales are typically taxable income, while unrealized gains are not taxable income. This is one drawback of selling an asset and turning an unrealized \"paper\" gain into a realized gain.\n", "\nIn most business cases, companies do not incur any tax until a realized and tangible profit occurs.\n", "\nWhile realized gains are actualized, an unrealized gain is a potential profit that exists on paper, resulting from an investment. It is an increase in the value of an\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp\">asset</a>\u00a0that has yet to be sold for cash, such as a stock position that has increased in value but still remains open. A gain becomes\u00a0realized\u00a0once the position is sold for a profit.\n", "\nWhen unrealized gains present, it usually means an investor believes the investment has room for higher future gains. Otherwise, he would sell now and recognize the current gain. Additionally, unrealized gains sometimes come about because holding an investment for an extended time period lowers the tax burden of the gain.\n", "\nFor example, if an investor holds a stock for longer than one year, his tax rate is reduced to the long-term\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital_gains_tax.asp\">capital gains tax</a>. Further, if an investor wants to move the capital gains tax burden to another tax year, he can sell the stock in January of a proceeding year, rather than selling in the current year.\n", "\nInvestors should also note the distinction between realized gains and realized income. Realized income refers to income that you have earned and received, such as income from wages or a salary as well as income from interest or dividend payments.\n"]}
