Strategies for transforming a developing economy tend to be unique because the social and political backgrounds of countries can vary\u00a0dramatically.

It believed the higher the supply of gold and silver, the more wealthy it would be.

They focus on a policy that is isolationist so that the industries within a nation are able to grow without the threat of competition from established companies in other countries.\n", "\nThe economy of the early United States is a prime example of economic nationalism. As a new nation, it sought to develop itself without relying so much on outside influences.
