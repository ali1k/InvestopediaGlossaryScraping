There is typically a process consumers and companies follow when making first notice of loss.\n", "\nThe insurance claims process involves a series of procedures from the time the insurer is alerted to when a settlement is made.\n", "\nFirst notice of loss starts the wheel of the claims cycle and is when the policyholder notifies the insurer of an unfortunate event. In the case of auto insurance, a driver informs the insurance company of a crash that occurred involving a vehicle.\n", "\nThe driver is matched with a claims adjuster whose role is to determine fault and amount of settlement. The adjuster determines the nature and severity of the damage to the policyholder\u2019s car. His assessment relies on the police report, the other driver\u2019s testimony, any witness account of the incident, a medical examiner\u2019s report, and the damage done to the insured car.\n", "\nFirst notice of loss usually requires the insured to provide the following: policy number, date and time of theft or damage, location of the incident, police report number, and personal account of how the incident happened.\n", "\nIn addition to this information provided, the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/claims-adjuster.asp\">claims adjuster</a> also uses accounts of the other driver and available witnesses and may visit the scene of the accident to determine fault.\n", "\nIf the policyholder is deemed to be at fault, the insurance company covers the cost of repairs and bodily harm for both parties. The policyholder\u2019s premium cost will also go up if renewing the policy for another term.\n", "\nA lot of unfavorable outcomes can result in the claims process. The adjuster may receive different accounts of how and when the event happened, resulting in an unfair settlement judgment.\n", "\nMedical bills may be duplicated, resulting in the insurer paying out more to the insured, which in turn results in the insured reaching their policy limits sooner.\n", "\nFrom FNOL to the final settlements step, there could be a lag of time of weeks as the adjuster may have to do some traveling to investigate the event and causes. If the insurance company is not diligent, it may pay on a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurance-fraud.asp\">fraudulent claim</a>.\n", "\nTo solve the problems and challenges apparent in a claims system, a group of companies are implementing technology-driven products to enhance the operations of the insurance sector. This group, known as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurtech.asp\">insurtech</a>, is creating apps and tools that result in consistency, efficiency, and accuracy for both the insurer and the insured while reducing the cost of claims.\n", "\nFor example, insurance companies are implementing telematics technology into their claims processes. When a crash\u00a0occurs, the telematics box of a car immediately notifies the insurer of the event.\n", "\nThe box incorporates GPS technology and records the date, time, and location of the occurrence, and relays it\u00a0to the insurance company. The insurer treats the information received from the telematics device as its first notice of loss.\n", "\nThis way, the adjuster is confident that the information received is accurate and consistent with similar accounts of the event. The possibility of a fraudulent claim can also be easily verified using a telematics tool.\n", "\nSome insurers are relying on the use of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/predictive-modeling.asp\">predictive modeling</a> techniques with big data to determine the risk level of a claim and how it should be treated. This analytics tool ensures that less time and fewer mistakes occur during the settlement process. The risk of a fraudulent claim is also analyzed with this technique, preventing the insurer from making any payments to such claims.\n", "\nInsurance dashboards simplify the claims process for both the insurer and the policyholder, as FNOL can be initiated through the dashboard. Pictures and other important documents with the information required by the adjuster can be uploaded using the dashboard. This saves both parties time and resources in mailing documents (insured) and traveling to the location of the damaged asset to conduct an inspection (insurer).\n"]}
