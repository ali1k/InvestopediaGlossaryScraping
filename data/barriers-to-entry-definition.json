These can include high <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/09/business-startup-costs.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">start-up costs</a>, regulatory hurdles, or other obstacles that prevent new competitors from easily entering a business sector. Barriers to entry benefit existing firms because they protect their market share and ability to generate revenues and profits.\n", "\nCommon barriers to entry include special tax benefits to existing firms, patent protections, strong brand identity, customer loyalty, and high customer <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/switchingcosts.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">switching costs</a>. Other barriers include the need for new companies to obtain licenses or regulatory clearance before operation.\n", "\nSome barriers to entry exist because of government intervention, while others occur naturally within a free market. Often, companies <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/043015/why-lobbying-legal-and-important-us.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lobby the government</a> to erect new barriers to entry. Ostensibly, this is done to protect the integrity of the industry and prevent new entrants from introducing inferior products into the market.\n", "\nGenerally, firms favor barriers to entry in order to limit competition and claim a larger market share when they are already comfortably ensconced in an industry. Other barriers to entry occur naturally, often evolving over time as certain industry players establish dominance.\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042115/what-are-key-barriers-entry-companies-electronics-sector.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Barriers to entry</a> are often classified as primary or ancillary.\u00a0\n", "\nA primary barrier to entry presents as a barrier alone (e.g., steep startup costs).\u00a0An ancillary barrier is not a barrier in and of itself. Rather, combined with other barriers, it weakens the potential firm's ability to enter the industry.\u00a0In other words, it reinforces other barriers.\n", "\nIndustries heavily regulated by the government are usually the most difficult to penetrate. Examples include commercial airlines, defense contractors and cable companies.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"8\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff <span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"7\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff <span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"6\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff The government creates formidable barriers to entry for varying reasons. In the case of commercial airlines, not only are regulations stout, but the government limits new entrants to limit air traffic and simplifying monitoring. Cable companies are heavily regulated and limited because their <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/infrastructure.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">infrastructure</a> requires extensive public land use.\n", "\nSometimes the government imposes barriers to entry not by necessity but because of lobbying pressure from existing firms.

Brand identity and customer loyalty serve as barriers to entry for potential entrants. Certain brands, such as Kleenex and Jell-O, have identities so strong that their brand names are synonymous with the types of products they manufacture.\n", "\nHigh consumer switching costs are barriers to entry as new entrants face difficulty enticing prospective customers to pay the additional money required to make a change/switch.\n", "\nIndustry sectors also have their own barriers to entry that stem from the nature of the business as well as the position of powerful incumbents.\n", "\nBefore any company can make and market even a generic pharmaceutical drug in the United States, it must be granted a special authorization by the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fda.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FDA</a>.

As of 2017, the median review time from receipt of application to approval was 37 months.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nMoreover, just 18% of applications are approved in the first cycle.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff Each application is incredibly political and even more expensive. In the meantime, established pharmaceutical companies can replicate the product awaiting review and then file a special 180-day market exclusivity patent, which essentially steals the product and creates a temporary monopoly.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nOn average, it takes at least $2.6 billion to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/072913/8-stages-new-drug-development.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bring a new drug to market</a>. Just as significantly, it can take up to 10 years for a drug to be approved for a prescription. Even if a startup company had the $2.6 billion to develop and test the drug according to FDA rules, it still might not receive revenue for 10 years.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff The FDA usually approves about one in 10 clinically tested drugs.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"5\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nConsumer electronics with mass popularity are more susceptible to\u00a0<a class=\"pseudoStyle\" data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economiesofscale.asp\">economies of scale</a> and scope as barriers. Economies of scale mean that an established company can easily produce and distribute a few more units of existing products cheaply because overhead costs, such as management and real estate, are spread over a large number of units. A small firm attempting to produce these same few units must divide overhead costs by its relatively small number of units, making each unit very costly to produce.\n", "\nEstablished electronics companies, such as Apple (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=aapl\">AAPL</a>), may strategically build in switching costs to retain customers. These strategies may include contracts that are costly and complicated to terminate or software and data storage that cannot be transferred to new electronic devices. This is prevalent in the smartphone industry, wherein\u00a0consumers may pay termination fees and face the cost of reacquiring applications when they consider switching phone service providers.\n", "\nThe\u00a0barriers to entry\u00a0in the oil and gas sector are extremely strong and include high resource ownership, high startup costs,\u00a0patents\u00a0and copyrights in association with proprietary technology, government, and environmental regulations, and high fixed operating costs. High startup costs mean that very few companies even attempt to enter the sector. This lowers potential competition from the start. In addition, proprietary technology forces even those with high startup capital to face an immediate operating disadvantage upon entering the sector.\n", "\nHigh fixed operating costs make companies with startup capital wary of entering the sector. Local and foreign governments also force companies within the industry to closely comply with environmental regulations. These regulations often require capital to comply, forcing smaller companies out of the sector.\n", "\nIt is generally very expensive to establish a new financial services company. High fixed costs and large sunk costs in the production of\u00a0wholesale financial services make it difficult for startups to compete with large firms that have scale efficiencies. Regulatory barriers exist between commercial banks, investment banks, and other institutions and, in many cases, the costs of compliance and threat of litigation are sufficient to deter new products or firms from entering the market.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/compliance-cost.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Compliance and licensure costs</a>\u00a0are disproportionately damaging to smaller firms.
