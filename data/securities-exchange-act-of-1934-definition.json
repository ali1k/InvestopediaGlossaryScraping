The SEC has the power to oversee securities\u2014stocks, bonds, and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otc.asp\">over-the-counter</a> securities\u2014as well as markets and the conduct of financial professionals, including brokers, dealers, and investment advisors. It also monitors the financial reports that <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/publiccompany.asp\">publicly traded companies</a> are required to disclose.\n", "\nAll companies listed on stock exchanges must follow the requirements outlined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Primary requirements include registration of any securities listed on stock exchanges, disclosure, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proxy.asp\">proxy</a> solicitations, and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margin.asp\">margin</a> and audit requirements. The purpose of these requirements is to ensure an environment of fairness and investor confidence.\n", "\nThe SEA of 1934 granted the SEC broad authority to regulate all aspects of the securities industry. It is led by five commissioners, who are appointed by the president, and has five divisions: Division of Corporation Finance, Division of Trading and Markets, Division of Investment Management, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/division-of-enforcement.asp\">Division of Enforcement</a>\u00a0and Division of Economic and Risk Analysis.\n", "\nThe SEC has the power and responsibility to lead investigations into potential violations of the SEA, such as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insidertrading.asp\">insider trading</a>, selling unregistered stocks, stealing customers' funds, manipulating <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market-price.asp\">market prices</a>, disclosing false financial information, and breaching broker-customer integrity.\n", "\nAlso, the SEC enforces corporate reporting by all companies with more than $10 million in assets and whose shares are held by more than 500 owners.\n", "\nThe SEA of 1934 was enacted by Franklin D. Roosevelt's administration as a response to the widely held belief that irresponsible financial practices were one of the chief causes of the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock-market-crash-1929.asp\">1929 stock market crash</a>. The SEA of 1934 followed the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/securitiesact1933.asp\">Securities Act of 1933</a>, which required corporations to make public certain financial information, including stock sales and distribution.\n", "\nOther regulatory measures put forth by the Roosevelt administration include the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, the Trust Indenture Act of 1934, the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investadvact.asp\">Investment Advisers Act of 1940</a>, and the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investmentcompanyact.asp\">Investment Company Act of 1940</a>. They all came in the wake of a financial environment in which the commerce of securities was subject to little regulation, and controlling interests of corporations were amassed by relatively few investors without public knowledge.\n"]}
