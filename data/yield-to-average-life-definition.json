This is typical\u00a0when the bonds are trading below par. The average life, in this case, may be significantly less than the actual number of years until maturity.\n", "\nA sinking fund is a means of repaying funds borrowed through a bond issue through periodic payments to a trustee who retires part of the issue by purchasing the bonds in the\u00a0open market.\u00a0A sinking fund improves a corporation's creditworthiness, letting the business pay investors a lower interest rate.\n", "\nYield-to-average life allows investors to determine the expected return of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mbs.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mortgage-backed securities</a> (MBS), because of the prepayment of the underlying mortgage debt.
