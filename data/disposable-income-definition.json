For example, economists use disposable income as a starting point to calculate metrics such as <a class=\"pseudoStyle\" data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/discretionaryincome.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">discretionary income</a>, personal savings rates, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marginalpropensitytoconsume.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">marginal propensity to consume\u00a0(MPC)</a>, and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marginal-propensity-save.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">marginal propensity to save\u00a0(MPS)</a>.
