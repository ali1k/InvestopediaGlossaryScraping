Formed in 1999, the G-20 has the mandate to promote global economic growth, international trade, and regulation of financial markets.\n", "\nBecause the G-20 is a forum, not a legislative body, its agreements and decisions have no legal impact, but they do influence countries' policies and global cooperation. Together, the economies of the G-20 countries represent about\u00a090%\u00a0of the\u00a0gross world product\u00a0(GWP), 80% of\u00a0world trade, and two-thirds of the\u00a0world population. After its inaugural\u00a0leaders' summit in 2008, the leaders of the G-20 announced that the group would replace the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/g8.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">G-8</a>\u00a0as the main economic council of nations.\u00a0\n", "\nThe topics discussed by G-20 evolve in concert with the main global financial concerns of its membership. Initially, the group's discussion had a focus on the sustainability of\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sovereign-debt.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sovereign debt\u00a0</a>and global financial stability. Those themes have continued as frequent topics at the G-20's summits, along with discussions about global\u00a0economic growth,\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/insights/what-is-international-trade/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">international trade</a>, and\u00a0the regulation of financial markets.\n", "\nThe 2019 G-20 Osaka summit illustrated how the G-20's topics reflect changing concerns. Hosted by Japan for the first time and held between June 28-29, 2019, the summit focused on the global economy, trade and investment, innovation, the environment and energy, employment, women's empowerment, development, and health. The previous year, Argentina proposed a focus on the future of work, infrastructure for development, and a\u00a0sustainable food\u00a0future. That meeting also included talks on the regulation of\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cryptocurrency.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cryptocurrencies\u00a0</a>and the U.S.-China <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trade-war.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">trade war</a>. The 2020 summit will be held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on November 21-22. Upcoming summits include 2021 (Italy), and 2022 (New Delhi).\n", "\nThe G-20's ranks include all members of the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/g7.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Group of Seven</a> (G-7), a forum of the seven countries with the world's largest <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/developed-economy.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">developed economies</a>: France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. Formed in 1975, the G-7 meets annually on international issues, including economic and monetary matters.\n", "\nApart from being older than the G-20, the G-7 has sometimes been described as a more political body, since all of its meetings have long included not only finance ministers but chief ministers, including presidents and prime ministers. However, the G-20, since the global financial crisis of 2008, has increasingly held summits that include political leaders as well as finance ministers and bank governors.\n", "\nAnd where the G-7 exclusively comprises developed countries, many of the additional 12 nations that make up the G-20 are drawn from those with developing economies. Indeed, having a forum at which developed and emerging nations could confer was part of the impetus for creating the G-20.\n", "\nIn 2014, the G-7 and G-20 took different approaches to membership by Russia after the country made military incursions into Ukraine and eventually annexed the Ukrainian territory of Crimea. G-7, which Russia had formally joined in 1998 to create the G-8, suspended the country's membership in the group; Russia subsequently decided to formally leave the G-8 in 2017.\n", "\nWhile Australia, host of the 2014 G-20 summit in\u00a0Brisbane, proposed to ban\u00a0Russia\u00a0from the summit over its role, Russia has remained a member of the larger group, in part because of strong support from Brazil, India, and China, who together with Russia are collectively known as the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bric.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BRIC</a> nations.\n", "\nAlong with the members of the G-7,\u00a012 other nations currently comprise the G-20: Argentina,\u00a0Australia,\u00a0Brazil,\u00a0China,\u00a0India,\u00a0Indonesia,\u00a0Mexico,\u00a0Russia,\u00a0Saudi Arabia,\u00a0South Africa,\u00a0South Korea,\u00a0and Turkey.\n", "\nIn addition, the G-20 invites guest countries to attend their events. Spain\u00a0is invited permanently as is the current chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations\u00a0(<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asean.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ASEAN</a>); two African countries (the chair of the\u00a0African Union\u00a0and a representative of the\u00a0New Partnership for Africa's Development) and at least one country invited by the presidency, usually from its own region. Countries invited to the 2019 G-20 Osaka Summit, for example, included the Netherlands, Singapore, Spain, and Vietnam.\n", "\nInternational organizations such as the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/imf.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">IMF</a>, the World Bank, the United Nations, the Financial Stability Board, and the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wto.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">World Trade Organization</a> also attend the summits.\n", "\nThe chairmanship of the G-20 leaders' summit rotates among four groups of countries. As each group's turn comes up, its members negotiate among themselves to decide who chairs the meeting.\n", "\nSince its inception, some of the G-20's operations have drawn controversy. Concerns include transparency and accountability, with critics calling attention to the absence of a formal charter for the group and the fact that some of the most important G-20 meetings are held behind closed doors.\n", "\nSome of the group's policy prescriptions have also been unpopular, especially with liberal groups. Protests at the group's summits have, among other criticisms, accused the G-20 of encouraging trade agreements that strengthen large corporations, of being delinquent\u00a0in combating\u00a0climate change, and in failing to address social inequality\u00a0and global threats to democracy.\n", "\nThe G-20's membership policies have come under fire, too. Critics say the group is overly restrictive, and its practice of adding guests, such as those from African countries, is little more than a token effort to make the G-20 reflective of the world's economic diversity. Former US President\u00a0Barack Obama\u00a0noted the challenge of determining who can join such a powerful group: \"Everybody wants the smallest possible group that includes them. So, if they're the 21st largest nation in the world, they want the G-21, and think it's highly unfair if they have been cut out.\"\n"]}
