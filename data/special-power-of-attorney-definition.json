For example, you might want a power of attorney if you are out of the country and unable to carry out a business transaction yourself, or if your abilities are limited by a medical condition. The person who initiates a power of attorney, whether in oral or written form, is referred to as the grantor or principal. The authorized individual named in the agreement is referred to as the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/attorneyinfact.asp\">attorney\u00a0in\u00a0fact</a> or agent. In the case of a special power of attorney, the actions that the agent can take are limited to very specific circumstances.\n", "\nBecause this type of power of attorney is limited to what has been laid out in the signed document, it is particularly important that the principal is very clear about the powers that they want the agent to have. Additionally, the principal may create more than one special power of attorney, naming a different individual in each one.\n", "\nWhile a special power of attorney gives the agent authority for a limited set of actions under a restricted set of circumstances\u2014such as buying or selling a home, withdrawing money from an account, or running a business\u2014a general power of attorney is more broad.\n", "\nA general power of attorney grants the agent the legal right to make all financial and legal decisions on behalf of the principal. An individual who\u00a0will be out of the country for a year may give an agent extensive powers to carry out\u00a0transactions such as\u00a0personal and business financial transactions, bill payments, life insurance purchases, charitable donations, real estate management,\u00a0and the filing of tax returns.\n", "\nA power of attorney becomes ineffective if its principal dies or becomes incapacitated, meaning the principal is unable to grant such power due to an injury or mental illness. However, a special power of attorney can be made durable.\n", "\nA <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hcpa.asp\">durable power of attorney</a> is one that authorizes the agent to continue acting on behalf of the principal even after the principal becomes incapacitated, for instance, due to a head injury or Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Under a durable power of attorney, the authority of the agent to act and make decisions on behalf of the principal continues until the principal's death. For\u00a0an individual who does not already have a durable power of attorney in place\u00a0and does not have the capacity to execute a special power of attorney, the court will impose a conservatorship or a guardianship to act on their behalf.\n", "\nWhen an individual passes away, the special power of attorney becomes void, and a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/last-will-and-testament.asp\">last will and testament</a> takes precedence.\n"]}
