It is a clarification of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rule10b5.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rule 10b-5</a> (sometimes written as Rule 10b5), created under the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/seact1934.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Securities and Exchange Act of 1934</a>, which is the primary vehicle for investigation of securities fraud.\n", "\nRule 10b5-1 permits major holders to sell a predetermined number of shares at a predetermined time. Many corporate executives use 10b5-1 plans to avoid accusations of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insidertrading.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">insider trading</a>.\n", "\nRule 10b5-1 allows company <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insider.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">insiders</a> to make predetermined trades <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/02/061202.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">while following insider trading laws</a> and avoiding insider trading accusations. It is recommended that companies permit an executive to either adopt or amend a 10b5-1 plan when its executives are allowed to trade the securities in tandem with their insider trading policy. Rule 10b5-1 stops any insiders from changing or adopting a plan if they are in possession of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/materialinsiderinformation.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">material nonpublic information</a> (MNPI).\n", "\nIt is not uncommon to see a major <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholder.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">shareholder</a> sell some of their shares at regular intervals. A director of XYZ Corporation, for example, may choose to sell 5,000 shares of stock on the second Wednesday of every month. To avoid conflict, Rule 10b5-1 plans must be established when the individual is unaware of any MNPI. These plans usually exist as a contract between the insider and their <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/broker.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">broker</a>.\n", "\nUnder Rule 10b5-1, directors and other major insiders in the company\u2014large shareholders, officers, and others who have access to MNPI\u2014can establish a written plan that details when they can buy or sell shares at a predetermined time on a scheduled basis. It is set up this way so that they are able to make these transactions when they are not in the vicinity of MNPI. This also allows companies to utilize 10b5-1 plans in large stock <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/buyback.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">buybacks</a>.\n", "\nFor insiders to enter into a Rule 10b5-1 plan, they must not have any access to MNPI regarding anything about the company as well the company\u2019s <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">securities</a>.
