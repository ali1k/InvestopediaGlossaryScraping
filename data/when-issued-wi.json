Orders, when issued, are sometimes called orders \"with ice\" or orders \"when distributed.\" The term is short for \"when, as, and if issued.\"\n", "\nSecurities trade on a when-issued basis when they have been announced but not yet issued. The transaction is settled only after the security has been issued. A when-issued market exists where when-issued instruments are traded.\n", "\nWhen-issued markets can provide an indication regarding the level of interest that a new issue may attract from investors.
