It was introduced by the Boston Consulting Group in 1970.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nThe BCG growth-share matrix breaks down products into four categories, known heuristically as \"dogs,\" \"cash cows,\" \"stars,\" and \u201cquestion marks.\u201d Each category quadrant has its own set of unique characteristics.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nIf a company\u2019s product has a low <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketshare.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">market share</a> and is at a low rate of growth, it is considered a \u201cdog\u201d and should be sold, liquidated, or repositioned. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dog.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dogs</a>, found in the lower right quadrant of the grid, don't generate much cash for the company since they have low market share and little to no growth. Because of this, dogs can turn out to be cash traps, tying up company funds for long periods of time.

Cash cows, seen in the lower left quadrant, are typically leading products in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/matureindustry.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">markets that are mature</a>.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nGenerally, these products generate returns that are higher than the market's growth rate and sustain itself from a cash flow perspective. These products should be taken advantage of for as long as possible. The value of cash cows can be easily calculated since their cash flow patterns are highly predictable. In effect, low-growth, high-share cash cows should be milked for cash to reinvest in high-growth, high-share \u201cstars\u201d with high <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earning-potential.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">future potential</a>.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nProducts that are in high growth markets and that make up a sizable portion of that market are considered \u201cstars\u201d and should be invested in more.

Question marks are in the upper right portion of the grid. They typically grow fast but consume large amounts of company resources.

For example, increasing market share may be more expensive than the additional revenue gain from new sales. Because product development may take years, businesses must plan for contingencies carefully.\n"]}
