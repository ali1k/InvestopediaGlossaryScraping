These instruments require fixed payments and are directly issued to the market with\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maturity.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">maturities</a> that are less than five years. EMTNs allow an issuer to enter the foreign markets more easily to obtain\u00a0capital. Firms also offer\u00a0EMTNs\u00a0continuously, whereas a bond issue, for example, occurs all at once.\n", "\nEMTN\u00a0issuers must maintain a standardized document known as a program. The\u00a0program can be transferred across all issues and has a high proportion of sales through predetermined syndication of buyers. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mtn.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Medium-term notes</a> (MTNs)\u2014notes that bear the same definition as EMTNs, but trade within the United States\u00a0and Canada\u2014must maintain a different program.\n", "\nOver the past 10 to 15 years, medium-term notes have emerged as a significant funding source for U.S. and foreign companies, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/supranational.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">supranational</a> institutions, federal agencies,\u00a0and sovereign nations. The United States has been issuing MTNs since the beginning of the 1970s\u00a0after\u00a0introducing\u00a0the debt instruments as an alternative to short-term financing in the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commercialpaper.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">commercial paper</a> market and long-term borrowing in the bond market. They named these instruments \"medium-term\" because\u00a0they serve the\u00a0middle ground.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nMTNs did not gain much momentum until the 1980s\u00a0when the MTN market shifted from an\u00a0obscure corner of the market\u2014heavily exploited by auto finance companies\u2014to a fundamental source of debt financing for hundreds of major corporations.\u00a0Outside the United States, the EMTN market has grown phenomenally and continues to attract new and booming businesses and industries.\n", "\nEMTNs offer diversity as companies can issue them\u00a0in a wide range of currencies and with\u00a0various maturities, typically, up to 30 years\u00a0although some may have a much longer maturity. Firms can issue\u00a0EMTNs\u00a0in collateralized, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/frn.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">floating rate</a> (FRN), amortizing, and credit-supported forms. Single issues from an\u00a0EMTN\u00a0program are comparable to a\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eurobond.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Eurobond</a> or a Euro note.\n", "\nInternational Security Identification Numbers (ISINs) and common codes are 12-digit security identification numbers.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff For EMTNs, a specific type of ISIN code is required. The agent of the EMTN program would normally obtain the ISIN numbers and common codes for the relevant EMTN notes on behalf of the issuer.\u00a0\n", "\nThe diversity and flexibility EMTNs offer are two of their many benefits. Another benefit\u00a0is savings. Fixed costs for\u00a0underwriting make it impractical for corporate bonds to make small offerings;\u00a0therefore, bonds typically amount to more than $100 million. Conversely, drawdowns from EMTN programs\u2014over one month\u2014typically\u00a0amount to $30 million. These drawdowns often have varying maturities and specialized features\u00a0tailored to meet the borrower's needs.\n", "\nOne example of an EMTN program is that of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www.telenor.com/investors/debt-financing/emtn-programme/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Telenor</a>; the program was established in 1996.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff This EMTN program is updated annually and constitutes a standardized master agreement for the issuance of bonds, including private placements and public benchmark bonds.\n"]}
