Tappan handed the reins of the company to Benjamin Douglass in the latter part of the decade. The company was reincorporated under the name R.G. Dun &amp; Co. in 1859 when Robert Graham Dun purchased it. In 1931, the company purchased the National Credit Office and was reorganized, becoming R.G. Dun &amp; Corp.\n", "\nJohn Bradstreet formulated and established the Bradstreet Co. in Cincinnati in 1849.

In 1964, D&amp;B published a codebook with the individual codes of all the companies that had received them and continued this until 1968. These numbers made an appearance, for the first time, in the <em>Million Dollar Directory</em> in 1969.\n", "\nThe DUNS system is composed of nine digits and is assigned to every business location in the D&amp;B database.
