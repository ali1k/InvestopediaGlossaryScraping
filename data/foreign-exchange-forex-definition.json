For example, one can swap the U.S. dollar for the euro.

Foreign exchange can be as simple as changing one currency for another at a local bank. It can also involve trading currency on the foreign exchange market. For example, a trader is betting a central bank will ease or tighten <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/monetary-policy/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">monetary policy</a> and that one currency will strengthen versus the other.\n", "\nWhen <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/08/forex-concepts.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">trading currencies</a>, they are listed in pairs, such as USD/CAD, EUR/USD, or USD/JPY.

If this price was associated with the USD/CAD pair, it means that it costs 1.2569 CAD to buy one USD. If the price increases to 1.3336, then it now costs 1.3336 CAD to buy one USD. The USD has increased in value (CAD decrease) because it now costs more CAD to buy one USD.\n", "\nIn the forex market currencies trade in\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0412/the-basics-of-currency-trading.aspx\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lots</a>, called micro, mini, and standard lots. A micro lot is 1,000 worth of a given currency, a mini lot is 10,000, and a standard lot is 100,000. This is different than when you go to a bank and want $450 exchanged for your trip. When trading in the electronic forex market, trades take place in set blocks of currency, but you can trade as many blocks as you like. For example, you can trade seven micro lots (7,000) or three mini lots (30,000) or 75 standard lots (7,500,000), for example.\n", "\nThe foreign exchange market is unique for several reasons, mainly because of its size.\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volumeoftrade.asp\">Trading volume</a>\u00a0in the forex\u00a0market is generally very\u00a0large.

Next, there's no cutoff as to when you can and cannot trade. Because the market is open 24 hours a day, you can trade at any time of day. Finally, because it's such a liquid market, you can get in and out whenever you want and you can buy as much currency as you can afford.\n", "\nSpot for most currencies is two business days; the major exception is the U.S. dollar versus the Canadian dollar, which settles on the next\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/business-day.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">business day</a>. Other pairs settle in two business days. During periods that have multiple holidays, such as Easter or Christmas, spot transactions can take as long as six days to settle. The price is established on the trade date, but money is exchanged on the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valuedate.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">value date</a>.\n", "\nThe U.S. dollar is the most actively traded currency.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff The most common pairs are the USD versus the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/euro.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">euro</a>, Japanese yen, British pound and Australian dollar.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"5\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff Trading pairs that do not include the dollar are referred to as crosses.
