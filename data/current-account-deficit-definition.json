The current account includes net income, such as interest and dividends, and\u00a0transfers, such as foreign aid, although these components make up only a small percentage of the total current account. The current account represents\u00a0a country\u2019s foreign transactions and, like\u00a0the capital account, is a component of a country\u2019s <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bop.asp\">balance of payments</a> (BOP).\n", "\nA country can reduce its existing debt by increasing the value of its exports relative to the value of imports. It can place restrictions on imports, such as tariffs or quotas, or it can emphasize policies that promote export, such as import substitution, industrialization, or policies that improve domestic companies' global competitiveness. The country can also use monetary policy to improve the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/forex/how-forex-exchange-rates-set.asp\">domestic currency\u2019s valuation</a> relative to other currencies through devaluation, which reduces the country\u2019s export costs.\u00a0\n", "\nWhile an existing deficit can imply that a country is spending\u00a0beyond\u00a0its means, having a current account deficit is not inherently disadvantageous. If a country uses external debt to finance investments that have higher returns than the interest rate on the debt, the country can remain solvent while running a current account deficit. If a country is unlikely to cover current debt levels with future revenue streams, however, it may become insolvent.\n", "\nA current account deficit represents negative net sales abroad. Developed countries, such as the United States, often run deficits while emerging economies often run current account surpluses. Impoverished countries tend to run current account debt.\n", "\nFluctuations in\u00a0a country's current account are largely dependent on market forces. Even countries that purposefully run deficits have volatility in the\u00a0deficit. The United Kingdom, for example, saw a decrease in its existing deficit after\u00a0the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brexit.asp\">Brexit</a> vote results in 2016.\n", "\nThe United Kingdom has traditionally run a deficit because it is a country that uses high levels of debt to finance excessive imports. A large portion of the country's exports are commodities, and declining commodity prices have resulted in lower earnings for domestic companies. This reduction translates to less income flowing back into the United Kingdom, increasing its current account deficit.\n", "\nHowever, after the British pound declined in value as a result of the Brexit vote that was held on June 23, 2016, the weaker pound\u00a0decreased the nation's\u00a0existing debt. This decrease occurred because overseas dollar earnings were\u00a0higher for domestic commodity companies, resulting in more cash inflows to the country.\n"]}
