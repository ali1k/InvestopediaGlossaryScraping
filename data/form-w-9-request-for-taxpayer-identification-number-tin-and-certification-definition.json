You would enter that name here. As for the disregarded entity part, if you don\u2019t know what it is, you probably aren't one. A common disregarded entity type is a single-member\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/llc.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">limited liability company</a>.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\u00a0Sole proprietorships\u00a0and\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/subchapters.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">S corporations</a>\u00a0are never classified as disregarded entities.\n", "\nWhat type of business entity are you for federal tax classification: sole proprietorship, partnership,\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/c-corporation.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">C corporation</a>, S corporation, trust/estate, limited liability company, or \"other\"?

Chances are you\u2019re going to leave these boxes blank. Here are a couple of exceptions:\u00a0\n", "\nProvide your street address, city, state, and zip code. What if your home address is different from your business address? Which address should you provide on Form W-9? Use the address that you will use on your tax return. For example, if you're a sole proprietor who rents office space, but you file your tax return using your home address, enter your home address on form W-9 so the IRS won\u2019t have trouble matching your 1099s with your\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/1040.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Form 1040</a>.\n", "\nIn this optional step, you can provide the requester's name and address. You might want to fill out this box to keep a record of to whom you provided your tax identification number.\n", "\nThe IRS calls this section Part I, which has to make you wonder what all those steps you just completed were. Here, you must provide your business's tax identification number, which will either be your individual\u00a0Social Security Number if you\u2019re a sole proprietorship, or your\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/employer-identification-number.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">employer identification number</a> (EIN)\u00a0if you're another type of business. Now, some sole proprietorships also have EINs, but the IRS\u00a0prefers that sole proprietors use their SSNs on Form W-9. Again, doing so will make it easier to match any 1099s you receive with your tax return, which you will file under your SSN.\n", "\nWhat if your business is new and doesn't have an EIN? You can still fill out a W-9 form. The IRS says you should apply for your number and write \"applied for\" in the space for the TIN. You\u2019ll want to get this number as quickly as possible\u00a0because, until you do, you\u2019ll be subject to backup withholding. You can apply for an EIN at the IRS website.\u00a0See the instructions below for Step 8, Part II, for more on <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/backupwithholding.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">backup withholding</a>.\n", "\nIn Part II, you must attest to the truthfulness of all of your information before you can sign Form W-9. Intentionally lying on a tax form could mean\u00a0you\u2019ll have to pay a fine or go to jail; the IRS doesn't mess around. Before signing form W-9, here are the statements you must certify are true, under penalty of perjury:\n", "\n<strong>1. The number shown on this form is my correct taxpayer identification number (or I am waiting for a number to be issued to me).</strong>\n", "\n<strong>2.\u00a0I am not subject to backup withholding because: (a) I am exempt from backup withholding, or (b) I have not been notified by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that I am subject to backup withholding as a result of a failure to report all interest or dividends, or (c) the IRS has notified me that I am no longer subject to backup withholding.</strong>\n", "\n<strong>3. I am a U.S. citizen or other U.S. person.</strong>\n", "\n<strong>4.\u00a0The FATCA code(s) entered on this form (if any) indicating that I am exempt from FATCA reporting is correct.</strong>\n", "\nForm W-9 tells you to cross out item 2 above if you have been notified by the IRS that you are currently subject to backup withholding because you have failed to report all interest and dividends on your tax return.\n", "\nYou may cross out item 2 if you're filling out Form W-9 in connection with a real estate transaction. Item 2 doesn\u2019t apply in this case, so it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re subject to backup withholding.\n", "\nNow, if you read the\u00a0fine print\u00a0in the W-9 instructions carefully, it seems to indicate that most people aren\u2019t required to sign this form at all. You're generally only required to sign it if the IRS has notified you that you previously provided an incorrect TIN. Technicalities aside, however, the person who asked you to fill out Form W-9 will probably consider it incomplete or invalid if you haven\u2019t signed it.\n", "\nReturn your completed Form W-9 to the business that asked you to fill it out. Ideally, you'll deliver it in person to limit your exposure to\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/identitytheft.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">identity theft</a>, but this method often isn't practical. Mail is considered relatively secure. If you must email the form, you should encrypt both the document and your email message and triple-check that you have the recipient\u2019s correct email address before sending your message. Free services are available online to help you do this, but check their reputations before trusting your documents to them. Typically the business that needs to submit a W-9 to the IRS will give you one to fill out.\n"]}
