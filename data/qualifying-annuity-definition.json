These annuities can be fixed, indexed, or variable\u00a0depending upon the plan sponsor's investment objectives. According to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/erisa.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Employee Retirement Income Security Act</a>\u00a0(ERISA) guidelines, contributions made into a qualifying annuity are tax-deductible unless the plan or annuity has a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rothira.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Roth</a> feature.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff <span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nQualifying annuities are not tax-deductible plans in and of themselves; they must reside within a qualified plan or IRA to enjoy this status. Qualifying annuities can be either the sole vehicle inside the plan or account, or they can be one of several other choices that are offered as well.\n", "\nIn many cases, the qualifying annuity is a variable contract and is the only vehicle offered within the plan, with the variable subaccounts constituting the choices available to plan participants.\n", "\nThe products that go into qualified and non-qualified annuities are the same. However, the rules for non-qualified annuities are different, which is covered in IRS <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irs-pub-575.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">publication 575</a>. One twist is that when a\u00a0non-qualified annuity is partially or fully <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/surrender-period.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">surrendered</a>, the first dollars out are considered earnings for tax purposes and are thus taxed at ordinary income rates. Once\u00a0all\u00a0of the earnings have been withdrawn, the remaining money\u2014the original investment\u2014can be taken out\u00a0tax-free.\n", "\nIf payments under a non-qualified plan are taken in the form of periodic payments, part\u00a0of each payment is treated as a return of the original investment for which no taxes are due. Part of the payout\u00a0is considered <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earnings.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">earnings</a> and taxed at ordinary income rates. The exact percentages of earnings versus principal are based on the type of payout and the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beneficiary.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">beneficiary's</a> age.\u00a0\n", "\nAnnuities can be structured generally as either fixed or variable.\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixedannuity.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fixed annuities</a>\u00a0provide regular periodic payments to the annuitant.\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/variableannuity.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Variable annuities</a>\u00a0allow the owner to receive more significant future cash flows if investments within the annuity fund do well and smaller payments if its investments do poorly. This provides for less stable cash flow than a fixed annuity but allows the annuitant to reap the benefits of strong returns from their fund's investments.\n", "\nThere are many other considerations, including sales fees,\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commission.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">commissions</a>, and the length of the annuity. Whether an annuity is qualified or not, withdrawals before age 59\u00bd are subject to a 10% penalty. Since the non-qualified annuity is purchased with after-tax dollars, only the earnings would be subject to the penalty.\n"]}
