Has operating cash flow turned negative because the company is investing in its operations to make them even more profitable? Or does the company need an injection of outside capital to buy time to continue operating in a desperate attempt to turn around the business?\n", "\nJust as companies can improve operating cash flow margin by using <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/workingcapital.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">working capital</a> more efficiently, they can also temporarily flatter operating cash flow margin by delaying the payment of accounts payable, chasing customers for payment or running down inventory.

This similar to operating cash flow margin except it uses operating income. Operating cash flow margin uses operating cash flow and not operating income.\n", "\nFree cash flow margin is another cash margin measure, where it also adds in capital expenditures. In capital intensive industries, with a high ratio of fixed to variable costs, a small increase in sales can lead to a large increase in operating cash flows, thanks to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operatingleverage.asp\">operational leverage</a>.\n", "\nOperating Cash Flow = Net Income + Non-cash Expenses (Depreciation and Amortization) + Change in Working Capital\n", "\nAssuming company ABC recorded the following information for 2018 business activities:\n", "\nSales = $5,000,000\n", "\nDepreciation = $100,000\n", "\nAmortization = $125,000\n", "\nOther Non-cash Expenses = $45,000\n", "\nWorking Capital = $1,000,000\n", "\nNet Income = $2,000,000\n", "\nAnd recorded the following information for 2019\u2019s business activities:\n", "\nSales = $5,300,000\n", "\nDepreciation = $110,000\n", "\nAmortization = $130,000\n", "\nOther Non-cash Expenses = $55,000\n", "\nWorking Capital = $1,300,000\n", "\nNet Income = $2,100,000\n", "\nWe calculate the cash flow from operating activities for the 2019 as:\n", "\nCash Flow From Operating Activities = $2,100,000 + ($110,000 + $130,000 + $55,000) + ($1,300,000 - $1,000,000) = $2,695,000\n", "\nTo arrive at the operating cash flow margin, this number is divided by sales:\n", "\nOperating Cash Flow Margin = $2,695,000 / $5,300,000 = 50.8%\n"]}
