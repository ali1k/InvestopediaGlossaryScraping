This period is often characterized by heavy volumes as traders close out options and futures contracts before expiry. Positions are then often re-opened in contracts that expire at a later date.\n", "\nThe witching hour is the final hour of trading in a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/12/derivative.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">derivatives</a> contract before it finally expires. More often traders will use terms such as \"<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/triplewitchinghour.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">triple witching</a>\", which refers to the expiration of stock options, index futures options, and index futures on the same day. This event occurs on the third Friday of March, June, September, and December.\n", "\nBecause <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/singlestockfuture.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">single stock futures</a> also expire on the same triple witching schedule, the terms quadruple and triple witching are used interchangeably. The <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/doublewitching.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">double witching</a> hour, meanwhile,\u00a0occurs on the third Friday of the eight months that aren't triple witching. On double witching, the expiring contracts are typically options on stocks and stock indexes.\n", "\nThe activity that takes place during monthly witching hours can be broken down into two categories: rolling out or closing <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expirationdate.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">expiring contracts</a> to avoid the expiration\u00a0and purchases of the underlying asset. Due to the imbalances that can occur as these trades are being placed, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/arbitrageur.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">arbitrageurs</a> also seek opportunities resulting from pricing inefficiencies.\n", "\nThe primary reason for escalated activity on witching hour days is contracts that are not closed out may result in the purchase or sale of the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underlying-security.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">underlying security</a>. For example, futures contracts that are not closed\u00a0require the seller to deliver the specified quantity of the underlying security or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commodity.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">commodity</a> to the buyer of the contract.\n", "\nOptions that are <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inthemoney.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">in-the-money</a> (ITM) may result in the underlying asset being exercised and assigned to the contract owner. In both cases, if the\u00a0contract owner or contract <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/writing-an-option.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">writer</a> is not in a position to pay the full value of the security to be delivered, the contract has to be closed out prior to expiration.\n", "\nRolling out\u00a0or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rollforward.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">rolling forward</a>, on the other hand, is when a position in the expiring contract is closed and re-opened into a contract expiring at a later date. The trader closes the expiring position, settling the gain or loss, and then opens a new position at the current market rate in a different contract. This process creates volume in the expiring contract and the contracts the traders are moving into.\n", "\nIn addition to the increased <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volume.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">volume</a> related to the offsetting of contracts during witching hours, the last hour of trading can also result in price <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inefficientmarket.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">inefficiencies</a> and, with it, potential arbitrage opportunities. Due to heavy volume coming in over a short time frame, opportunistic traders seek imbalances in supply and demand.\n", "\nFor example, contracts representing large <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/short.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">short positions</a> may be bid higher\u00a0if traders expect the contracts to be purchased to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/closeposition.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">close positions</a> prior to expiration. Under these circumstances, traders may sell contracts at temporarily high prices and then close them out prior to the end of the witching hour. Alternatively, they might buy the contract to ride the up wave, then sell\u00a0once the buying frenzy slows down.\n"]}
