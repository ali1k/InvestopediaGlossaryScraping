Companies and individuals chiefly under report their incomings in an effort to avoid or reduce their respective <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxliability.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tax liabilities</a>.\n", "\nUnder reporting is not a victimless crime. In fact, the billions of dollars of tax-loss revenue caused by under reporting reduces the funds the federal government relies on to finance <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/socialsecurity.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Social Security</a>, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/medicare.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Medicare</a>, and a host of other programs.\n", "\nIf a struggling <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/publiccompany.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">public company</a> experiences a sharp drop in its share price, it may report even lower <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/revenue.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">revenues</a> for a fiscal quarter than it actually earned during that time period. This is done merely for optical purposes. The trick is to hide revenues and then subsequently lump those hidden figures with the revenues in the following quarter's earnings statement, so that onlookers are led to believe that the company has rebounded and is now in much better shape.\n", "\nThe appearance of a more successful <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quarter.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">quarter</a> can inspire investors, and ultimately boost a company's stock price. Naturally, this form of under reporting is also an illegal practice.\n", "\nCompanies listed on stock exchanges aren't the only culprits. In fact, in most cases, it's usually <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/self-employed.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">self-employed</a> filers and those who earn cash income that are most likely to under report their incomes. The primary goal here is to reduce tax liabilities and pocket a higher percentage of any money made.\n", "\nDuring the 1990s, the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irs.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Internal Revenue Service</a> (IRS) estimated that as much as 84% of cash tips, worth hundreds of millions of dollars each year, were going unreported. And in 2019, the U.S. tax authority revealed that under reporting accounted for about $352 billion of the United States' $441 billion tax gap\u2014the difference between taxes owed and taxes actually paid\u2014in the 2011-2013 <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxyear.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tax years</a>.\n", "\nIndividuals and companies that are caught under reporting may be subject to fiscal penalties, and in extreme cases, might even face criminal charges.\n", "\nHowever, it's important to remember that under reporting is only a crime if offenders willfully disregard the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tax-code.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tax code</a>. If this action occurs due to negligence or calculation errors, the IRS could penalize the under reporting company or individual without initiating criminal action against those parties.\n", "\nFor example, if a waitress one night distractedly back pockets a few bills, rather than consolidating them with the rest of her take, this act of negligence won't likely result in criminal punishment. Only if investigators determine that willful <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxevasion.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tax evasion</a> or fraud has occurred will that waitress be at risk of a felony conviction.\n"]}
