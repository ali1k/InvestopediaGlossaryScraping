Once the insurer determines the value of its policy reserves, the company can calculate the valuation premium that will cover its liabilities.

Higher valuation premiums tend to correspond with higher risks and values of covered assets or items.\n", "\nAt times, an insurance company may opt to set a premium lower than the calculated valuation premium if its experience and statistical records indicate that a lower premium is justified. If a lower premium is charged, the insurance company would be obligated to hold the difference in a deficiency reserve.\n"]}
