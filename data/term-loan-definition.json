Conversely, a variable-rate loan's payment amount can vary since the interest rate can fluctuate. A lender may establish an SBA loan with interest-only payments during a company's startup or expansion phase. As a result, the business has time to generate income before making full loan payments.

An intermediate-term loan generally runs more than one\u2014but less than three\u2014years and is paid in monthly installments from a company\u2019s cash flow.
