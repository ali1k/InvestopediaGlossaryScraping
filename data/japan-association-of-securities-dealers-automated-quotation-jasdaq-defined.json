In 1991, this system was converted to an electronic market and rebranded as the Jasdaq Securities Exchange in 2004. This transition was pivotal for the Jasdaq, as it marked its formal recognition as a stock exchange. Prior to 2004, the Jasdaq facilitated OTC trades but did not hold a formal stock exchange license from the government.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff\n", "\nToday, the Jasdaq forms part of a robust ecosystem of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/04/092404.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">stock exchanges</a> operating in Japan, which include the Osaka Securities Exchange (OSE), the Nagoya Stock Exchange, the Sapporo Stock Exchange, the Fukuoka Stock Exchange, and the so-called Mothers exchange, which focuses on small and emerging companies and owes its name to the phrase \"Market of the high-growth and emerging stocks.\"\n", "\nAs has been true in many countries, Japan's stock exchanges have undergone a series of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consolidation.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">consolidations</a> in recent years.
