Unlike normal insurance, this insurance can be bought from an insurer not licensed in the insured\u2019s state. However, the surplus lines insurer requires a license in the state where it is based.\n", "\nSurplus lines insurance carries\u00a0additional risk for the policyholder as\u00a0there is no guaranty fund from which to obtain a claim payment if\u00a0the surplus line insurer goes bankrupt as is the case with standard insurance policies. A policyholder\u2019s claim on a regular insurance policy is often paid out of a\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stateguarantyfund.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">state guaranty\u00a0fund</a>\u00a0to which all regular state companies contribute to in case one insurer goes bankrupt.\n", "\nThe surplus lines insurance market is heavily dominated by the United Kingdom\u2019s Lloyd\u2019s of London. Data from the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www.iii.org/publications/a-firm-foundation-how-insurance-supports-the-economy/driving-economic-progress/surplus-lines\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Insurance Information Institute</a> shows Lloyd\u2019s with 24% of the surplus lines market and $11.8 billion in direct premiums. Following Lloyd\u2019s, surplus lines market share drops of to the single digits with the top 25 surplus lines insurers.\n", "\nExamples of other top-25 surplus lines insurers include American International Group (AIG), Markel Corporation Group, Nationwide Group, W. R. Berkley Insurance Group, Berkshire Hathaway Insurance Group, Chubb INA Group, Fairfax Financial (USA) Group, and Liberty Mutual.\n", "\nOne example of a common surplus lines insurance classification is flood insurance. Lloyd\u2019s\u00a0offers this insurance through the Natural\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/catastrophe-insurance.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Catastrophe Insurance</a>\u00a0Program, which offers an alternative to the Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s (FEMA) flood insurance. Consumers who find FEMA\u2019s insurance too expensive might find a more affordable policy through surplus lines insurance.\n", "\nSurplus lines cover high limit and hard-to-place risks. Surplus lines work alongside wholesale and specialty insurances to help cover non-standard risks and those with unusual underwriting characteristics.\n", "\nRegular insurance carriers also called standard or admitted carriers, must follow state regulations concerning how much they can charge and what risks they can and cannot cover. Surplus lines carriers do not have to follow these regulations, which allows them to take on higher risks.\n", "\nA surplus lines insurer is sometimes referred to as a non-admitted or unlicensed carrier, but this does not mean their policies\u00a0aren\u2019t valid. The designation only means they are subject to different regulations from those that govern admitted or standard carriers.\n", "\nInsurers outside the U.S., called alien insurers, make up much of the surplus lines market. As mentioned, Lloyd\u2019s of London writes most of the insurance for alien surplus lines, while other insurers in the U.K. make up the bulk of the rest of the surplus lines market.\n"]}
