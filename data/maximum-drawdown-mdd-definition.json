However, it's important to note that it only measures the size of the largest loss, without taking into consideration the frequency of large losses. Because it measures only the largest drawdown, MDD does not indicate how long it took an investor to recover from the loss, or if the investment even recovered at all.\n", "\nMaximum drawdown (MDD) is an indicator used to assess the relative riskiness of one <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockscreener.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">stock screening</a> strategy versus another, as it focuses on <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/preservationofcapital.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">capital preservation</a>, which is a key concern for most investors. For example, two screening strategies can have the same average outperformance, tracking error, and volatility, but their maximum drawdowns compared to the benchmark can be very different.\n", "\nA low maximum drawdown is preferred as this indicates that losses from investment were small. If an investment never lost a penny, the maximum drawdown would be zero. The worst possible maximum drawdown would be -100%, meaning the investment is completely worthless.\n", "\nMDD should be used in the right perspective to derive the maximum benefit from it. In this regard, particular attention should be paid to the time period being considered. For instance, a hypothetical long-only U.S. fund Gamma has been in existence since 2000 and had a maximum drawdown of -30% in the period ending 2010. While this may seem like a huge loss, note that the S&amp;P 500 had plunged more than 55% from its peak in October 2007 to its trough in March 2009. While other metrics would need to be considered to assess Gamma fund's overall performance, from the viewpoint of MDD, it has outperformed its benchmark by a huge margin.\n", "\nConsider an example to understand the concept of maximum drawdown. Assume an investment portfolio has an initial value of $500,000. The portfolio increases to $750,000 over a period of time, before plunging to $400,000 in a ferocious bear market. It then rebounds to $600,000, before dropping again to $350,000. Subsequently, it more than doubles to $800,000.
