Once the stock's adjusted cost basis has been reduced to zero, any subsequent return will be taxable as a capital gain.\n", "\nWhen an individual invests, they put the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/principal.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">principal</a> to work in hopes of generating a return\u2014an amount known as the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/costbasis.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cost basis</a>. When the principal is returned to an investor, that is the return of capital. Since it does not include gains (or losses), it is not considered taxable\u2014it is similar to getting your original money back.\n", "\nSome types of investments allow investors to first receive their capital back <em>before</em> receiving gains (or losses) for tax purposes. Examples include qualified retirement accounts such as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/401kplan.asp\">401(k)</a> plans or<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ira.asp\"> IRAs</a> and cash accumulated from permanent life insurance policies.

If an investor receives an amount that is less than or equal to the cost basis, the payment is a return of capital and not a capital gain.\n", "\nAssume, for example, that an investor buys 100 shares of XYZ common stock at $20 per share, and the stock has a 2-for-1 stock split so that the investor\u2019s adjusted holdings total 200 shares at $10 per share. If the investor sells the shares for $15, the first $10 is considered a return of capital and is not taxed. The additional $5 per share is a capital gain and is reported on the personal tax return.\n", "\nA partnership is defined as a business in which two or more people contribute <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp\">assets</a> and operate an entity to share in the profits. The parties create a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/partnership.asp\">partnership</a> using a partnership agreement.

The partner\u2019s interest is reduced by any withdrawals or guaranteed payments and by the partner\u2019s share of partnership losses. Withdrawal up to the partner\u2019s capital account balance is considered a return of capital and is not a taxable event.\n", "\nOnce the entire capital account balance is paid to the partner, however, any additional payments are considered income to the partner and are taxed on the partner\u2019s personal tax return.\n"]}
