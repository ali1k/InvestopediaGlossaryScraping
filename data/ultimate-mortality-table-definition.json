The first few years of life insurance data is usually removed from the analysis to eliminate so-called selection effects. The rationale here is that people who just received life insurance will often have passed a medical exam and, as a result, should be statistically healthier and less likely to be on the brink of death than the rest of the general population.\n", "\nThe information underlying ultimate mortality tables is called survivorship data and\u00a0takes into account many\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risk.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">risk</a> factors. Along with death and survival rates among age groups and sexes, mortality tables may also list survival and death rates in relation to weight, ethnicity, and region. Some break out statistics for smokers and non-smokers, too.\n", "\nIn addition, some might include an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aggregate-mortality-table.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">aggregate mortality table</a>, featuring death-rate data on the entire study population that has purchased life insurance, without a categorization based on age or time of purchase. The data in an aggregate table depends on the combined statistics of several, if not many, individual mortality tables.\n", "\nInsurance companies use data from ultimate mortality tables to price their products and determine whether to offer coverage to an applicant.\n", "\nLife insurance guarantees a lump sum payment to named <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beneficiary.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">beneficiaries</a> when the policyholder dies, so studying the probability that an applicant might pass away during the period he or she seeks coverage for is essential to ensure the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profit.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">profitability</a> of an insurance company.\n", "\nTo a lesser degree, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investment-management.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">investment-management</a> companies may also consult ultimate mortality tables to help their customers make determinations about their own respective life expectancies and how much money they might need in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/retirement.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">retirement</a>.\n", "\nAs is the case for other types of statistical data, the accuracy of ultimate mortality tables depends on the breadth of data in the survey. In other words, an\u00a0insurance company's ultimate mortality table\u00a0may not be\u00a0as precise as\u00a0one\u00a0compiled by an organization that's able to compile data sets from multiple insurers.\n", "\nFor instance, the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/society-actuaries-soa.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Society of Actuaries</a> (SOA)\u00a0typically produces an ultimate mortality table each year that is based on a fairly wide data set.
