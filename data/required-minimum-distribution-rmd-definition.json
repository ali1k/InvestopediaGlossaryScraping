You must begin withdrawing from a retirement account by April 1 following the year account holders reach age 72 (prior to 2020, the RMD age had been 70\u00bd years old). The retiree must then withdraw the RMD amount\u00a0each subsequent year based on the current RMD\u00a0calculation.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nA required minimum distribution (RMD) acts as a safeguard against people using a retirement account to avoid paying taxes. Required minimum distributions are determined by dividing the retirement account\u2019s prior year-end <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fairmarketvalue.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fair market value</a> (FMV) by the applicable distribution period or life expectancy.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"5\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has a worksheet to help taxpayers calculate the amount they must withdraw.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff Generally, your account custodian or plan administrator will calculate these amounts and report them to the IRS.\n", "\nSome qualified plans allow certain participants to defer the start of their RMDs until they actually retire, even if they are older than age 72.

April is nearing, and Bob\u2019s IRA is worth $225,000 and had a balance of $205,000 on Dec. 31 of the previous year.

However, for years following the account owner's death, your RMD depends on your identity as the designated beneficiary. For example, RMD rules may vary depending on whether you are a surviving spouse, minor child, or a disabled individual.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"5\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nGenerally, if you inherit an IRA from an account owner who died prior to Jan. 1, 2020, you would calculate your RMD using the IRS Single Life Table.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"8\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff However, if the account owner died after Dec. 31, 2019, you'll need to follow the RMD rules established by the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/secure-act-4688468\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SECURE Act</a>, which distinguishes between eligible designated beneficiaries, designated beneficiaries, and non-designated beneficiaries.
