A loan commitment is useful for consumers looking to buy a home or a business planning to make a major purchase.\n", "\nThe loan can take the form of a single lump sum or\u2014in the case of an open-end loan commitment\u2014a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lineofcredit.asp\">line of credit</a> that the borrower can draw upon as needed (up to a predetermined limit).\n", "\nFinancial institutions make loan commitments based on the borrower\u2019s <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-worthiness.asp\">creditworthiness</a> and\u2014in if it's a secured commitment\u2014on the value of some form of collateral. In the case of individual consumers, this collateral may be a home. Borrowers can then use the funds made available under the loan commitment, up to the agreed-upon limit. An open-end loan commitment works like a revolving line of credit: When the borrower pays back a portion of the loan's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/principal.asp\">principal</a>, the lender adds that amount back to the available loan limit.\n", "\nLoan commitments can be either secured or unsecured.\n", "\nA secured commitment is typically based on the borrower\u2019s creditworthiness and it has some form of collateral backing it. Two examples of open-end secured loan commitments for consumers are a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/securedcard.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">secured credit card</a>\u2013where money in a bank account serves as collateral\u2013and a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/heloc/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">home equity line of credit (HELOC)</a>\u2013in which the equity in a home is used as collateral.\n", "\nBecause the credit limit is typically based on the value of the secured asset, the credit limit is often higher for a secured loan commitment than for an unsecured loan commitment. In addition, the loan\u2019s interest rate may be lower and the payback time may be longer for a secured loan commitment than for an unsecured one. However, the approval process typically requires more paperwork and takes longer than with an unsecured loan.\n", "\nThe lender holds the collateral\u2019s deed or title\u2013or places a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lien.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lien</a> on the asset\u2013until the loan is completely paid. Defaulting on a secured loan may result in the lender assuming ownership of and selling the secured asset, at which point they would then be responsible for using the proceeds to cover the loan.\n", "\nA loan that doesn't have any collateral backing it is primarily based on the borrower\u2019s creditworthiness. An unsecured credit card is one very basic example of an unsecured open-end loan commitment. Typically, the higher the borrower\u2019s <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit_score.asp\">credit score</a>, the higher the credit limit.\n", "\nHowever, the interest rate may be higher than on a secured loan commitment because no collateral is backing the debt. Unsecured loans typically have a fixed minimum payment schedule and interest rate. The process for acquiring this type of loan often takes less paperwork and approval time than a secured loan commitment.\n", "\nOpen-end loan commitments are flexible and can be useful for paying unexpected <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shorttermdebt.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">short-term debt</a> obligations or covering financial emergencies. In addition, HELOCs typically have low interest rates, which may make their payments more affordable. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/best-secured-credit-cards-4801574\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Secured credit cards</a> can help consumers establish or rebuild their credit; paying their bill on time and keeping total credit card debt low will improve their credit scores, and in time they may be eligible for an unsecured credit card.\n", "\nThe downside of a secured loan commitment is that borrowers who take out too much money and are unable to repay the loan may have to forfeit their collateral. For example, this could mean losing their home. Unsecured commitments have a higher interest rate, which makes borrowing more expensive.\n"]}
