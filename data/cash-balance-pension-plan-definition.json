As in a traditional pension plan, investments are managed professionally, and participants are promised a certain benefit at retirement.

For the 2021 tax year, the maximum combined contribution is $64,500 ($63,500 for 2020).

At retirement, participants can take an annuity based on their account balance, or a lump sum, which can then be rolled into an IRA or another employer's plan.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"5\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nCash balance pension plans can be more costly to employers than 401(k) plans, in part because an actuary must certify each year that the plan is properly funded. Typical costs include $2,000 to $5,000 in setup fees, $2,000 to $10,000 in annual administration fees, and investment-management fees ranging from 0.25%\u00a0to 1%\u00a0of assets.\n"]}
