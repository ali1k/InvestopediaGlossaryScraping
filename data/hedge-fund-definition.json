For example, a manager overseeing a $1 billion fund could pocket $20 million a year in compensation without lifting a finger.\u00a0\n", "\nThat said, there are mechanisms put in place to help protect those who invest in hedge funds.

These guidelines can be based on absolute values, such as returns that exceed 20% per year over the previous five years, or they can be relative, such as the top five highest-performing funds in a particular category.\n", "\nFor a list of the biggest hedge funds in the world read, \"<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/investing/biggest-hedge-funds-world/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">What are the Biggest Hedge Funds in the World?</a>\"\n", "\nThe first guideline an investor should set when selecting a fund is the annualized\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rateofreturn.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">rate of return</a>.

Let's assume we add 1% to this result, and establish that value as the guideline for standard deviation. Funds with a standard deviation greater than the guideline can also be eliminated from further consideration.\n", "\nUnfortunately, high returns do not necessarily help to identify an attractive fund. In some cases, a hedge fund may have employed a strategy that was in favor, which drove performance to be higher than normal for its category. Therefore, once certain funds have been identified as high-return performers, it is important to identify the fund's strategy and compare its returns to other funds in the same category. To do this, an investor can establish guidelines by first generating a peer analysis of similar funds. For example, one might establish the\u00a050th\u00a0percentile as the guideline for filtering funds.\u00a0\n", "\nNow an investor has two guidelines that all funds need to meet for further consideration. However, applying these two guidelines still leaves too many funds to evaluate in a reasonable amount of time. Additional guidelines need to be established, but the additional guidelines will not necessarily apply across the remaining universe of funds. For example, the guidelines for a\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mergerarbitrage.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">merger arbitrage</a>\u00a0fund will differ from those for a long-short\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketneutral.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">market-neutral</a>\u00a0fund.\n", "\nTo facilitate the investor's search for high-quality funds that not only meet the initial return and risk guidelines but also meet strategy-specific guidelines, the next step is to establish a set of relative guidelines. Relative performance metrics should always be based on specific categories or strategies. For example, it would not be fair to compare a\u00a0leveraged\u00a0global macro fund with a market-neutral, long/short\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equityfund.asp#axzz1kxDvtIBY\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">equity fund</a>.\n", "\nTo establish guidelines for a specific strategy, an investor can use an analytical software package (such as Morningstar) to first identify a universe of funds using similar strategies.

Using the\u00a050th\u00a0percentile across all the metrics\u00a0usually\u00a0filters out all but a few hedge funds for additional consideration. In addition, establishing the guidelines this way allows for flexibility to adjust the guidelines as the economic environment may impact the absolute returns for some strategies.\n", "\nFactors used by some advocates of hedge funds include:\n", "\nThese guidelines will help eliminate many of the funds in the universe and identify a workable number of funds for further analysis.\n", "\nAn investor may also want to consider other guidelines that can either further reduce the number of funds to analyze or to identify funds that meet additional criteria that may be relevant to the investor.

Before the news was made public, Gupta allegedly passed on information that Warren Buffett was making an investment in Goldman Sachs in September 2008 at the height of the financial crisis.\u00a0Rajaratnam\u00a0was able to buy substantial amounts of Goldman Sachs stock and make a hefty profit on those shares in one day.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"13\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nRajaratnam\u00a0was also convicted on other insider trading charges. Throughout his tenure as a fund manager, he cultivated a group of industry insiders to gain access to material information.\n", "\nHedge funds are so big and powerful that the SEC is starting to pay closer attention, particularly because\u00a0breaches such as insider trading\u00a0and fraud seem to be occurring much more frequently. However, a recent act has actually loosened the way that hedge funds can market their vehicles to investors.\u00a0\n", "\nIn March 2012, the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jumpstart-our-business-startups-act-jobs.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act</a>\u00a0(JOBS Act) was signed into law. The basic premise of the JOBS Act was to encourage\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/09/start-business-in-depressed-economy.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">funding of small businesses</a>\u00a0in the U.S. by easing securities regulation. The JOBS Act also had a major impact on hedge funds: In September 2013, the ban on hedge fund advertising was lifted. In a 4-to-1 vote, the SEC approved a motion to allow hedge funds and other firms that create private offerings to\u00a0advertise\u00a0to whomever they want, although they still can only accept investments from\u00a0accredited investors. Hedge funds are often key suppliers of capital to startups and small businesses because of their wide investment latitude. Giving hedge funds the opportunity to solicit capital would in effect help the growth of small businesses by increasing the pool of available investment capital.\n", "\nHedge fund advertising entails offering the fund's\u00a0investment products\u00a0to accredited investors or\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financialintermediary.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">financial intermediaries</a>\u00a0through print, television, and the internet. A hedge fund that wants to solicit (advertise to) investors must file a \u201c<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-d.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Form D</a>\u201d with the SEC at least 15 days before it starts advertising. Because hedge fund advertising was strictly prohibited prior to lifting this ban, the SEC is very interested in how advertising is being used by private\u00a0issuers, so it has made changes to\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-d.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Form D</a>\u00a0filings. Funds that make public solicitations will also need to file an amended Form D within 30 days of the offering\u2019s termination. Failure to follow these rules will likely result in a ban from creating additional securities for a year or more.\n", "\nSince the 2008 crisis, the hedge fund world has entered into another period of less-than-stellar returns. Many funds that had previously enjoyed double-digit returns during an average year have seen their profits diminish significantly. In many cases, funds have failed to match the returns of the S&amp;P 500. For investors considering where to place their money, this becomes an increasingly easy decision: why suffer the high fees and initial investments, the added risk, and the withdrawal limitations of hedge funds if a safer, simpler investment like a mutual fund can produce returns that are the same or, in some cases, even stronger?\n", "\nThere are many reasons why hedge funds have struggled in recent years. These reasons run the gauntlet from geopolitical tensions around the globe to an over-reliance among many funds on particular sectors, including technology, and interest rate hikes by the Fed. Many prominent fund managers have made highly-publicized bad bets which have cost them not only monetarily but in terms of their reputations as savvy fund leaders, too.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/david-einhorn.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">David Einhorn</a> is an example of this approach. Einhorn's firm Greenlight Capital bet against Allied Capital early on and Lehman Brothers during the financial crisis. Those high-profile bets were successful and earned Einhorn the reputation of a shrewd investor.\n", "\nHowever, the firm posted losses of 34 percent, its worst year ever, in 2018 on the back of shorts against Amazon, which recently became the second trillion dollar company after Apple, and holdings in General Motors, which posted a less-than-stellar 2018.\n", "\nNotably, the overall size of the hedge fund industry (in terms of assets under management) has not declined significantly during this period and has continued to grow. There are new hedge funds launching all the time, even as several of the past 10 years have seen record numbers of hedge fund closures.\n", "\nIn the midst of growing pressures, some hedge funds are reevaluating aspects of their organization, including the \"Two and Twenty\" fee structure. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/hedge-funds-closed-down-last-year-at-a-pace-unseen-since-2008-2017-03-17\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">According to data from Hedge Fund Research</a>, the last quarter of 2016 saw the average management fee fall to 1.48%, while the average incentive fee fell to 17.4%. In this sense, the average hedge fund is still much more costly than, say, an index or mutual fund, but the fact that the fee structure is changing on average is notable.\n", "\nIn mid-2018, data provider HFM Absolute Return created a ranked list of hedge funds according to total AUM. This list of top hedge funds includes some companies which hold more in AUM in other areas besides a hedge fund arm. Nonetheless, the ranking factors in only the hedge fund operations at each firm.\n", "\nPaul Singer's Elliott Management Corporation held $35 billion in AUM as of the survey. Founded in 1977, the fund is occasionally described as a \"vulture fund,\" as roughly one-third of its assets are focused on distressed securities, including debt for bankrupt countries. Regardless, the strategy has proven successful for multiple decades.\n", "\nFounded in 2001 by David Siegel and John Overdeck, New York's Two Sigma Investments is near the top of the list of hedge funds by AUM, with more than $37 billion in managed assets. The firm was designed to not rely on a single investment strategy, allowing it to be flexible along with shifts in the market.\n", "\nOne of the most popular hedge funds in the world is James H. Simon's Renaissance Technologies. The fund, with $57 billion in AUM, was launched in 1982, but it has revolutionized its strategy along with changes in technology in recent years. Now, Renaissance is known for systematic trading based on computer models and quantitative algorithms. Thanks to these approaches, Renaissance has been able to provide investors with consistently strong returns, even in spite of recent turbulence in the hedge fund space more broadly.\n", "\nAQR Capital Investments is the second-largest hedge fund in the world, overseeing just under $90 billion in AUM as of the time of HFM's survey. Based in Greenwich, Connecticut, AQR is known for utilizing both traditional and alternative investment strategies.\n", "\nRay Dalio's Bridgewater Associates remains the largest hedge fund in the world, with just under $125 billion in AUM as of mid-2018. The Connecticut-based fund employs about 1700 people and focuses on a global macro investing strategy. Bridgewater counts foundations, endowments, and even foreign governments and central banks among its clientele.\n", "\nA hedge fund is a type of investment vehicle that caters to high-net-worth individuals, institutional investors, and other accredited investors. The term \u201chedge\u201d is used because hedge funds originally focused on strategies that hedged the risks faced by investors, such as by simultaneously buying and shorting shares in a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long-shortequity.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">long-short equity</a> strategy. Today, hedge funds offer a very wide range of strategies across practically all available asset classes, including real estate, derivatives, and non-traditional investments such as fine art and wine.\n", "\nAs a type of actively-managed investment fund, hedge funds are similar to other investment vehicles such as mutual funds, venture capital funds, and joint ventures. However, hedge funds are known for a few defining characteristics. First, they are more lightly regulated than competing products such as mutual funds or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">exchange-traded funds (ETFs)</a>, providing them with virtually unlimited flexibility in terms of the strategies and objectives they can pursue. Second, hedge funds have the reputation for being more expensive than other vehicles, with many hedge funds utilizing the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/two_and_twenty.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\u201c2 and 20\u201d</a> fee structure.\n", "\nBecause of their diversity, hedge funds can help investors accomplish a wide variety of investment objectives. For example, an investor might be attracted to a particular hedge fund because of the reputation of its managers, the specific assets in which the fund is invested, or the unique strategy that it employs. In some cases, the techniques used by hedge funds\u2014such as combining leverage with complex derivative transactions\u2014may not even be permitted by regulators if it were pursued by a mutual fund or another type of investment vehicle.\n"]}
