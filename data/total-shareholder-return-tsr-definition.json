A <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalgain.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">capital gain</a> is a change in the market price of the stock from the time it was purchased to the date it was sold (or the current price if it is still owned)\u2014profits, in other words. Current income is the dividends paid out by the company from its earnings while the investor still owns the stock.\n", "\nWhen calculating TSR, an investor can only consider the dividends they actually received or were eligible to receive.

Then add the dollar amount of dividends received per share, along with any other special distributions or payouts (like from a stock buyback, for example).
