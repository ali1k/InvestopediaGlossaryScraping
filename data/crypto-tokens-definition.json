These tokens represent fungible and tradable assets or utilities that reside on their own blockchains. Crypto tokens are often used to fundraise for crowd sales, but they can also be used as a substitute for other things. These tokens are usually created, distributed, sold, and circulated through the standard <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/initial-coin-offering-ico.asp\">initial coin offering</a> (ICO) process, which involves a crowdfunding exercise to fund project development.\n", "\nAs noted above, crypto tokens are cryptocurrency tokens.

Blockchains are special databases that store information in blocks that are then chained or linked together.\u00a0This means that crypto tokens, which are also called crypto <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp\">assets</a>, represent a certain unit of value.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\"></span>\n", "\nHere's how it all works. Crypto refers to the various encryption <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/algorithm.asp\">algorithms</a> and cryptographic techniques that safeguard these entries, such as elliptical curve encryption, public-private key pairs, and hashing functions.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\"></span> Cryptocurrencies, on the other hand, are systems that allow for secure payments online which are denominated in virtual tokens.

There can be another crypto token that gives entitlement to the token holder to view 10 hours of streaming content on a video-sharing blockchain.\u00a0Another crypto token may even represent other cryptocurrencies, such as a crypto token being equal to 15 bitcoins on a particular blockchain. Such crypto tokens are tradable and transferrable among the various participants of the blockchain.\n", "\nTokens are created through an initial coin offering, which represents the cryptocurrency version of an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ipo.asp\">initial public offering</a> (IPO).
