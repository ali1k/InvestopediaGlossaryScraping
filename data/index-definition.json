Indexes typically measure the performance of a basket of securities intended to replicate a certain area of the market.

In finance, it typically refers to a statistical measure of change in a securities market. In the case of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-market.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">financial markets</a>, stock and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bondmarket.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bond market</a> indexes consist of a hypothetical portfolio of securities representing a particular market or a segment of it.

In most cases, the relative change of an index is more important than the actual numeric value representing the index.

For instance, many mutual funds compare their returns to the return in the S&amp;P\u00a0500 Index to give investors a sense of how much more or less the managers are earning on their money than they would make in an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indexfund.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">index fund</a>.\n", "\n\"Indexing\" is a form of passive fund management.

However, rather than the fund sponsor trying to put together an investment portfolio likely to closely mimic the index in question, these securities feature a rate of return that follows a particular index but typically have caps on the returns they provide. For example, if an investor buys an annuity indexed to the Dow Jones and it has a cap of 10%, its rate of return will be between 0 and 10%, depending on the annual changes to that index. Indexed annuities allow investors to buy securities that grow along with broad market segments or the total market.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/arm.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Adjustable-rate mortgages</a> feature interest rates that adjust over the life of the loan. The adjustable interest rate is determined by adding a margin to an index.
