According to its creators, Obelisk also reduces the need for mining, significantly improves transaction speed, and delivers enhanced security.\n", "\nBlockchains operate globally as self-regulated, decentralized platforms without any single authority. A real-time, reliable, and secure network mechanism is required to ensure the authenticity of the\u00a0transactions occurring on the network, as well as a consensus on the ledger's status.\u00a0This role is performed by the consensus\u00a0algorithm. A consensus algorithm is a procedure through which all the participants in the blockchain network reach a\u00a0common agreement\u00a0about the present state of the distributed ledger.\u00a0\n", "\nWhile the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-work.asp\">proof of work (PoW)</a>\u00a0system\u2014used by bitcoin\u00a0and\u00a0litecoin\u2014and the <a class=\"pseudoStyle\" data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-stake-pos.asp\">proof of stake (PoS)</a> system\u2014used by Dash\u2014are the two most commonly used consensus algorithms, they both have some drawbacks. PoW is said to be energy-intensive, and PoS can promote cryptocurrency hoarding instead of spending.\n", "\nObelisk attempts to circumvent the problems of PoW and PoS by distributing influence over the network, according to a concept called a \u201cweb of trust.\u201d This concept distributes influence over\u00a0various network nodes and makes consensus decisions depending upon the influence score of each node. Each node subscribes to a select number of other network nodes, and the density of a node\u2019s subscriber network determines its influence on the network.\n", "\nIn terms of roles and activities performed, there are two types of nodes that participate in Obelisk: block-generating nodes and consensus nodes. Nodes can take either role; they are interchangeable. Block-generating nodes collect new transactions, authenticate them, package the verified\u00a0transactions in a new block, and then broadcast the block to the network.\n", "\nConsensus nodes collect the blocks generated by block-generating nodes and put them in a separate container (apart from the blockchain). It then identifies the block which was made by the largest number of block-generators.\u00a0This block is called the local winner and qualifies to be added to the blockchain. Each such consensus node maintains necessary statistics on local winners (as reported by other nodes).\n", "\nWhen local winners have been reported by the majority of the consensus nodes, it qualifies as a global winner and continues to remain a part of the blockchain. However, if the nodes decide otherwise, then it will take one of the following actions based on the available data and local logs:\n", "\nObelisk is used by <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/skycoin-sky-cryptocurrency.asp\">Skycoin</a>, the cryptocurrency of the Skycoin project.
