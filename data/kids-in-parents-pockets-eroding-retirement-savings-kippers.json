They like living with their adult children.\n", "\nHowever, it usually results in the parents spending more and saving less than they otherwise would as they approach retirement age. They may also postpone important life decisions such as downsizing their homes, moving to a better climate, or even retirement itself.\n", "\nContrast this to the situation of a married dual-income couple with no children at home, whose discretionary income is often higher and who find saving for retirement easier.
