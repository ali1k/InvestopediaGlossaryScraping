These organizations are typically created by legislative action, but may initially be set up by presidential order as well. The directors of these agencies are typically selected by presidential appointment.\n", "\nFederal agencies are created by the government to regulate industries or practices that require close oversight or specialized expertise. Some organizations, such as the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fdic.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</a> (FDIC) and the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/ginniemae.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Government National Mortgage Association</a> (GNMA), have their operations explicitly backed by the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/ustreasury.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">U.S. Treasury</a>.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff <span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff Other organizations, such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Sallie Mae are only provided with an implicit guarantee from the U.S. Treasury.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nA number of the organizations which are an actual part of the government issue securities such as stocks and bonds. These have been historically popular with investors. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/agencybonds.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Federal agency bonds</a>, which are bonds that are backed by the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/full-faith-credit.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">full faith and credit</a> of the United States government, are examples of federal agency securities. Investors expect to receive regular interest payments from holding an agency bond. At maturity, the full <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/facevalue.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">face value</a> of the agency bond is repaid to the bondholder. Because federal agency bonds are less liquid than <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurybond.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Treasury bonds</a>, they offer a slightly higher rate of interest than Treasury bonds. Federal agency bonds are issued by government agencies such as the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"5\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federal-housing-administration.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Federal Housing Administration</a> (FHA), <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"6\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/small-business-administration.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Small Business Administration</a> (SBA), and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"7\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/ginniemae.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Government National Mortgage Association</a> (GNMA or Ginnie Mae).<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"5\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff <span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nAnother type of bond issued by government agencies is the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gse.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">government-sponsored enterprise</a> (GSE) bond. These bonds are issued by corporations that are not quite part of the government but are set up by Congress to work for the common good of the country. These enterprises mostly operate on their own and are publicly held on the major exchanges. GSEs include the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/freddiemac.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Federal Home Loan Mortgage</a> (Freddie Mac), Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation, and the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fhlb.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Federal Home Loan Bank</a> (FHLB).<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff The government guarantee that applies to agency bonds does not apply to GSE bonds, which therefore have <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditrisk.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">credit risk</a> and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"5\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/defaultrisk.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">default risk</a>. For this reason, the yield on these bonds is typically higher than the yield on Treasury bonds.\n", "\nMortgage loans are backed by federal agency securities issued by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or the FHLB, and hold a very high credit rating. Agency securities are also used as collateral for the supply of money released by the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalreservebank.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Federal Reserve</a>. Sold by a nationwide group of banks and dealers, these securities raise money to fund public needs such as road building, low-cost housing, urban renewal, and also to provide low-interest rate loans to farmers, small business owners, and veterans.\n"]}
