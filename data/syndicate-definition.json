Syndication makes it easy for companies to pool their resources and share risks, as when <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/distributing-syndicate.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a group of investment banks</a> works together to bring a new issue of securities to the market. There are different types of syndicates, such as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underwriter-syndicate.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">underwriting syndicates</a>, banking syndicates, and insurance syndicates.\n", "\nSyndicates are usually comprised of companies in the same industry. For example, two pharmaceutical companies may combine their <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/randd.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">research and development (R&amp;D)</a> teams by creating a syndicate to develop a new drug. Or several real estate companies may form a syndicate to manage a large development. Sometimes <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/syndicatedloan.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">banks will form a syndicate to loan a very large amount of money</a> to a single party. Companies also may form a syndicate to manage a specific business venture if the opportunity promises an attractive <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rateofreturn.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">rate of return (RoR)</a>.\n", "\nSome projects are so large that no single company can have all of the expertise needed to do the job efficiently. This is often the case with large construction projects such as building a stadium, highway, bridge, or railroad. In these situations, companies may form a syndicate so that each firm may apply their\u00a0specific expertise to the project. For tax purposes, syndicates are generally considered as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/partnership.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">partnerships </a>or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corporation.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">corporations</a>.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nThe amount of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risk.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">risk</a> assumed by each syndicate member can vary. For instance, in an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/undividedaccount.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">undivided account</a> of an underwriting syndicate, each member is responsible for selling an allotted amount of stock along with any excess shares not sold by the syndicate as a whole.\n", "\nIn this way, an individual syndicate member may need to sell far more securities than they are allotted; other types of syndicates, however, may limit the degree of risk for each member.\n", "\nIn an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ipo.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">initial public offering (IPO)</a>, a number of investment banks and broker-dealers form a syndicate to sell new offerings of stock or\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtsecurity.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">debt securities</a>\u00a0to investors. The underwriting group shares the risk and aids in the successful distribution of the new securities issue.\n", "\nThe\u00a0lead underwriter\u00a0for the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/newissue.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">new issue</a> initiates and manages the underwriting syndicate. The syndicate is compensated by the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underwritingspread.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">underwriting spread</a>\u2014which is the difference between the price paid to the issuer and the price received from investors and other broker-dealers. An underwriting syndicate usually breaks up 30 days after the sale is complete, or if the securities cannot be sold at the offering price. There are other types of syndicates, however, that function jointly, but which are not temporary.\n", "\nSyndicates are often used in the insurance industry to spread insurance risk among\u00a0several firms. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurance-underwriter.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Insurance underwriters</a> evaluate the risk of insuring a specific person or a particular asset and use that evaluation to price an insurance policy.\n", "\nFor example, an underwriter in the corporate health insurance field may evaluate the potential health risks of a company's\u00a0employees. The underwriter\u2019s <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/actuary.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">actuary</a> would then use\u00a0statistics to assess the risk of illness for each employee in the company\u2019s workforce. If the potential risk of providing health insurance is too great for a single insurance firm, that company may form a syndicate to share the insurance risk.\n"]}
