Although the account is administered by a custodian or trustee, it's directly managed by the account holder\u2014the reason it's called \"self-directed.\"\n", "\nAvailable as either a traditional IRA (to which you make tax-deductible contributions) or a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rothira.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Roth IRA</a> (from which you take tax-free distributions), self-directed IRAs are best suited for savvy investors who already understand the alternative investments and who want to diversify in a tax-advantaged account.\n", "\nThe main difference between SDIRAs and other IRAs is the types of investments you can hold in the account. In general, regular IRAs are limited to common securities like stocks, bonds, certificates of deposit, and mutual or exchange-traded funds (ETFs). But SDIRAs allow the owner to invest in a much broader array of assets. With an SDIRA, you can hold precious metals, commodities, private placements, limited partnerships, tax lien certificates, real estate, and other sorts of alternative investments.\n", "\nAs such, an SDIRA requires greater initiative and due diligence by the account owner.\n", "\nWith most IRA providers, you can only open a regular IRA (traditional or Roth), and can only invest in the usual suspects: stocks, bonds, and mutual funds/ETFs. If you want to open a self-directed IRA, you\u2019ll need a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/approved-nonbank-trustees-and-custodians\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">qualified IRA custodian that specializes in that type of account.</a><span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nNot every SDIRA custodian offers the same range of investments. So, if you\u2019re interested in a specific asset\u2014say, gold bullion\u2014make sure it\u2019s part of a potential custodian\u2019s offerings.\n", "\nSDIRA custodians aren\u2019t allowed to give financial advice (remember, the accounts are <em>self-directed</em>)\u2014which is why traditional brokerages, banks, and investment companies usually don't offer these accounts. That means you need to do your own homework. If you need help picking or managing your investments, you should plan on working with a financial advisor.\n", "\nSelf-directed IRAs can be set up as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/traditionalira.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">traditional IRAs</a> or as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rothira.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Roth IRAs</a>. But keep in mind, the two account types have different tax treatment, eligibility requirements, contribution guidelines, and distribution rules.\n", "\nA key difference between a traditional and Roth IRA is when you pay the taxes. With traditional IRAs, you get an upfront tax break, but pay taxes on your contributions and earnings as you withdraw them during retirement. On the other hand, you don\u2019t get a tax break when you contribute to a Roth IRA. But your contributions and earnings grow tax-free, and qualified <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/distribution.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">distributions</a> are tax-free, as well.\n", "\nOf course, there are other differences to consider. Here\u2019s a quick rundown:\n", "\nThese same rules apply to whichever version of a self-directed IRA you have.\n", "\nSelf-directed Roth IRAs open up a large universe of potential investments. In addition to the standard investments\u2014stocks, bonds, cash, money market funds, and mutual funds\u2014you can hold assets that aren\u2019t typically part of a retirement portfolio.\n", "\nFor example, you can buy investment real estate to hold in your SDIRA account. You can also hold partnerships and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxlien.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tax liens</a>\u2014even a franchise business.\n", "\nHowever, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) forbids a few specified investments in self-directed IRAs, whether it\u2019s the Roth or traditional version. For example, you can\u2019t hold life insurance, S Corporation stocks, any investment that constitutes a prohibited transaction (such as one that involves \u201cself-dealing\u201d), and collectibles.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nCollectibles include a wide range of items, including antiques, artwork, alcoholic beverages, baseball cards, memorabilia, jewelry, stamps, and rare coins (note that this affects the kind of gold that a self-directed Roth IRA can hold).<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff Check with a financial advisor to be sure you aren\u2019t inadvertently violating any of the rules.\n", "\nSDIRAs have lots of benefits. But there are a few things to watch out for:\n"]}
