This plan tends to benefit small businesses that are more established and profitable.\n", "\nFor example, a startup that had just raised several rounds of funding would be in a better position to create a 412(i) plan than one that is bootstrapped and/or has an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/angelinvestor.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">angel</a> or seed funding.
