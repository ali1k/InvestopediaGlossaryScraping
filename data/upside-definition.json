Analysts commonly use either <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technicalanalysis.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">technical analysis</a> or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundamentalanalysis.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fundamental analysis </a>techniques to predict the future price of an investment, particularly stock prices. A higher upside means that the stock has more value than is currently reflected in the stock price.\n", "\nUpside refers to the predicted appreciation in the value of an investment and is the opposite of the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/downside.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">downside</a>. Arguably, the concept of upside is the motivating factor for an individual to invest. The magnitude of the upside move will depend primarily on the risk associated with that investment. The market axiom of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskreturntradeoff.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">high risk/high reward</a> holds true when it comes to deciding whether to commit to or pass on an investment.\n", "\nTypically, investors with a high tolerance for risk will choose investments with huge upside, while those that are risk-averse will opt for investments that have limited upside but will be more apt to preserve their initial investment value.\n", "\nFundamental analysis evaluates the upside price of a stock by considering the ability of the investment firm to generate sales and earnings and to make effective decisions about company assets.\u00a0Companies that manage their costs well and increase their <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profitmargin.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">profit margins</a> have a higher upside. Businesses can increase sales by moving into new markets or by adding a product line.\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/moneymanager.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Money managers</a> that use fundamental analysis also consider how effectively a business uses assets to generate sales and profits.\n", "\nTechnical analysis is a method that considers the historic patterns in the price of a stock and in the trading volume of a security. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technical-analyst.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Technical analysts</a>\u00a0believe that price movements are trends, and these managers use charts to determine the upside in a stock\u2019s price. A <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/breakout.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">breakout</a>, for example, occurs when a stock price trades above a recent price trend. If a stock has been trading between $20 and $25 per share, for example, a price move to $28 is a breakout, which is an indication that the stock price has an upside above $28.\n", "\nUpside not only refers to an investment\u2019s potential gains in value but is also a concept used to judge the success of a portfolio manager's\u00a0performance when compared to a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/benchmark.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">benchmark</a>. For many mutual funds, the investment objective\u00a0is to outperform\u00a0a specific benchmark, such as the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sp.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Standard &amp; Poor's 500 indexes</a>.\u00a0The upside capture ratio indicates how much upside the mutual fund captures when compared to the benchmark.\n", "\nUpside also plays a part\u00a0in short selling. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Short selling</a> refers to the sale of stock that an investor does not own. In short selling, the seller must deliver borrowed securities to the buyer by the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/settlementdate.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">settlement date</a>. Eventually, the short seller must buy the shares to cover the short position,\u00a0and the seller\u2019s goal is to buy back shares at a lower price. Short-sellers look for stocks that have reached their upside potential, which means\u00a0the stock's potential to decline increases.\n"]}
