One of the primary reasons to calculate DSCR is to compare it to other firms in the industry, and these comparisons are easier to run if you can simply plug in the numbers.\n", "\nLenders will routinely assess a borrower's DSCR\u00a0before making a loan. A DSCR of less than 1 means negative cash flow, which means that the borrower will be unable to cover or pay current debt obligations without drawing on outside sources\u2014 in essence, borrowing more.\n", "\nFor example, a DSCR of .95 means that there is only sufficient net operating income to cover 95% of annual debt payments. In the context of personal finance, this would mean that the borrower would have to delve into their personal funds every month to keep the project afloat. In general, lenders frown on negative cash flow, but some allow it if the borrower has strong resources in addition to their income.\n", "\nIf the debt-service coverage ratio is too close to 1, for example, 1.1, the entity is vulnerable, and a minor decline in cash flow could render it unable to service its debt.\u00a0Lenders may, in some cases, require that the borrower maintain a certain minimum\u00a0DSCR\u00a0while the loan is outstanding. Some agreements will consider a borrower who falls below that minimum to be in default. Typically, a DSCR\u00a0greater than 1 means the entity\u2014whether an individual, company, or government\u2014has sufficient income to pay its current debt obligations.\n", "\nThe minimum DSCR a lender will demand can depend on macroeconomic conditions. If the economy is growing, credit is more readily available, and lenders may be more forgiving of lower ratios. A tendency to lend to less-qualified borrowers can, in turn, affect the economy's stability, as was the case leading up to the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-crisis.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2008 financial crisis</a>. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/subprime-borrower.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Subprime borrowers</a>\u00a0were able to obtain credit, particularly mortgages, with little scrutiny.

This is expressed as a ratio and is most often computed on an annual basis.\n", "\nTo calculate the interest coverage ratio, simply divide the EBIT for the established period by the total interest payments due for that same period. The EBIT, often called net operating income or operating profit, is calculated by subtracting overhead and operating expenses, such as rent, cost of goods, freight, wages, and utilities, from revenue. This number reflects the amount of cash available after subtracting all expenses necessary to keep the business running.\n", "\nThe higher the ratio of EBIT to interest payments, the more financially stable the company. This metric only considers interest payments and not payments made on principal debt balances that may be required by lenders.\n", "\nThe debt-service coverage ratio is slightly more comprehensive. This metric assesses a company's ability to meet its minimum principal and interest payments, including\u00a0sinking fund payments, for a given period. To calculate\u00a0DSCR, EBIT is divided by the total amount of principal and interest payments required for a given period to obtain net operating income. Because it takes into account principal payments in addition to interest, the DSCR is a slightly more robust indicator of a company's financial fitness.\n", "\nIn either case, a company with a debt-service coverage ratio of less than 1.00 does not generate enough revenue to cover its minimum debt expenses. In terms of business management or investment, this represents a risky prospect since even a brief period of lower-than-average income could spell disaster.\n", "\nA limitation of the interest coverage ratio is that it does not explicitly consider the ability of the firm to repay its debts. Most long-term debt issues contain provisions for <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/amortization.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">amortization</a> with dollar sums involved comparable to the interest requirement, and failure to meet the sinking fund requirement is an act of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/default2.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">default </a>that can force the firm into bankruptcy.

For instance, if a business has net operating income of $100,000 and a total debt service of $60,000, its DSCR would be approximately 1.67. Importantly, the total debt service includes both the interest on the loan and its principal payments. From the perspective of the lender, higher DSCRs are preferable because they indicate that the borrower has ample financial resources with which to repay their loan.\n", "\nDSCRs are a commonly used metric when negotiating loan contracts between companies and banks. For instance, a business applying for a line of credit might be obligated to ensure that their DSCR does not dip below 1.25. If it does, the borrower could be found to have defaulted on the loan, giving the bank the right to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/callprovision.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">call the debt</a> or take other corrective actions. In addition to helping banks manage their risks, DSCRs can also help analysts and investors when analyzing a company\u2019s financial strength.\n", "\nWhat counts as a \u201cgood\u201d DSCR will depend on the company\u2019s industry, competitors, and stage of growth. For instance, a smaller company that is just beginning to generate cashflow might face lower DSCR expectations compared to a mature company that is already well established. As a general rule, however, a DSCR above 1.25 is often considered \u201cstrong,\u201d whereas ratios below 1.00 could indicate that the company is facing financial difficulties.\n"]}
