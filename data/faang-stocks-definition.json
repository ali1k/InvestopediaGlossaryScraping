These are just a few of the many large investors who have added FAANG stocks to their <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/portfolio.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">portfolios</a> because of their perceived strength, growth, or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/momentum.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">momentum</a>.\u00a0\n", "\nEach of the FAANG stocks trades on the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nasdaq.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nasdaq</a> exchange and is included in the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sp500.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">S&amp;P 500 Index</a>. Since the S&amp;P 500 is a broad representation of the market, the movement of the market mirrors the index's movement. Together, the FAANGs make up about 15% of\u00a0the S&amp;P 500\u2014a staggering figure considering the S&amp;P 500 is generally viewed as a proxy for the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/042915/5-industries-driving-us-economy.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">United States economy</a> as a whole.\u00a0\n", "\nThis large influence over the index means that <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volatility.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">volatility</a> in the stock price of the FAANG stocks can have a substantial effect on the performance of the S&amp;P 500 in general. In August 2018, for example, FAANG stocks were responsible for nearly 40% of the index\u2019s gain from the lows reached in February 2018.\n", "\nThe extraordinary size and influence of the FAANG stocks have prompted concerns about a potential <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bubble.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bubble</a> in FAANG stocks. These concerns started gaining prominence in 2018, when technology stocks, which had been driving consistent gains in the stock market, began losing their former strength. In November 2018, several FAANG stocks lost more than 20% of their valuations and were declared to be in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearmarket.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bear territory</a>.\u00a0\n", "\nBy some estimates, FAANG stocks lost more than a trillion dollars from their peak valuations as a result of the steep drop in the markets in November 2018. Although their valuations have since recovered, the level of volatility sometimes shown by FAANG stocks\u2014and the influence these stocks can have on the market overall\u2014is a source of concern for some investors.\n", "\nOn the other hand, those who believe in the fundamental strength of the FAANG stocks have abundant evidence for this claim. For example, Facebook is the world\u2019s largest <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/social-networking.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">social network</a> with approximately 2.7 billion users.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"6\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff In its <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/ttm.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">trailing twelve months (TTM)</a> as of June 2020, it posted revenues of $75 billion and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/netincome.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">net income</a> of $24 billion.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"8\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff <span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"7\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nAmazon, meanwhile, has become a seemingly insurmountable force in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/btoc.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">business to consumer (B2C)</a> e-commerce. With over 120 million products for sale, it has over 150 million active customers in the United States, of whom more than half pay for monthly Amazon Prime memberships. With TTM revenues of $322 billion and a net income of $13 billion, it is not hard to understand why investors believe Amazon\u2019s vast market capitalization is justified.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"10\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff <span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"9\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nOverall, it is through strong financial performance such as this that the FAANG stocks have prospered recently. Over the past five years, for instance, Facebook and Amazon have seen stock-price increases of 185% and 500%, respectively. For their part, Apple and Alphabet saw price increases of about 175% over that same timeframe, whereas Netflix saw its value rise by nearly 450%.\n", "\nThe five stocks that make up the \u201cFAANG\u201d acronym\u2014Facebook (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=FB\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FB</a>), Amazon (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=AMZN\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AMZN</a>), Apple (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=AAPL4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AAPL</a>), Netflix (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=NFLX\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NFLX</a>), and Alphabet (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"5\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=GOOG\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GOOG</a>)\u2014are all well-known brands among consumers. But they are also famous for their remarkable growth in recent years, with market capitalizations ranging from $238 billion (in the case of Netflix) to $2.26 trillion (in the case of Apple), as of January 2021. From an investment perspective, these five stocks are generally praised for their stellar historical track records and clear leadership positions within their industries.\n", "\nInvestors disagree about whether the FAANG stocks are overvalued. Their proponents will argue that their valuations are justified based on their fundamental strength as businesses. But critics argue that, even with impressive business performance, the FAANG stocks\u2019 prices have become so expensive that it may be difficult to realize attractive long-term profits from investing in them. Ultimately, this \u201cdebate\u201d between investors is best captured by the buying and selling patterns in the FAANG stocks themselves.\n", "\nThe FAANG stocks are all easy to acquire, in the sense that they are publicly traded companies with substantial daily trading volumes. They are also routinely included in popular <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">exchange-traded funds (ETFs)</a>. However, investors who believe that the FAANG stocks may be overvalued would argue that they are difficult to acquire at an economical price. These investors may be tempted to delay purchasing FAANG stocks, waiting for their valuations to decline.\n"]}
