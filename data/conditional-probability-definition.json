Conditional probability is calculated by multiplying the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/compound-probability.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">probability</a> of the preceding event by the updated probability of the succeeding, or conditional, event.\n", "\nFor example:\n", "\nA conditional probability would look at these two events in relationship with one another, such as\u00a0the probability that you are both accepted to college,\u00a0<em>and\u00a0</em>you are provided with dormitory housing.\n", "\nConditional probability can be contrasted with <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unconditional_probability.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">unconditional probability</a>. Unconditional probability refers to the likelihood that an event will take place irrespective of whether any other events have taken place or any other conditions are present.\n", "\nAs previously stated, conditional probabilities are contingent on a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/prior_probability.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">previous result</a>. It also makes a number of assumptions. For example, suppose you are drawing three marbles\u2014red, blue, and green\u2014from a bag. Each marble has an equal chance of being drawn. What is the conditional probability of drawing the red marble after already drawing the blue one?\n", "\nFirst, the probability of drawing a blue marble is about 33% because it is one possible outcome out of three. Assuming this first event occurs, there will be two marbles remaining, with each having a 50% chance of being drawn. So the chance of drawing a blue marble after already drawing a red marble would be about 16.5% (33% x 50%).\n", "\nAs another example to provide further insight into this concept, consider that a fair die has been rolled and you are asked to give the probability that it was a five. There are six equally likely outcomes, so your answer is 1/6. But imagine if before you answer, you get extra information that the number rolled was odd. Since there are only three odd numbers that are possible, one of which is five, you would certainly revise your estimate for the likelihood that a five was rolled from 1/6 to 1/3.\n", "\nThis\u00a0<em>revised</em>\u00a0probability that an event\u00a0<em>A</em>\u00a0has occurred, considering the additional information that another event\u00a0<em>B</em>\u00a0has definitely occurred on this trial of the experiment, is called the\u00a0<em>conditional probability of</em>\u00a0<em>A</em>\u00a0<em>given</em>\u00a0<em>B</em>\u00a0and is denoted by\u00a0P(A|B).\n", "\n<em>Or:</em>\n", "\nAs another example, suppose a student is applying for admission to a university and hopes to receive an academic\u00a0scholarship. The school to which they are applying accepts 100 of every 1,000 applicants (10%) and awards academic scholarships to 10 of every 500 students who are accepted (2%). Of the scholarship recipients, 50% of them also receive university stipends for books, meals, and housing. For our ambitious student, the chance of them being accepted then receiving a scholarship is .2% (.1 x .02). The chance of them being accepted, receiving the scholarship, then also receiving a stipend for books, etc. is .1% (.1 x .02 x .5).
