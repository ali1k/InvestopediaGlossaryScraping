If nontaxable, a reverse triangular merger is considered a reorganization for tax purposes.\n", "\nIn a reverse triangular merger, the acquirer creates a subsidiary that merges into the selling entity and then liquidates, leaving the selling entity as the surviving entity and a subsidiary of the acquirer. The buyer\u2019s stock is then issued to the seller\u2019s shareholders.\n", "\nBecause the reverse triangular merger retains the seller entity and its business contracts, the reverse triangular merger is used more often than the triangular merger.\n", "\nIn a reverse triangular <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/06/themerger.asp\">merger</a>, at least 50% of the payment is the stock of the acquirer, and the acquirer gains all assets and liabilities of the seller.

In addition, the acquirer must be approved by the boards of directors of both entities.\n"]}
