The exemption, found in section 3 of the act, reads in part:\u00a0\n", "\nTo qualify for the 3C7 exemption, the private fund must show that they have no plans of making an initial public offering (IPO) and that their investors are qualified purchasers.

A private fund is not required to go through Securities and Exchange Commission registration or provide ongoing disclosure. 3C7 funds are also exempt from issuing a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/prospectus.asp\">prospectus</a> that would outline\u00a0investment positions publicly. 3C7 funds are also referred to as 3C7 companies or 3(c)(7) funds.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"7\"></span><span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\"></span>\u00a0\n", "\n3C7 is one of two exemptions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 that <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedgefund.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hedge funds</a>, venture capital funds, and other private equity funds use to avoid SEC restrictions.
