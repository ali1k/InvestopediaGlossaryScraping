In Latin, \u201cex gratia\u201d means \u201cby favor.\u201d\n", "\nEx gratia payments differ from legally-mandated payments because ex gratia payments are voluntary. Usually, organizations, governments,\u00a0and insurers will only provide compensation to victims if they are legally required to do so. Because of this, ex gratia payments are not very common.\n", "\nIn the case of an insurance company, if a policyholder suffers an injury that is <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurance-coverage.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">covered</a> by the terms of their insurance policy, the insurer is legally obligated to pay for the claim. This type of payment is not voluntary. It\u00a0is the result of a legal obligation, and it typically carries with it an admission of liability.\n", "\nIn contrast, an ex gratia payment is a gesture of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/goodwill.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">goodwill</a>. The type of payment is made following a specific loss or damage to a property; an ex gratia payment does not carry with it any admission of liability. A company providing a one-time credit to its customers would not be considered to be making an ex gratia payment because the payment is not related to a specific loss. However, a company that provides a credit after a service disruption would be considered to be making an ex gratia payment.\n", "\nAn organization may use ex gratia payments as part of a longer-term strategy to maintain good relations with the individual receiving the payment. For example, a large retailer that is forced to reduce staff may provide a severance payment that is larger than the legal requirement. The retailer may determine that this gesture of goodwill will reduce the negative publicity generated by the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/layoff.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">layoffs</a>. Similarly, British Airways often gives an ex gratia payment card to past customers who may have been inconvenienced to maintain good customer relations.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nEx gratia\u00a0payments in the U.S. are typically subject to federal and state income taxes. However, in the\u00a0United Kingdom,\u00a0ex\u00a0gratia payments under \u00a330,000\u00a0are not taxable as long as the payment is not\u00a0for\u00a0work undertaken or services rendered.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nWhile the first \u00a330,000 of an\u00a0ex gratia payment\u00a0made to you will be\u00a0tax-free, taxpayers in the United Kingdom must inform Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) of the\u00a0payment\u00a0at the end of the tax year in order to guarantee that they do not have to pay any income tax or national insurance on it.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n"]}
