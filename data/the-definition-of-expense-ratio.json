Because an expense ratio reduces a fund's assets it reduces the returns investors receive.\n", "\nAn example of an expense ratio would be the 0.21% that the T. Rowe Price Equity Index 500 Fund charges. It means that 0.21% of its assets are used towards paying administrative and operating costs, reducing an investor's returns by that amount.\n", "\nAn expense ratio is important because it lets an investor know how much they are paying in costs by investing in a specific fund and how much their returns will be reduced by. The lower the expense ratio the better because it means that an investor is receiving higher returns on their invested capital.\n", "\nThe expense ratio is calculated by dividing total fund costs by total fund assets.\n", "\nMutual funds that invest in large companies should not have an expense ratio above 1% while funds that invest in smaller companies should not have an expense ratio above 1.25%. There are funds with expense ratios higher than this, and they can either be viewed as expensive funds or funds that provide a special service justifying their high cost.\n"]}
