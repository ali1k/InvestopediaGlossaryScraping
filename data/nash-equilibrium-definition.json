More specifically, the Nash equilibrium is a concept of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gametheory.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">game theory</a> where the optimal outcome of a game is one where no player has an incentive to deviate from their chosen strategy after considering an opponent's choice.\n", "\nOverall, an individual can receive no incremental benefit from changing actions, assuming other players remain constant in their strategies. A game may have multiple Nash equilibria or none at all.\n", "\nNash equilibrium is named after its inventor, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/john-f-nash-jr.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">John Nash</a>, an American mathematician. It is considered one of the most important concepts of game theory, which attempts to determine mathematically and logically the actions that participants of a game should take to secure the best outcomes for themselves.\n", "\nThe reason why Nash equilibrium is considered such an important concept of game theory relates to its applicability. The Nash equilibrium can be incorporated into a wide range of disciplines, from <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/economics-4689800\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">economics</a> to the social sciences.\n", "\nTo quickly find the Nash equilibrium or see if it even exists, reveal each player's strategy to the other players. If no one changes their strategy, then the Nash equilibrium is proven.\n", "\nNash equilibrium is often compared alongside dominant strategy, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/071515/what-difference-between-dominant-strategy-solution-and-nash-equilibrium-solution.asp\">both being strategies of game theory</a>. The Nash equilibrium states that the optimal strategy for an actor is to stay the course of their initial strategy while knowing the opponent's strategy and that all players maintain the same strategy, as long as all other players do not change their strategy.\n", "\nDominant strategy asserts that the chosen strategy of an actor will lead to better results out of all the possible strategies that can be used, regardless of the strategy that the opponent uses.\n", "\nBoth the terms are similar but slightly different. Nash equilibrium states that nothing is gained if any of the players change their strategy if all other players maintain their strategy. Dominant strategy asserts that a player will choose a strategy that will lead to the best outcome regardless of the strategies that other plays have chosen. Dominant strategy can be included in Nash equilibrium whereas a Nash equilibrium may not be the best strategy in a game.\n", "\nImagine a game between Tom and Sam. In this simple game, both players can choose strategy A, to receive $1, or strategy B, to lose $1. Logically, both players choose strategy A and receive a payoff of $1.\n", "\nIf you revealed Sam's strategy to Tom and vice versa, you see that no player deviates from the original choice. Knowing the other player's move means little and doesn't change either player's behavior. Outcome A represents a Nash equilibrium.\n", "\nThe <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/prisoners-dilemma.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">prisoner's dilemma</a> is a common situation analyzed in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-theory/09/game-theory-beyond-basics.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">game theory</a> that can employ the Nash equilibrium. In this game, two criminals are arrested and each is held in solitary confinement with no means of communicating with the other. The prosecutors do not have the evidence to convict the pair, so they offer each prisoner the opportunity to either betray the other by testifying that the other committed the crime or cooperate by remaining silent.\n", "\nIf both prisoners betray each other, each serves five years in prison. If A betrays B but B remains silent, prisoner A is set free and prisoner B serves 10 years in prison or vice versa. If each remains silent, then each serves just one year in prison.\n", "\nThe Nash equilibrium in this example is for both players to betray each other. Even though mutual cooperation leads to a better outcome if one prisoner chooses mutual cooperation and the other does not, one prisoner's outcome is worse.\n", "\nNash equilibrium in game theory is a situation in which a player will continue with their chosen strategy, having no incentive to deviate from it, after taking into consideration the opponent's strategy.\n", "\nTo find the Nash equilibrium in a game, one would have to model out each of the possible scenarios to determine the results and then choose what the optimal strategy would be. In a two-person game, this would take into consideration the possible strategies that both players could choose. If neither player changes their strategy knowing all of the information, a Nash equilibrium has occurred.\n", "\nNash equilibrium is important because it helps a player <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/111113/advanced-game-theory-strategies-decisionmaking.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">determine</a> the best payoff in a situation based not only on their decisions but also on the decisions of other parties involved. Nash equilibrium can be utilized in many facets of life, from business strategies to selling a house to war, and social sciences.\n", "\nThere is not a specific formula to calculate the Nash equilibrium, but rather it can be determined by modeling out different scenarios within a given game to determine the payoff of each strategy and which would be the optimal strategy to choose.\n", "\nThe primary limitation of the Nash equilibrium is that it requires an individual to know their opponent's strategy. A Nash equilibrium can only occur if a player chooses to remain with their current strategy if they know their opponent's strategy.\n", "\nIn most cases, such as in war, whether that be a military war or a bidding war, an individual rarely knows the opponent's strategy or what they want the outcome to be. Unlike dominant strategy, the Nash equilibrium doesn't always lead to the most optimal outcome, it just means that an individual chooses the best strategy based on the information they have.\n", "\nFurthermore, in multiple games played with the same opponents, the Nash equilibrium does not take into consideration past behavior, which often predicts future behavior.\n", "\nThe Nash equilibrium is a component of game theory that asserts that a player will continue with their chosen strategy while knowing their opponent's strategy as they have no incentive to change course. The Nash equilibrium can be applied in a variety of real-life situations in determining what the best payoff in a scenario will be based on your decisions as well as your opponent's decisions.\n"]}
