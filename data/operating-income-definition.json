A business's operating expenses are costs incurred from normal\u00a0operating activities and include items such as office supplies and utilities.\n", "\nOperating income is a measurement that shows how much of a company's revenue will eventually become profits.

A company that's generating an increasing amount of operating income is seen as favorable because it means that the company's management is generating more revenue while controlling expenses, production costs, and overhead.\n", "\nThe operating income formula is outlined below:\n", "\n<strong><span data-value=\"\\text{Operating Income} = \\text{Gross Income} - \\text{Operating Expenses}\">\ufeff<span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\">\n<math>\n<semantics>\n<mrow>\n<mtext>\nOperating\u00a0Income\n</mtext>\n<mo>\n=\n</mo>\n<mtext>\nGross\u00a0Income\n</mtext>\n<mo>\n\u2212\n</mo>\n<mtext>\nOperating\u00a0Expenses\n</mtext>\n</mrow>\n<annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\n\\text{Operating Income} = \\text{Gross Income} - \\text{Operating Expenses}\n</annotation>\n</semantics>\n</math></span><span class=\"katex-html\"><span class=\"strut\"></span><span class=\"strut bottom\"></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"mord text\"><span class=\"mord mathrm\">Operating\u00a0Income</span></span><span class=\"mrel\">=</span><span class=\"mord text\"><span class=\"mord mathrm\">Gross\u00a0Income</span></span><span class=\"mbin\">\u2212</span><span class=\"mord text\"><span class=\"mord mathrm\">Operating\u00a0Expenses</span></span></span></span></span></span>\ufeff </strong>\n", "\nOperating expenses include\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sga.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">selling, general, and administrative expense (SG&amp;A)</a>, depreciation,\u00a0and amortization, and other operating expenses. Operating\u00a0income excludes items such as investments in other firms\u00a0(non-operating income), taxes,\u00a0and interest expenses. In addition, nonrecurring items, such as cash paid for a lawsuit settlement, are not included. Operating income is required to calculate the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operatingmargin.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">operating margin</a>, which describes a company's operating efficiency.\n", "\nMany companies focus on operating income when measuring the operational success of the business. For example, Company ABC, a hospital and drug firm, reports an operating income rise by 20% year-over-year to $25 million during the\u00a0first two quarters of its fiscal year. The company realized an increase in revenue and operating income\u00a0due to an increase in patient volume over the two quarters. The rise in patient visits was driven by two of the company's new immunotherapy drugs: One drug treats lung cancer and the other drug treats melanoma.\n", "\nIn another example, we have Company Red, which reports financial results for the first quarter of its fiscal year. The company saw operating income rise by 37%, when compared with the same period in the previous year. The report of the increase in operating income is especially important because the company is looking to merge with Company Blue, and shareholders are slated to vote on the potential merger next month. While Company Red's\u00a0first-quarter sales did fall by 3%, its operating income growth could potentially give Company Blue shareholders confidence in voting to merge the two companies.\n", "\nThe example below highlights how to find and calculate operating income using the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incomestatement.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">income statement</a> for Apple (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=aapl\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AAPL</a>).

Operating income includes more expense line items than gross profit, which primarily includes the costs of production. Operating income includes both COGS\u2014or cost of sales\u2014as well as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/noninterest-expense.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">operating expenses</a>. However, operating income does not include items such as other income, non-operating income,\u00a0and non-operating expenses. Instead,\u00a0those figures are included in the net income calculation.\n", "\nNot exactly -- operating income is what is left over after a company subtracts the cost of good sold (COGS) and other operating expenses from the sales revenues it receives. However, it does not take into consideration taxes, interest or financing charges, or depreciation and amortization.\n", "\nWhile a good operating income is often indicative of profitability, there may be cases when a company earns money from operations, but must spend more on interest and taxes. This could be due to a one-time charge, poor financial decisions made by the company, or an increasing interest rate environment that impacts outstanding debts. Alternatively, a company may earn a great deal of interest income, which would not show up as operating income.\n", "\nIn contrast to operating income, non-operating income is the portion of an organization's\u00a0income\u00a0that is derived from activities not related to its core business operations. It can include items such as\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">dividend</a><strong>\u00a0</strong>income, interest, gains or losses from investments, as well as those incurred in foreign exchange and asset write-downs.\n", "\nOperating income is recorded on the\u00a0income statement, and can be found toward the bottom of the statement as its own line item. It should appear next to non-operating income, helping investors to distinguish between the two and recognize which income came from what sources.\n"]}
