Fiscal policy stimulus, including reductions in taxes and increased government spending, are typically designed to boost the real economy, although financial markets also\u00a0benefit from\u00a0strengthening economic growth.\n", "\nThe term Keynesian Put was coined by analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in 2016. It is both a reference to the economic theory of 20<sup>th</sup> century British economist <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/john_maynard_keynes.asp\">John Maynard Keynes</a>\u00a0who was a proponent of government spending when demand was slack, and a play on the term <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/greenspanput.asp\">Greenspan Put</a>, which was first used in 1998 to describe the extremely accommodative monetary policies of the then Federal Reserve Chairman, Alan Greenspan\u00a0to avoid recession.\n", "\nKeynesian Put represents a\u00a0promise that the government and fiscal authorities will spend\u00a0to maintain\u00a0growth and inflation in the global economy. While accommodative <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monetarypolicy.asp\">monetary policy</a> in the form of lower interest rates is meant to act as a stimulus to the real economy, since the 2007 to 2008 global financial crisis, global central banks have adopted extreme accommodative policies that have helped push up the price of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risk-asset.asp\">risk assets</a> but with limited results for the real economy.\n", "\nIn this context, renewed support for Keynesian-style fiscal stimulus measures has\u00a0led to expectations that governments around the world will use their spending power to boost the economy\u00a0and, in turn, help support asset prices.\n", "\nAs of 2016, there had been no specific measures to stimulate demand by any nation although the U.S. investment bank was recommending that investors be prepared and consider rebalancing portfolios to favor companies that might benefit from economic stimulation. These include retail, for example, defense, infrastructure\u00a0and real assets.\n", "\nIn addition to the suggestion of increased fiscal spending by U.S. presidents,\u00a0the Bank of England\u00a0has followed\u00a0suit since Brexit, Germany is its\u00a0austerity measured\u00a0in the European Union\u00a0and Japan is also considering stimulus.\n", "\nAlthough the effect of Keynesian Put is largely speculation, in the short term, infrastructure spending to improve\u00a0roads, bridges, airports, hospitals, high-speed internet\u00a0and to boost defense\u00a0can improve an economy because initiatives raise corporate profits, create jobs\u00a0and increase the GDP. However, increased government spending will raise the deficit even higher increasing taxes and inflation.\u00a0The main drawback to Keynesian Put is that increased\u00a0spending and the resulting rise in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp\">inflation</a> is detrimental to\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bondholder.asp\">bondholders</a>.\n"]}
