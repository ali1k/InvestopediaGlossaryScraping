Similarly, it can refer to the recovery of an individual whose personal financial situation improves after some time.\n", "\nTurnarounds are important because they mark an upward shift or improvement for an entity after it experiences a significant period of negativity. The turnaround is akin to a restructuring process where the entity converts the period of loss into one of profitability and success while stabilizing its future. In investing, the term can mean the amount of elapsed time between the placing and fulfilling of an order.\n", "\nTurnarounds may happen on many levels from the individual to a country's economy or even be a global event. The term indicates a phase when an entity begins to experience steady and positive financial or performance recovery after a time of decline.\n", "\nIn most cases, the first step in moving into a turnaround phase is to acknowledge the problems creating a downturn. In the case of a business, they may examine changes in management or problem identification and solving strategies. In dire situations, the best action may be to liquidate the company.\n", "\nThere are specific features that will usually identify an entity in need of a turnaround.\u00a0For a business, these may include declines in the price of its stock, the need to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/layoff.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">layoff</a> employees, and revenues that do not cover requirements to pay <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditor.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">creditors</a>.\n", "\nChanges in a firm's competitive advantage and outdated products or service may also be indicative of a business that needs to investigate turnaround strategies.
