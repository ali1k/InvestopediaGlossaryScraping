Typically positions are held from periods of milliseconds to hours and are generally closed out before the end of the day, so that no risk is held after hours or overnight.\n", "\nThere is no special qualification required to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/051415/10-steps-becoming-day-trader.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">become a day trader</a>.

Successful day trading requires extensive knowledge and experience. Day traders employ a variety of methods to make trading decisions. Some traders employ computer trading models that use technical analysis to calculate favorable probabilities, while some trade on their instinct.\n", "\nA day trader is primarily concerned with the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-action.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">price action</a> characteristics of a stock. This is unlike investors, who use <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundamentalanalysis.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fundamental</a> data to analyze the long-term growth potential of a company to decide whether to buy, sell or hold its stock.\n", "\nPrice volatility and average day <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/range.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">range</a> are critical to a day trader. A security must have sufficient price movement for a day trader to achieve a profit. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volume.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Volume</a> and liquidity are also crucial because entering and exiting trades quickly is vital to capturing small profits per trade. Securities with a small daily range or light daily volume would not be of interest to a day trader.\n", "\nA <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/patterndaytrader.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pattern day trader</a> (PDT) is a regulatory designation for those traders or investors that execute four or more\u00a0day trades\u00a0over the span of five business days using a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marginaccount.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">margin account</a>.\n", "\nThe number of day trades must constitute more than 6% of the margin account's total trade activity during that five-day window. If this occurs, the trader's account will be flagged as a PDT by their <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/broker.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">broker</a>. The PDT designation places certain restrictions on further trading; this designation is put in place to discourage investors from trading excessively.\n", "\nDay traders are attuned to events that cause short-term market moves. Trading the news is a popular technique. Scheduled announcements such as economic statistics, corporate earnings, or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">interest rates</a> are subject to market expectations and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketpsychology.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">market psychology</a>. Markets react when those expectations are not met or are exceeded, usually with sudden, significant moves, which can benefit day traders.\n", "\nAnother trading method is known as fading the gap at the open. When the opening price shows a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gap.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">gap</a> from the previous day\u2019s close, taking a position in the opposite direction of the gap is known as fading the gap. For days when there is no news or there are no gaps, early in the morning, day traders will take a view on the general direction of the market.\n", "\nIf they expect the market to move up, they would buy securities that exhibit strength when their prices dip. If the market is trending down, they would <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/short.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">short</a> securities that exhibit weakness when their prices bounce.\n", "\nMost independent day traders have short days, working two to five hours per day. Often they will practice making simulated trades for several months before beginning to make live trades. They track their successes and failures versus the market, aiming to learn by experience.\n", "\nDay traders use several intraday strategies. These may include:\n", "\nThe most significant benefit of day trading is that positions are not affected by the possibility of negative overnight news that has the potential to impact the price of securities materially. Such news includes vital economic and earnings reports, as well as broker upgrades and downgrades that occur either before the market opens or after the market closes.\n", "\nTrading on an intraday basis offers several other key advantages. One advantage is the ability to use tight <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/06/stoplossorderdetails.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">stop-loss orders</a>\u2014the act of raising a stop price to minimize losses from a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">long position</a>. Another includes the increased access to margin\u2014and hence, greater leverage. Day trading also provides traders with more learning opportunities.\u00a0\n", "\nHowever, with every silver lining, there are also storm clouds. While <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/053115/average-rate-return-day-traders.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">day trading can be highly profitable</a>, it still comes with plenty of risks.\n", "\nDisadvantages of day trading include insufficient time for a position to see increases in profit, in some cases any profit at all, and increased commission costs due to trading more frequently, which eats away at the profit margins a trader can expect. Day traders that engage in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/100913/basics-short-selling.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">short selling</a> or use margin to leverage long positions can see losses amplify quickly, leading to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margincall.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">margin calls</a>.\n"]}
