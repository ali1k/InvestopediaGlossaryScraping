Currently, there are seven federal tax brackets, each assigned a different rate, ranging from 10% to 37%, with the dollar ranges in each varying\u00a0for <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/single.asp\">single filers</a>, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mfj.asp\">married joint filers</a> (and qualifying widow(er)s), <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mfs.asp\">married filing separate</a> filers, and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/head_of_household.asp\">head of household</a> filers, resulting in 28 effective tax brackets.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\"></span>\n", "\nWhen determining which tax bracket to use, a taxpayer should first calculate their <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxableincome.asp\">taxable income</a> (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earnedincome.asp\">earned</a> and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investmentincome.asp\">investment income</a> minus adjustments and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tax-deduction.asp\">deductions</a>).\n", "\nLet\u2019s take an example based on the rates for the tax year 2020.

Single filers who earn more than this amount will have their first $9,875 in earnings taxed at 10%, but their earnings past that cutoff point and up to $40,125 are subjected to a 12% rate, the next bracket.

A tax rate is a percentage at which income is taxed; each tax bracket has a different tax rate (10%, 12%, 22%, etc.),\u00a0referred to as the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marginaltaxrate.asp\">marginal rate</a>. However, most taxpayers\u2014all except those who fall squarely into the minimum bracket\u2014have income that is taxed progressively, so they\u2019re actually subject to several different rates, beyond the nominal one of their tax bracket. Your tax bracket does not necessarily reflect how much you will pay in total taxes. The term for this is the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/effectivetaxrate.asp\">effective tax rate</a>.

They stress that it is only fair that wealthy taxpayers pay more in taxes than the poor and middle class, offsetting the inequality of income distribution. That makes the\u00a0progressive taxation system \u201cprogressive\u201d in both senses of the word: It rises in stages and is designed with help for lower-income taxpayers in mind. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/062615/10-little-known-ways-reduce-your-401k-taxes.asp\">Taxes you pay on 401(k) withdrawals</a>, for instance, are also based on tax brackets.\n", "\nSupporters maintain that this system can generate higher revenues for governments and still be fair by letting taxpayers lower their tax bill through adjustments, such as tax deductions and/or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxcredit.asp\">tax credits</a> for outlays such as charitable contributions. The higher income that taxpayers realize can then be funneled back into the economy. Furthermore, the use of tax brackets has an automatic stabilizing effect on an individual's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aftertaxincome.asp\">after-tax income</a>, as a decrease in funds is counteracted by a decrease in the tax rate, leaving the individual with a less substantial decrease.\n", "\nOpponents of tax brackets and progressive <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxschedule.asp\">tax schedules </a>argue that everyone, regardless of income or economic status, is equal under the law and there should be no discrimination between rich and poor. They also point out that progressive taxation can lead to a substantial discrepancy between the amount of tax wealthy people pay and the amount of government representation they receive. Some even go on to point out that citizens get only one vote per person regardless of the personal or even national percentage of tax that they pay.\n", "\nOpponents also claim that higher taxation at higher income levels can (and does) lead to the wealthy spending money to exploit tax law loopholes and find creative ways to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxshelter.asp\">shelter</a> earnings and assets\u2014often with the result that they actually end up paying less in taxes than the less well-off, depriving the government of revenue. (American companies that relocate their headquarters abroad, for example, frequently do so to avoid U.S. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corporatetax.asp\">corporate taxes</a>.)\n", "\nThey also assert that the progressive system has historically led to reduced personal savings rates among taxpayers.
