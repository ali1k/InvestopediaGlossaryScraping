The types and amount of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/welfare.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">welfare</a> available to individuals and families vary depending on the country, state, or region. In the U.S., the federal government provides <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/grant.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">grants</a> to each state through the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nSocial welfare systems provide assistance to individuals and families through programs such as health care, food stamps, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unemployment-compensation.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">unemployment compensation</a>, housing assistance, and child care assistance. In the U.S., a caseworker is assigned to each individual or family applying for benefits to determine and confirm the applicant's needs.\n", "\nThe benefits available to an individual vary by state. Eligibility is determined based on factors surrounding the person\u2019s financial status and how it relates to the minimum acceptable levels within a particular state. The factors involved can include the size of the family unit, current income levels, or an assessed disability.\n", "\nWithin each state, social welfare systems may go by different names, but they often serve similar functions. This can cause confusion when attempting to compare one state's program to another. Additionally, the requirements to qualify also vary, depending on the poverty line in a particular state. This allows for adjustments based on items such as cost of living that are not standardized across the country.\n", "\nAvailable benefits generally cover assistance for food, housing, child care, and medical care. In the case of TANF, federal funds are provided to the states for distribution. These funds may be used for cash assistance, allowing a household to spend the funds as it deems necessary to meet its needs and obligations.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nSome available housing benefits go beyond locating suitable and affordable properties and providing housing cost assistance. A household may qualify for assistance to complete certain energy efficiency upgrades.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff It may also receive funds to help pay utility bills.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nBenefits around health and nutrition can include access to affordable medical care. Food and nutrition programs may supply funds, often referred to as food stamps or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), to provide easier access to food in general.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff Additional nutritional assistance through the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program provides food-specific benefits to ensure pregnant women and young children have access to healthy food options to promote growth and development.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"5\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nOther programs that are parts of the social welfare system include disaster relief assistance, educational assistance, agricultural loans, and services specifically for veterans.\n"]}
