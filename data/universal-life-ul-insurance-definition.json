Most UL insurance policies contain a flexible-premium option. However, some require a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/05/singlepremlife.asp\">single premium</a> (single lump-sum premium) or fixed premiums (scheduled fixed premiums).\n", "\nA UL insurance option <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/07/whole_universal.asp\">provides more flexibility than whole life insurance</a>. Policyholders can adjust their premiums and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deathbenefit.asp\">death benefits</a>. UL insurance premiums consist of two components:\u00a0a cost of insurance (COI) amount and a saving component, known as the cash value.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nAs the name implies, the COI is the minimum amount of a premium payment required to keep the policy active. It consists of several items\u00a0rolled together into one payment. COI includes the charges for mortality, policy administration, and other directly associated expenses\u00a0to keeping the policy in force. COI will vary by policy based on the policyholder\u2019s age, insurability, and the insured risk amount.\u00a0\n", "\nCollected premiums in excess of the cost of UL insurance accumulate within the cash value portion of the policy. Over time the cost of insurance\u00a0will increase as the insured ages. However, if sufficient, the accumulated cash value will cover the increases in the COI.\n", "\nMuch like a savings account, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/020916/universal-life-how-much-cash-value-retirement.asp\">a UL insurance policy can accumulate cash value</a>. In a UL insurance policy, the cash value earns interest\u00a0based\u00a0on the current market or minimum interest rate, whichever is greater.\u00a0As cash value accumulates, policyholders may access a portion of the cash value without affecting the guaranteed death benefit.\n", "\nHowever, policyholders who do will pay taxes on the withdrawals they make from the excess cash value of the UL insurance plan. Also, depending on when the policy and premium payments are made, earnings will be available as either <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lifo.asp\">last in, first out\u00a0(LIFO)</a> or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fifo.asp\">first in, first out\u00a0(FIFO)</a> funds.\u00a0Upon the death of the insured, the insurance company will retain any remaining cash value, with\u00a0beneficiaries\u00a0only receiving the policy\u2019s death benefit.\n", "\nUniversal life policyholders may borrow against the accumulated cash value without tax implications.\u00a0However, if they do, interest will be calculated on the loan amount, and there will be a cash surrender fee. Unpaid loans will reduce the death benefit by the outstanding amount, with unpaid interest on the loan deducted from the remaining cash value.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nUnlike whole life insurance policies, which have fixed premiums over the life of the policy, a UL insurance policy can have flexible premiums. Policyholders can remit premiums that are more than the COI.\u00a0The excess premium is added to the cash value and accumulates interest.\u00a0If there is enough cash value, policyholders may skip payments without the threat of a policy lapse.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nThat said, policyholders must\u00a0be attentive to the rising cost of insurance as they age and plan accordingly.\u00a0Depending on the credited interest, there may not be enough cash value to keep the policy in force, thus requiring them to pay higher premiums. Missed payments must be paid within a specific time frame for the policy to remain in force.\n"]}
