Equity-linked notes are usually structured to return the initial investment with a variable interest portion that depends on the performance of the linked equity. ELNs can be structured in many different ways, but the vanilla version works like a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stripbond.asp\">strip bond</a> combined with a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp\">call option</a> on a specific security, a basket of securities or an index like the S&amp;P 500 or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/djia.asp\">DJIA</a>. In the case of a note linked to an equity index, the security would typically be called an equity index-linked note.\n", "\nEquity-linked notes provide\u00a0a way for investors to protect their capital while also getting the potential for an above-average return compared to regular bonds. In theory, the upside potential for returns in an equity-linked note is unlimited, whereas the downside risk is capped. Even in the worst-case scenario, most equity-linked notes offer full principal protection. That is what makes this type of a structured product appealing to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskaverse.asp\">risk-averse</a> investors who nevertheless have a bullish outlook on the market. That said, equity-linked notes only pay on maturity, so there is an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/opportunitycost.asp\">opportunity cost</a> for locking in that money if only the principal is returned in the end.\n", "\nIn the simplest form, a $1,000 5-year equity-linked note could be structured to use $800 of the fund to buy a 5-year strip bond with a 4.5% yield-to-maturity and then invest and reinvest the other $200 in call options for the S&amp;P 500 over the 5-year life of the note. There is a chance that the options will expire worthless, in which case the investor gets back the $1,000 initially put in. If, however, the options appreciate in value with the S&amp;P 500, those returns are added to the $1,000 that will eventually be returned to the investor.\n", "\nIn practice, an equity-linked note will have a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/participationrate.asp\">participation rate</a>, which is the percentage amount that the investor in the note participates in the appreciation of the underlying equity. If the participation rate is 100%, then a 5% increase in the underlying is a 5% increase for the eventual payout on the note. However, the cost of structuring the ELN and managing it can lower the participation rate. In the case of a 75% participation rate, for example, a 5% appreciation in the underlying is only worth 3.75% to the investor.\u00a0\n", "\nEquity-linked notes can also use different structures and features. Some will use an averaging formula to smooth out returns on the equity-linked portion or a periodic cap that limits the ELN\u2019s upside by realizing returns at a particular level on a regular basis. There are also types of equity-linked notes that use dynamic hedging instead of options, deploying leverage to increase returns from the underlying equity. Overall, equity-linked notes can be a powerful tool for investors who want to protect their principle while still having the potential upside of an equity investment.\n"]}
