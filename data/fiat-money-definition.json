The value of fiat money is derived from the relationship between supply and demand and the stability of the issuing government, rather than the worth of a commodity backing it as is the case for commodity money.

The word \"fiat\" comes from the Latin and is often translated as the decree \"it shall be\" or \"let it be done.\"<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nBecause fiat money is not linked to physical reserves, such as a national stockpile of gold or silver, it risks losing value due to inflation or even becoming worthless in the event of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hyperinflation.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hyperinflation</a>.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff If people lose faith in a nation's currency, the money will no longer hold value.

In this sense, U.S. dollars are now \"legal tender,\" rather than \"lawful money,\" which can be exchanged for gold, silver, or any other commodity.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"7\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nFiat money serves as a good currency if it can handle the roles that a nation's economy needs of its monetary unit\u2014storing value, providing a numerical account, and facilitating exchange.

In response to serious economic problems, the country's central bank began to print money at a staggering pace. That resulted in hyperinflation, which ran between\u00a0230 and 500 billion percent in 2008.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"11\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff Prices rose rapidly and consumers were forced to carry bags of money just to purchase basic staples.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"12\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff\u00a0At the height of the crisis, a 100-trillion Zimbabwean dollar was worth\u00a0about 40 cents in U.S. currency.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"13\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff\n", "\nIn contrast to commodity-based money like gold coins or paper bills redeemable for precious metals, fiat money is backed entirely by the full faith and trust in the government that issued it. One reason this has merit is because governments demand that you pay taxes in the fiat money it issues. Since everybody needs to pay taxes, or else face stiff penalties or prison, people will accept it in exchange (this is known as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/chartalism.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chartalism</a>). Other theories of money, such as the credit theory, suggest that since all money is a credit-debt relation, it does not matter if money is backed by anything to maintain value.\n", "\nPrior to the 20th century, most countries utilized some sort of gold standard or backing by a commodity. As international trade and finance grew in scale and scope, however, the limited amount of gold coming out of mines and in central bank vaults could not keep up with the new value that was being created, causing serious disruptions to global markets and commerce. Fiat money gives governments greater flexibility to manage their own currency, set monetary policy, and stabilize global markets. It also allows for <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fractionalreservebanking.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fractional reserve banking</a>, which lets commercial banks multiply the amount of money on hand to meet demand from borrowers.\n", "\nVirtually every country today has legal tender that is fiat money. While you can buy and sell gold and gold coins, these are rarely used in exchange or for everyday purchases, and tend to be more of a collectible or speculative asset. Cryptocurrencies, such as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bitcoin.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bitcoin</a>, have emerged over the past decade as a challenge to the inflationary nature of fiat currencies; but despite increased interest and adoption, these virtual assets do not seem to approach being \"money\" in the traditional sense.\n", "\nSo far, most countries with fiat monies have experienced only moderate bouts of inflation, averaging less than 2% per year over the past several decades. In fact, having a consistent low level of inflation is seen as a positive driver or economic growth and investment as it encourages people to put their money to work rather than have it sit idle and lose purchasing power over time. While governments do have the theoretical capacity to print an \"infinite\" number of fiat currency units, they typically do not. Having a relatively strong and stable currency is not only a mandate of most modern central banks, but a rapidly devalued currency is harmful for trade and obtaining financing. Moreover, it is unclear whether or not hyperinflations are caused by \"runaway printing\" of money. In fact, hyperinflations have occurred throughout history, even when money was based on precious metals; and all contemporary hyperinflations have begun with a fundamental breakdown in the real production economy and/or political instability in the country.\n"]}
