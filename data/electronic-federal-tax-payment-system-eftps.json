However, users must plan ahead if using EFTPS. The service can only be used for payments after enrollment, a process that can take up to a week. While the system makes secure tax payments simple, it requires users to take a few steps beforehand. The\u00a0initial online registration is followed by physical mail sent to the address provided at registration. The mail includes verification of the bank account for the debiting of payments and a unique <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/personal-identification-number.asp\">personal identification number (PIN)</a>.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\u00a0\n", "\nThe IRS recommends using the\u00a0EFTPS to make <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/estimated-tax.asp\">estimated tax</a> payments.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff Taxpayers may schedule advance payments, which can be modified later if unexpected changes occur.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff Such changes can include a shortage of funds in the funding account.\n", "\nUsing an electronic password, taxpayers may access their personal and business tax records and accounts.
