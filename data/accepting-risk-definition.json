Also known as \"<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/complete-retention.asp\">risk retention</a>,\" it is an aspect of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskmanagement.asp\">risk management</a> commonly found in the business or investment fields.\n", "\nRisk acceptance posits that infrequent and small risks \u2014 ones that that do not have the ability to be catastrophic or otherwise too expensive\u00a0\u2014 are worth accepting with the acknowledgement that any problems will be dealt with if and when they arise.
