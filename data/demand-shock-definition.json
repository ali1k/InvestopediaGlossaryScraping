A positive demand shock is a sudden increase in demand, while a negative demand shock is a decrease in demand. Either shock will have an effect on the prices of the product or service.\n", "\nA demand shock may be contrasted with a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/supplyshock.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">supply shock</a>, which is a sudden change in the supply of a product or service that causes an observable economic effect.\n", "\nSupply and demand shocks are examples of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economic-shock.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">economic shocks</a>.\n", "\nA demand shock is a large but transitory disruption of the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market-price.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">market price</a> for a product or service, caused by an unexpected event that changes the perception and demand.\n", "\nAn earthquake, a terrorist event, a technological advance, and a government stimulus program can all cause a demand shock. So can a negative review, a product recall, or a surprising news event.\n", "\nWhen the demand for a good or service rapidly increases, its price typically increases because suppliers cannot cope with the increased demand. In economic\u00a0terms, this results in a shift in the demand curve to the right. A sudden drop in demand causes the opposite to happen. The supply in place is too great for the demand.\n", "\nOther demand shocks can come from the anticipation of a natural disaster or climate event, such as a run on bottled water, backup generators, or electric fans.\n", "\nA positive demand shock can come from fiscal policy, such as an economic stimulus or tax cuts. Negative demand shocks can come from <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/contractionary-policy.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">contractionary policy</a>, such as tightening the money supply or decreasing government spending. Whether positive or negative, these may be considered deliberate shocks to the system.\n", "\nThe rise of electric cars over the past few years is a real-world example of a demand shock. It was hard to predict the demand for electric cars and, therefore, for their component parts. Lithium batteries, for example, had low demand as recently as the mid-2000s.\n", "\nFrom 2010, the rise in the demand for electric cars from companies like Tesla Motors increased the overall market share of these cars to 3 percent, or roughly 2,100,000 vehicles. The demand for lithium batteries to power the cars also increased sharply, and somewhat unexpectedly.\n", "\nLithium is a limited natural resource that is difficult to extract and found only in certain parts of the world. Production has been unable to keep up with the growth in demand, and so the supply of newly mined lithium remains lower than it would be otherwise. The result is a demand shock.\n", "\nOver the period from 2004 to 2014, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/investing/why-lithium-stocks-are-plunging-amid-electric-car-boom/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">demand for lithium</a> more than doubled, increasing the price per metric ton from $5,180 in 2011 to $6,600 in 2014. Then, demand exploded for not only electric vehicles but battery-powered mobile phones and tablets.\n", "\nSince 2014, the price of lithium has more than doubled again, to $13,000 per metric ton in 2019, according to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2020/mcs2020-lithium.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">U.S. government statistics</a>. The cost has been passed onto the consumer, raising the cost of electric cars in a positive demand shock environment.\n", "\nThe cathode ray tube is an example of a negative demand shock. The introduction of low-cost flat-screen televisions caused the demand for cathode-ray tube TVs and computer screens to drop to nearly zero in a few short years. Not incidentally, the introduction of low-cost flat screens caused a once-common service job, the television repairman, to become virtually extinct.\n"]}
