But the number of firms in an industry does not necessarily indicate anything about market concentration, which is why calculating the HHI is important.\n", "\nFor example, assume an industry has 20 firms. Firm one has a market share of 48.59% and each of the 19 remaining firms has a market share of 2.71% each. The HHI would exactly 2,500, indicating a highly concentrated market. If firm number one had a market share of 35.82% and each of the remaining firms had a 3.38% market share, the HHI would be exactly 1,500, indicating a competitive marketplace.\n", "\nThe basic simplicity of the HHI carries some inherent disadvantages, primarily in terms of failing to define the specific market that is being examined in a proper, realistic manner. For example, consider a situation in which the HHI is used to evaluate an industry determined to have 10 active companies, and each company has about a 10% market share. Using the basic HHI calculation, the industry would appear highly competitive.\n", "\nHowever, within the marketplace, one company might have as much as 80% to 90% of the business for a specific segment of the market, such as the sale of one specific item. That firm would thus have nearly a total monopoly for the production and sale of that product.\n", "\nAnother problem in defining a market and considering market share can arise from geographic factors. This problem can occur when there are companies within an industry that have roughly equal market share, but they each operate only in specific areas of the country, so that each firm, in effect, has a monopoly within the specific marketplace in which it does business. For example, while the merger of Sprint and T-Mobile will increase the HHI value for the entire country by several hundred points, due to the fact that market share is concentrated in certain geographical areas, the index value would increase by more than 1,000 points in many markets.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff For these reasons, for the HHI to be properly used, other factors must be taken into consideration and markets must be very clearly defined.\n"]}
