The down version is a large down (black or red) candle followed by two white candles of similar size.

A continuation occurs 66% of the time. The pattern doesn't always produce large price moves. A little over 60% of the patterns produced a 6% average move in 10 days, and those patterns occurred in downtrends with a downside breakout from the pattern (downtrend continuation). Patterns occurring in other contexts didn't have as large of price moves, according to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/090916/top-5-books-learn-technical-analysis.asp\">Thomas Bulkowski's</a> candlestick research.\n", "\nUse other chart patterns or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technicalindicator.asp\">technical indicators</a> to confirm the candlestick pattern to maximize the odds of success.\n", "\nMany traders opt to wait for confirmation from the pattern. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/confirmation.asp\">Confirmation</a> is price movement that confirms the expectation of the pattern. For example, following an up gap side-by-side white lines pattern, a trader may wait for the price to move above the highs of the pattern before initiating a long position. A <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stop-lossorder.asp\">stop loss</a> could then be placed below the low of the second or third candle or even the first candle in order to give the trade more room.\n", "\nSuppose the security is engaged in an uptrend, with confident bulls expecting higher prices.

In the outside down pattern, a white candle is followed by two black candles.\n", "\nThe pattern is rare, which means finding it and opportunities to use it will be limited. The pattern has moderate reliability. This means that ideally the candlestick pattern should be coupled with other forms of analysis and confirmed by other trade signals.

The pattern served to act as a downtrend continuation pattern.\n", "\nThis pattern, and candlestick patterns in general, don't provide a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pricetarget.asp\">price target</a>.
