Rather than buying equipment outright, a company rents or leases it and then purchases it at a minimal price when the lease period ends. Choosing this option enabled a company to record only the rental cost for the equipment.

Look out for key words such as partnerships, rental, or lease expenses and cast a critical eye over them.\n", "\nInvestors can also contact company management to clarify if off-balance sheet financing (OBSF) agreements are being used and to hopefully determine how much they really affect liabilities.\n"]}
