href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/distressedsecurities.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">distressed companies</a>\u00a0that needed financial\u00a0restructuring.

Looking at the company's\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebitdacoverinterestratio.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio</a>\u00a0(in theory, at least) would give investors a sense of whether a company could meet the heavier interest payments it would face after restructuring. For instance, bankers might argue that a company with EBITDA of $5 million and interest charges of $2.5 million had interest coverage of two \u2013 more than enough to pay off debt.\n", "\nEBITDA was a popular metric in the 1980s to measure a company's ability to service the debt used in a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leveragedbuyout.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">leveraged buyout</a> (LBO). Using a limited measure of profits before a company has become fully leveraged in an LBO is appropriate. EBITDA was popularized further during the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dotcom-bubble.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\"dot com\" bubble</a> when companies had very expensive assets and debt loads that were obscuring what analysts and managers felt were legitimate growth numbers.\n", "\nThe use of EBITDA has since spread to a wide range of businesses. Its proponents argue that EBITDA offers a clearer reflection of operations by stripping out expenses that can obscure how the company is really performing.\n", "\nEBITDA is essentially net income (or earnings) with interest, taxes, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/depreciation.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">depreciation</a>, and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/amortization.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">amortization</a> added back. EBITDA can be used to analyze and compare profitability among companies and industries, as it eliminates the effects of financing and capital expenditures. EBITDA is often used in valuation ratios and can be compared to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/enterprisevalue.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">enterprise value</a> and revenue.\n", "\nInterest expenses and (to a lesser extent) interest income are added back to net income, which neutralizes the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/costofdebt.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cost of debt</a>, as well as the effect interest payments, have on taxes. Income taxes are also added back to net income, which does not always increase EBITDA if the company has a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/netloss.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">net loss</a>. Companies tend to spotlight their EBITDA performance when they do not have very impressive (or even positive) net income. It's not always a telltale sign of malicious market trickery, but it can sometimes be used to distract investors from the lack of real profitability.\n", "\nCompanies use depreciation and amortization accounts to expense the cost of property, plants, and equipment, or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital-investment.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">capital investments</a>.

This is one of the reasons that early-stage technology and research companies feature EBITDA when communicating with investors and analysts.\n", "\nManagement teams will argue that using EBITDA gives a better picture of profit growth trends when the expense accounts associated with capital are excluded. While there is nothing necessarily misleading about using EBITDA as a growth metric, it can sometimes overshadow a company's actual financial performance and risks.\n", "\nEBITDA does not fall under <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gaap.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">generally accepted accounting principles</a>\u00a0(GAAP) as a measure of financial performance. Because EBITDA is a \"non-GAAP\" measure, its calculation can vary from one company to the next. It is not uncommon for companies to emphasize EBITDA over net income because it is more flexible and can distract from other problem areas in the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-statements.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">financial statements</a>.\n", "\nAn important red flag for investors to watch is when a company starts to report EBITDA prominently when it hasn't done so in the past. This can happen when companies have borrowed heavily\u00a0or are experiencing rising capital and development costs. In this circumstance, EBITDA can serve as a distraction for investors and\u00a0may be misleading.\n", "\nA common misconception is that EBITDA represents cash earnings. However, unlike <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/freecashflow.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">free cash flow</a>, EBITDA ignores the cost of assets. One of the most common criticisms of EBITDA is that it assumes that profitability is a function of sales and operations alone \u2013 almost as if the assets and financing the company needs to survive were a gift.\n", "\nEBITDA also leaves out the cash required to fund <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/workingcapital.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">working capital</a> and the replacement of old equipment. For example, a company may be able to sell a product for a profit, but what did it use to acquire the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inventory.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">inventory</a> needed to fill its sales channels? In the case of a software company, EBITDA does not recognize the expense of developing the current software versions or upcoming products.\n", "\nWhile subtracting interest payments, tax charges, depreciation, and amortization from earnings may seem simple enough, different companies use different earnings figures as the starting point for EBITDA. In other words, EBITDA is susceptible to the earnings accounting games found on the income statement. Even if we account for the distortions that result from interest, taxation, depreciation, and amortization, the earnings figure in EBITDA is still unreliable.\n", "\nWorst of all, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/061515/which-metric-should-i-pay-more-attention-evebitda-or-pe.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">EBITDA</a> can make a company look less expensive than it really is. When analysts look at stock price multiples of EBITDA rather than bottom-line earnings, they produce lower multiples.\n", "\nConsider the historical example of wireless telecom operator Sprint Nextel. April 1, 2006, the stock was trading at 7.3 times its forecast EBITDA. That might sound like a low multiple, but it doesn't mean the company is a bargain. As a multiple of forecast operating profits, Sprint Nextel traded at a much higher 20 times. The company traded at 48 times its estimated net income. Investors need to consider other price multiples besides EBITDA when assessing a company's value.\n", "\nEarnings before interest,\u00a0taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) adds depreciation and amortization expenses back into a company's operating profit. Analysts usually rely on EBITDA to evaluate a company's ability to generate profits from sales alone and to make comparisons across similar companies with different capital structures. EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure and can sometimes be used intentionally to obscure the real profit performance of a company.\n", "\nBecause of these issues, EBITDA is featured more prominently by <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/developmentstage.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">developmental-stage</a> companies or those with heavy debt loads and expensive assets.\n", "\nThe measurement's sometimes bad reputation is mostly a result of overexposure and improper use. Just as a shovel is effective for digging holes, it wouldn't be the best tool for tightening screws or inflating tires. Thus, EBITDA shouldn't be used as a one-size-fits-all, stand-alone tool for evaluating corporate profitability. This is a particularly valid point when one considers that EBITDA calculations do not conform to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).\n", "\nLike any other measure, EBITDA is only a single indicator. To develop a full picture of the health of any given firm, a multitude of measures must be taken into consideration. If identifying great companies was as simple a checking a single number, everybody would be checking that number, and professional analysts would cease to exist.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebit.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">EBIT</a>\u00a0(<strong>e</strong>arnings\u00a0<strong>b</strong>efore\u00a0<strong>i</strong>nterest and\u00a0<strong>t</strong>axes) is a company's net income before income tax expense\u00a0and interest expense have been deducted.\u00a0EBIT is used to analyze the performance of a company's core operations without tax expenses and the costs of the capital structure\u00a0influencing profit.

However, once the operational expenses of depreciation and amortization are added back in, along with interest expense and taxes, the relationship between the two companies is more clear.\n", "\nIn this example, both companies have the same net income largely because Company B has a smaller interest expense account. There are a few possible conclusions that can help the analyst dig a little deeper into the true value of these two companies:\n", "\nYou can calculate EBITDA using the information from a company's income statement, cash flow statement, and balance sheet. The formula is as follows:\n", "\nEBITDA = Net Income + Interest + Taxes + Depreciation + Amortization\n", "\nEBITDA is a measure of a company's financial performance and profitability, so relatively high EBITDA is clearly better than lower EBITDA. Companies of different sizes in different sectors and industries vary widely in their financial performance. Therefore, the best way to determine whether a company's EBITDA is \"good\" is to compare its number with that of its peers\u2014companies of similar size in the same industry and sector.\n", "\nAs it relates to EBITDA, amortization is an accounting technique used to periodically lower the book value of intangible assets over a set period of time. Amortization is reported on a company's financial statements. Examples of intangible assets include intellectual property such as patents or trademarks, or goodwill derived from past acquisitions.\n"]}
