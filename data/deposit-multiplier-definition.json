The deposit multiplier is normally a percentage of the amount on deposit at the bank. The deposit multiplier requirement is key to maintaining an economy's basic <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/moneysupply.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">money supply</a>.

This is the amount of money all banks must keep on hand in their reserves. It allows them to function on a day-to-day basis, cutting the risk of depleting their supplies to satisfy <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/withdrawal.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">withdrawal</a> requests from their customers.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/centralbank.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Central banks</a> such as the Federal Reserve\u00a0in the United States establish minimum amounts to be held by banks. These are known as the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/requiredreserves.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">required reserve</a> or reserve requirement\u2014the amount of money available for a bank to lend to its customers. The bank must continually maintain this minimum in an account deposited at the central bank to ensure that it has sufficient cash to meet any withdrawal requests from its depositors.\n", "\nThe deposit multiplier is the inverse of the required reserves. So if the required reserve ratio is 20%, the deposit multiplier ratio is 80%. It is the ratio of the amount of a bank's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/checkable-deposits.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">checkable deposits</a>\u2014demand accounts against which <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/check.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">checks</a>, drafts, or other financial instruments can be negotiated\u2014to its reserve amount. So if the deposit multiplier is 80%, the bank must keep $1 in reserve for every $5 it has in deposits. The remaining $4 is available to the bank to lend out or invest.\n", "\nThe deposit multiplier provides the basis for the money multiplier, but the money multiplier value is ultimately less. That's because of excess reserves, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/savings.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">savings</a>, and conversions to cash by consumers. We go into more detail about money multiplier a little further down.\n", "\nA bank's deposit multiplier can be calculated using the following formula:\n", "\nThe deposit multiplier is frequently confused with the money multiplier. Although the two terms are closely related, they are not interchangeable and are distinctly different. The money multiplier reflects the change in a nation's money supply created by the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/loan.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">loan</a> of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">capital</a> beyond a bank's reserve. It can be seen as the maximum potential creation of money through the multiplied effect of all bank lending.\n", "\nIf banks loaned out every available dollar beyond their required reserves, and if borrowers spent every dollar they borrowed from banks, the deposit multiplier and the money multiplier would be essentially the same. In practice, banks do not lend out every dollar they have available. And not all borrowers spend every dollar they borrow. They may devote some of the cash to savings or other deposit <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/account.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">accounts</a>. That reduces the amount of money creation and the money multiplier figure that reflects it.\n"]}
