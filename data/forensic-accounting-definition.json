Forensic accounting provides an accounting analysis suitable to be used in legal proceedings. Forensic accountants are trained to look beyond the numbers and deal with the business reality of a situation. Forensic accounting is frequently used in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fraud.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fraud</a> and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/embezzlement.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">embezzlement</a> cases to explain the nature of a financial crime in court.\n", "\nForensic accountants analyze, interpret, and summarize complex financial and business matters. They may be employed by <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurance.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">insurance</a> companies, banks, police forces, government agencies, or public accounting firms. Forensic accountants compile financial evidence, develop computer applications to manage the information collected, and communicate their findings in the form of reports or presentations.\n", "\nAlong with testifying in court, a forensic accountant may be asked to prepare visual aids to support trial evidence. For business investigations, forensic accounting entails the use of tracing funds, asset identification, asset recovery, and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duediligence.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">due diligence</a> reviews. Forensic accountants may seek out additional training in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/alternative-dispute-resolution.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">alternative dispute resolution</a> (ADR) due to their high level of involvement in legal issues and familiarity with the judicial system.\n", "\nForensic accounting is utilized in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/litigation-risk.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">litigation</a> when quantification of damages is needed. Parties involved in legal disputes use the quantifications to assist in resolving disputes via settlements or court decisions. For example, this may arise due to compensation and benefit disputes. The forensic accountant may be utilized as an expert witness if the dispute escalates to a court decision.\n", "\nForensic accounting is also used to discover whether a crime occurred and assess the likelihood of criminal intent. Such crimes may include employee theft, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/securities-fraud.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">securities fraud</a>, falsification of financial statement information, identity theft, or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurance-fraud.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">insurance fraud</a>.\n", "\nForensic accounting is often brought to bear in complex and high profile financial crimes.

And, if all that wasn't enough, forensic accounting may also be used to determine the economic results of the breach of a nondisclosure or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/noncompete-agreement.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">non-compete agreement</a>.\n", "\nForensic accounting is routinely used by the insurance industry. In this capacity, a forensic accountant may be asked to quantify the economic damages arising from a vehicle accident, a case of medical malpractice, or some other <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurance_claim.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">claim</a>. One of the concerns about taking a forensic accounting approach to insurance claims as opposed to an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/claims-adjuster.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">adjuster approach</a> is that forensic accounting is mainly concerned with historical data and may miss relevant current information that changes the assumptions around the claim.\n"]}
