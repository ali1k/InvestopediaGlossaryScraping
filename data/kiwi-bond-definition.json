New Zealanders are often referred to as Kiwis, which is viewed as a term of endearment. A kiwi is a bird that is native to the region. The country\u2019s national rugby league team is also called the Kiwis.\n", "\nKiwi bonds are the main investment option available to individual <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investor.asp\">investors</a> living in New Zealand. As noted above, they are fully backed and secured by the country's government, which means they provide a higher degree of security for investors than bank-issued and <a class=\"pseudoStyle\" data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corporatebond.asp\">corporate bonds</a>.

The downside, though, is that Kiwi Bonds offer much lower <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp\">interest rates</a> than other bonds.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\"></span>\n", "\nKiwi bonds are denominated in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/forex/n/nzd-new-zealand-dollar.asp\">New Zealand dollars</a> (NZD) and mature in six months, one year, two years, and four years.

At least, for those investors observant enough to be paying attention. New Zealand was ahead of the curve in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic that has ravaged the global economy, which should further bolster confidence in that nation's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtinstrument.asp\">debt instruments</a> going forward.\n", "\nAlthough they provide a guaranteed investment return as well as security, there is a downside to investing in these bonds.

This means investors who want to make a decent profit off their investments in a short period of time\u2014and those who can tolerate a greater degree of risk\u2014likely won't want to put their money in these bonds.
