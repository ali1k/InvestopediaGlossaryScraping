Gaps are common when news causes market fundamentals to change during hours when markets are typically closed, for instance an earnings call after-hours.\n", "\nGaps typically occur when a piece of news or an event causes a flood of buyers or sellers into the security. It results in the price opening significantly higher or lower than the previous day\u2019s closing price. Depending on the kind of gap, it could indicate either the start of a new trend or a reversal of a previous trend.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gapping.asp\">Gapping</a> occurs when the price of a security or asset opens well above or below the previous day\u2019s\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/closingprice.asp\">close</a>\u00a0with no trading activity in between.\u00a0Partial gapping occurs when the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/openingprice.asp\">opening price</a>\u00a0is higher or lower than the previous day\u2019s close but within the previous day\u2019s price range. Full gapping occurs when the open is outside of the previous day\u2019s range. Gapping, especially a full gap, shows a strong shift in sentiment occurred overnight.\n", "\nSome traders make it a strategy to profit from <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/05/playinggaps.asp\">playing the gap</a> when such a situation occurs.\n", "\nThere are some fundamental differences between the different types of gaps: \u2013 <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commongap.asp\">Common Gaps</a>, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/breakawaygap.asp\">Breakaway Gaps</a>, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/runawaygap.asp\">Runaway Gaps</a>, and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exhaustiongap.asp\">Exhaustion Gaps</a>.\n", "\nEach type of gap has certain consequences for traders. For example, reversal or breakaway gaps are typically accompanied by a sharp rise in trading volume, while common and runaway gaps are not. Additionally, most gaps occur due to news, or an event such as earnings or an analyst's upgrade/downgrade.\n", "\nCommon gaps happen more regularly and do not always need a reason to occur. Also, common gaps tend to get filled, whereas the other two gaps may signal a reversal or continuation of a trend.\n", "\nIn the historical example below, Amazon.com Inc. (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=amzn\">AMZN</a>) stock gaps higher on October 27, 2017, rising sharply from the previous days close after months of sideways consolidation. The stock's gain is accompanied by a massive increase in volume, confirming a breakaway gap. It is the start of a new trend higher in Amazon\u2019s stock, which goes on to rally from $985 to $2,050 by September 2018.\n", "\nIn the next example, Alphabet Inc.\u2019s (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=googl\">GOOGL</a>) chart shows a runaway gap. Alphabet\u2019s stock was already increasing in April 2017 when it gapped sharply higher, continuing its previous uptrend.\u00a0\n", "\nThere are limitations despite gaps being easy to spot. The glaring flaw is one's own ability to identify the different types of gap that occur. If a gap is misinterpreted, it could be a disastrous mistake causing one to miss an opportunity to either buy or sell a security, which could weigh heavily on one's profits and losses.\n"]}
