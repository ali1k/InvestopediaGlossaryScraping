These factors allow the productive entity to generate more sales or superior margins compared to its market rivals.\n", "\nCompetitive advantages are attributed to a variety of factors\u00a0including cost structure, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-theory/11/branding-ultimate-economic-moat.asp\">branding</a>, the quality of product offerings, the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/distribution-network.asp\">distribution network</a>, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intellectualproperty.asp\">intellectual property</a>, and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/customer-service.asp\">customer service</a>.\n", "\nCompetitive advantages generate greater value for a firm and its shareholders\u00a0because of certain strengths or conditions. The more sustainable the competitive advantage, the more difficult it is for competitors to neutralize the advantage. The two main types of competitive advantages are <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/comparativeadvantage.asp\">comparative advantage</a> and differential advantage.\n", "\nA firm's ability to produce a good or service more efficiently than its competitors, which leads to greater profit margins, creates a comparative advantage. Rational consumers will choose the cheaper of any two perfect substitutes offered. For example, a car owner will\u00a0buy gasoline from a\u00a0gas station that is 5 cents cheaper\u00a0than other stations in the area. For imperfect substitutes, like Pepsi versus Coke, higher margins for the lowest-cost producers can eventually bring superior returns.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economiesofscale.asp\">Economies of scale</a>, efficient internal systems, and geographic location can also create a comparative advantage. Comparative advantage does not imply a\u00a0better product or service, though. It only shows the firm can offer a product or service of the same value at\u00a0a lower price.\n", "\nFor example, a firm that manufactures a product in China may have lower labor costs than a company that manufactures in the U.S., so it can offer an equal product at a lower price. In the context of international trade economics, opportunity cost\u00a0determines comparative advantages.\u00a0\n", "\nAmazon (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=amzn\">AMZN</a>)\u00a0is an example of a company focused on building and maintaining a comparative advantage. The e-commerce platform\u00a0has a level of scale and efficiency that is difficult for retail competitors to replicate, allowing it to\u00a0rise\u00a0to prominence largely through price competition.\n", "\nA differential advantage is\u00a0when a firm's products or services differ from its competitors' offerings and are seen as superior. Advanced technology, patent-protected products or processes, superior personnel, and strong brand identity are all drivers of differential advantage. These factors support wide margins and large market shares.\n", "\nApple is famous for creating innovative products, such as\u00a0the iPhone, and supporting its market leadership with savvy marketing campaigns to build an elite brand. Major drug companies can also market branded drugs at high price points because they are protected by patents.\n", "\nIf a business is able to increase its market share through increased efficiency or productivity, it would have a competitive advantage over its competitors.\n", "\nTo find a lasting competitive advantage, look for something that your competitors cannot easily replicate or imitate. Esteemed investor Warren Buffet identifies \"moats\" that businesses can figuratively dig around themselves to entrench competitive advantages. Buffett's moat refers to a defensive barrier, but instead of protecting a castle, it helps prevent a company's profits from being eroded by competitors. This can include strengthening one's brand, raising barriers to new entrants (such as through regulations), and the defense of intellectual property.\n", "\nCompetitive advantages that accrue from economies of scale typically refer to supply-side advantages, such as the purchasing power of a large restaurant or retail chain. But advantages of scale also exist on the demand side, too; they are commonly referred to as\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/network-effect.asp\">network effects</a>.\u00a0They are at work when a service becomes more valuable to all of its users as the service adds more users. The result can often be a winner-take-all dynamic in the industry.\n", "\nComparative advantage mostly refers to international trade. It posits that a country should focus on what it can produce and export relatively the cheapest - thus, if one country has a competitive advantage in producing both products A &amp; B, it should only produce product A if it can do it better than B and import B from some other country.\n"]}
