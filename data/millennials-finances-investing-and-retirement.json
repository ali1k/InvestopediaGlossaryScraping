They want a job that allows a great work/life balance while they're young so they don\u2019t have to wait to travel, create their own <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/non-profitorganization.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">non-profit</a> or pursue hobbies. They may even be planning not to retire at all because they love their work.\n", "\nMany millennials see themselves working forever, but not because they expect to be forced into that situation by a bad economy or poor financial planning. They envision a lifelong career because of their passion for what they do.\n", "\n\u201cI have taken a very different approach than my parents,\u201d says Michael Solari, a thirtysomething <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cfp.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Certified Financial Planner</a> and principal with Solari Financial Planning, a New Hampshire-based, fee-only financial planning firm with offices in Bedford and Nashua. \u201cInitially, when I got out of college I took the normal path working for a large company, but after I got laid off in 2009 I decided to take my career in my own hands,\u201d he says. \u201cI love financial planning, so I started working toward creating my own firm.\u201d\n", "\nLast year Solari launched his company, which caters to young professionals. \u201cI'm so happy with my decision, and I plan to work until I can't physically,\u201d he says. He enjoys the ability to create his own schedule to give him a work-life balance, which is most important to him because he observed his parents being strapped to their companies. \u201cRetirement is for people who are unhappy with their careers,\u201d Solari says.\n", "\nEven if you\u2019re planning to work throughout your life like Solari is, you still need to save for retirement; you also need a safety net in case you can\u2019t work forever because of illness or disability\u2014or because you're pushed out of your job and can't find another. And if one day you change your mind, as priorities you\u2019ll appreciate having the flexibility that retirement savings will give you. Making your money work for you is a good idea no matter what your life plans are. If you're young, it doesn't take much: Investing $100 per month in the stock market for the next 30 years would give you $117,000, assuming a 7% return; make that investment for the next 40 years and you\u2019ll end up with more than $248,000.\n", "\nAnother smart financial move is buying <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/disability-insurance.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">long-term disability insurance</a> while you\u2019re young and healthy, which qualifies you for better <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurance-premium.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">premiums</a>.\n", "\nPerhaps the best-known advocate of retiring incredibly early in life is Jacob Lund Fisker, creator of the Early Retirement Extreme website\u00a0and author of\u00a0a book by the same name. Fisker, a native of Denmark who became a permanent U.S. resident at age 31, writes that his current <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/networth.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">net worth</a> is 64 years\u2019 worth of his annual expenses and that his <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/passiveincome.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">passive income</a> is twice what he needs. He achieved financial security and a fulfilling lifestyle despite an unimpressive income and now lives on about $7,000 a year, despite being in the pricey San Francisco Bay Area.\n", "\nExtreme early retirement isn\u2019t for everyone. You must be willing to be \u201cweird\u201d by doing things such as limiting your household food budget to $50\u2013$75 per person per month,\u00a0not owning a car,\u00a0foregoing cable television, eschewing a fancy wedding and pricey honeymoon, skipping grad school unless you receive a full scholarship and shunning expensive housing. By sacrificing a consumer-driven lifestyle, you may be able to amass a large enough nest egg at a relatively young age to be able to retire very early, even at 30 as Fisker did, and live off your <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investmentincome.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">investment income</a>. Some ways to build that sizeable nest egg early in your life: a decade of exceptionally hard work, amazing entrepreneurial success or stock-sale proceeds from the startup you helped get off the ground. Needless to say, it's a formula not everyone can employ.\n", "\nBut if you can, and have the willingness to color outside the lines of what most Americans consider normal, retiring early means learning to create and follow a budget, and to invest in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indexfund.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">index funds</a> and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ETFs</a>. You\u2019ll have to get <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/healthinsurance.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">health insurance,</a> but you might choose to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/self-insure.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">self-insure</a> in other areas.\u00a0You\u2019ll need an emergency fund (everyone does). You\u2019ll also need to do the math to figure out how much wealth you need to accumulate, how quickly and the rate at which you can safely withdraw it to meet your lifestyle goals while preserving enough principal to keep generating income. But if time is more important to you than money, Fisker writes, you may find that you need much less than the recommended $1 million in retirement savings and can, therefore, accumulate your needed savings rapidly.\n", "\nJohn Crabtree, 28, of Sodus, Mich., calls himself effectively partially retired. His work as a maintenance contractor at nuclear plants during refueling outages mostly takes place in spring and fall, giving him summers and winters off. \u201cWe live relatively frugally and save 30% of our income,\u201d he says. \u201c20% goes into tax-advantaged retirement accounts and 10% goes towards paying our house down early. We plan on having the house paid off before our children start college and have built enough wealth that we can retire by age 45.\u201d He says that he really enjoys his job and may choose to work eight to 12 weeks a year in early retirement.\n", "\nLiving a partially retired lifestyle is the most moderate approach, but perhaps trickiest to plan for financially, because you have one foot in the work-forever camp and one foot in the extreme-early-retirement camp. Your pool of potential jobs shrinks because 40-hour work weeks aren\u2019t for you; you basically need a part-time job with better-than-part-time pay so you can not only afford to work less now, but also\u00a0save for the future. You might achieve this goal through <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/1212/6-top-paying-freelance-jobs.aspx\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">freelancing</a> on your own schedule or by running or working for a location-independent business that lets you combine work and travel, work and culinary school, work and volunteering, or work and whatever your vocation is.\n", "\nAs with retiring early, budgeting and minimizing costs are key; this will let you live off the income from fewer hours of work and afford any expenses associated with your non-work activities. Your long-term saving and investment strategy should be based on whether you want partial retirement now plus working forever\u2014or partial retirement now plus a conventional retirement (or if you\u2019re really extraordinary, partial retirement now and early retirement).\n", "\nDavid J. Bradley, a 23-year-old entrepreneur and MBA student based in Providence, R.I., sums up how many millennials feel about retirement\u2014and by extension, life.\n", "\n\u201cThe retirement experience should be lived throughout life,\u201d he says. \u201cIt might take some extra work and building passive income streams for the future,\u201d but he doesn\u2019t want to wait 40 years to enjoy the benefits. \u201cI want to travel while I'm young, make my schedule fit what I want to do more than what others tell me to do, and live my ideal life,\u201d he says. While his values force him to be mindful of how he spends his money, he focuses his <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/discretionaryincome.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">discretionary income</a> on taking at least one vacation each year and pursuing different activities and experiences as often as he can.\n", "\n\u201cThat's what retirement, the golden age of our lives, is all about, after all, right?\u201d Bradley says. \u201cSo why not start now if we can?\u201d\n"]}
