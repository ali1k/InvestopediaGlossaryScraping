Typically, revenue is recognized when a critical event has occurred, and the dollar amount is easily measurable to the company.\n", "\nRevenue is at the heart of all business performance. Everything hinges on the sale. As such, regulators know how tempting it is for companies to push the limits on what qualifies as revenue, especially when not all revenue is collected when the work is complete. For example, attorneys charge their clients in billable hours and present the invoice after work is completed. Construction managers often bill clients on a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/percentage-of-completion-method.asp\">percentage-of-completion</a> method.\n", "\nRevenue accounting is fairly straightforward when a product is sold, and the revenue is recognized when the customer pays for the product. However, accounting for revenue can get complicated when a company takes a long time to produce a product. As a result, there are several situations in which there can be exceptions to the revenue recognition principle.\n", "\nAnalysts, therefore, prefer that the revenue recognition policies for one company are also standard for the entire industry. Having a standard revenue recognition guideline helps to ensure that an apples-to-apples comparison can be made between companies when reviewing line items on the income statement. Revenue recognition principles within a company should remain constant over time as well, so historical financials can be analyzed and reviewed for seasonal trends or inconsistencies.\n", "\nThe revenue recognition principle, a feature of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accrualaccounting.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">accrual accounting</a>, requires that revenues are recognized on the income statement in the period when realized and earned\u2014not necessarily when cash is received.\u00a0Realizable means that goods or services have been received by the customer, but payment for the good or service is expected later.\u00a0Earned revenue accounts for goods or services that have been provided or performed, respectively.\n", "\nThe revenue-generating activity must be fully or essentially complete for it to be included in revenue during the respective accounting period.

ASC 606 provides a uniform framework for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers. The old guidance was industry-specific, which created a system of fragmented policies.
