The double declining balance (DDB) method is a type of declining balance method that instead uses double the normal depreciation rate.\n", "\nDepreciation rates used in the declining balance method could be 150%, 200% (double), or 250% of the straight-line rate. When the depreciation rate for the declining balance method is set as a multiple doubling the straight-line rate, the declining balance method is effectively the double declining balance method. Over the depreciation process, the double depreciation rate remains constant and is applied to the reducing <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bookvalue.asp\">book value</a> each depreciation period. The book value, or depreciation base, of an asset declines over time. With the constant double depreciation rate and a successively lower depreciation base, charges calculated with this method continually drop. The balance of the book value is eventually reduced to the asset's salvage value after the last depreciation period. However, the final depreciation charge may have to be limited to a lesser amount to keep the salvage value as estimated.\n", "\nUnder the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gaap.asp\">generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)</a> for public companies, expenses are recorded in the same period as the revenue that is earned as a result of those expenses.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\"></span> Thus, when a company purchases an expensive asset that will be used for many years, it does not deduct the entire purchase price as a business expense in the year of purchase but instead deducts the price over several years.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\"></span>\n", "\nBecause the double <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/decliningbalancemethod.asp\">declining balance method</a> results in larger depreciation expenses near the beginning of an asset\u2019s life\u2014and smaller depreciation expenses later on\u2014it makes sense to use this method with assets that lose value quickly.\n", "\nAs a hypothetical example, suppose a business purchased a $30,000 delivery truck, which was expected to last for 10 years. After 10 years, it would be worth $3,000, its salvage value.\u00a0Under the straight-line depreciation method, the company would deduct $2,700 per year for 10 years \u2013 that is, $30,000 minus $3,000, divided by 10.\n", "\nUsing the double declining balance method, however, it would deduct 20% of $30,000 ($6,000) in year one, 20% of $24,000 ($4,800) in year two, and so on.\n", "\n<br/>\n", "\nDepreciation is an accounting process by which a company allocates an asset's cost throughout its\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/usefullife.asp\">useful life</a>. In other words, it records how the value of an asset declines over time.\u00a0Firms depreciate assets on their financial statements and for tax purposes in order to better match an asset's productivity in use to its costs of operation over time.\n", "\nAccelerated depreciation is any method of\u00a0depreciation\u00a0used for accounting or income tax purposes that allows greater depreciation expenses in the early years of the life of an asset. Accelerated depreciation methods, such as double-declining balance (DDB), means there will be higher depreciation expenses in the first few years and lower expenses as the asset ages. This is unlike the\u00a0straight-line depreciation\u00a0method, which spreads the cost evenly over the life of an asset.\n", "\nBoth DDB and ordinary declining depreciation are accelerated methods. The difference is that DDB will use a depreciation rate that is twice that (double) of the one used in standard declining depreciation.\n", "\nDDB is ideal for assets that very rapidly lose their values or quickly become obsolete. This may be true with certain computer equipment, mobile devices, and other high-tech items, which are generally useful earlier on but become less so as newer models are brought to market.\n"]}
