Fiat money includes legal tender such as paper money, checks, drafts, and banknotes.\n", "\nLawful money is also known as \"specie,\" which means \"in actual form.\"\n", "\nOddly enough, the dollar bills that we carry around in our wallets are not considered lawful money.

Since some currencies that could be used by national banking associations as \"lawful money reserves\" were not considered legal tender, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/congress.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Congress</a> amended the Federal Reserve Act in 1933 to include all U.S. coins and currency as legal tender for all purposes.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nThe 1933 amendment extended the power of legal tender to all types of money, creating dissension on whether paper money and reserves of the Federal Reserve bank are lawful money.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff While some argue that Federal Reserve notes are lawful money, others tend to disagree.\n", "\nSince the US Constitution states \u201cno state shall make any thing but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts,\u201d some believe that this is the definition of lawful money and, thus, any payment medium other than <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/09/why-gold-matters.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">gold</a> or silver is not considered lawful money. In effect, the primary meaning of lawful money is legal tender, but a broader interpretation is frequently applied in certain contexts.\n", "\nBecause no legal definition of lawful money was ever provided, the term has led to a lot of confusion, primarily in legal aspects. For all intents and purposes, lawful money should mean legal tender but is not always the case. This has caused a lot of confusion for students of law and banking.\n", "\nProfessionals believe that Congress should pass a simple statute stating what lawful money is, ensuring it includes all forms of U.S. currency, particularly since the use of gold and silver is not a regular occurrence anymore.\n", "\nLawful money is separate from the classification of money, which is broken down as M0, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/m1.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">M1</a>, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/m2.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">M2</a>, and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/m3.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">M3</a>.
