The cost of living is often used to compare how expensive it is to live in one city versus another. The cost of living is tied to wages. If expenses are higher in a city, such as New York, for example, salary levels must be higher so that people can afford to live in that city.\n", "\nThe cost of living can be a significant factor in personal wealth accumulation\u00a0because a salary can provide a higher <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/06/lifeplanning.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">standard of living</a> in a\u00a0city where daily expenses such as rent, food and entertainment are less. In contrast, a high salary can seem insufficient in an expensive city such as New York. In a 2018 survey, Mercer, a global human resources firm, finds the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www.mercer.com/newsroom/cost-of-living-2018.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">cities with the highest cost of living</a> include Hong Kong; Luanda, the capital of Angola; Tokyo; Zurich and Singapore, in that order.\u00a0New York City was ranked the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/080916/top-10-most-expensive-cities-us.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">costliest city in the United States</a> followed by San Francisco and Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington and Boston.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nThe\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/100214/how-cost-living-index-calculated.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cost of living index</a> compares the cost of living in a major city to a corresponding metropolitan area. The index incorporates the expense of various living expenses creating an aggregate measure that workforce entrants can use as a benchmark. As college graduates weigh employment alternatives and currently employed job seekers consider relocation, the index provides an informative snapshot of rental, transportation and grocery costs.\n", "\nDifferent indexes may calculate living expenses differently. For example, in 2018, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/real-estate/T006-S001-most-expensive-u-s-cities-to-live-in-2018/index.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kiplinger</a>\u00a0found San Diego to be the most expensive city based on the Council for Community and Economic Research, not New York City. The Council's cost of living index measured prices in 269 urban areas for expenses such as housing, groceries, utilities, transportation and healthcare, even getting a\u00a0haircut\u00a0or going to a movie. In the case of San Diego, the cost of housing is 138% above the national average, and the cost of transportation is over 20% higher than the national average.\n", "\nThe rising cost of living has spurred debate over\u00a0the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/07/minimum_wage.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">U.S. federal minimum wage</a> and\u00a0the disparity between the lowest salary allowed by law and the earnings needed to maintain an adequate cost of living. Proponents of a hike in wages cite increased worker productivity levels since 1968 as inequitably correlated to the minimum hourly rate of pay. As pay levels once tracked the increase in productivity, the divergence between earnings and worker efficiency has\u00a0reached historically disproportionate levels. By contrast, opponents of a minimum wage contend that a raise could spur higher consumer prices as employers offset rising labor costs.\n", "\nIn 1973, Congress enacted legislation to address <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/latestCOLA.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cost-of-living adjustments</a> (COLAs).
