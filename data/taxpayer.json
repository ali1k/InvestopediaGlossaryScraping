Taxes from both individuals and businesses are a primary source of revenue for governments. In the United States, individual taxpayers are usually required to file and pay both federal and state tax returns annually. Businesses must also file annual returns but usually plan for and pay regular estimated tax payments throughout the year.\n", "\nUnited States tax code is legislated and enforced by federal, state, and local governments. The Internal Revenue Service is the primary governing agency overseeing implemented <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incometax.asp\">income tax</a> code for both individuals and businesses.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff State and local revenue agencies are responsible for implementing and enforcing localized taxes such as sales taxes and property taxes. Both individuals and businesses must be aware of their tax obligations since not paying necessary taxes can result in penalties or further legal actions.\n", "\nThere are specific thresholds governing the obligation to pay annual individual income taxes to the Internal Revenue Service (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irs.asp\">IRS</a>) and state revenue departments. The federal threshold is based on an individual\u2019s filing status. Each state will also have its own thresholds. Individual taxpayers should check both the federal and state thresholds to determine their filing obligations for a given year. The Internal Revenue Service\u2019s Publication 501: Dependents, Standard Deduction, and Filing Information provides federal tax guidance for individual taxpayers.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nAn individual\u2019s filing status will influence how much tax is withheld from payroll. It is also a primary factor influencing annual tax obligations for a given year. Therefore, it is important that an individual taxpayer maintain the same filing status with their employer that they plan to use for their annual tax filing. Improperly notating the tax filing status on employee withholding forms like the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/w4form.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Form W-4</a> can result in withholding too much or too little which will be reconciled at tax-filing time.\n", "\nGenerally, marriage and dependents (usually children) are the two things that will characterize a taxpayer\u2019s status.

The federal threshold for filing a tax return is detailed by filing status below. Individual states follow similar status standards but can have differing thresholds. Some people may not need to file tax returns at all. Some people may benefit from filing a return even if below thresholds because they can be paid a refund with applicable deductions and credits.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"13\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nIndividual taxpayers need a social security number to file tax returns.
