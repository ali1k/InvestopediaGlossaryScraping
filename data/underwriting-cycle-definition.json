A typical underwriting cycle spans a number of years, as market conditions for the underwriting business go from boom to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bust.asp\">bust</a> and back to boom again. An underwriting cycle is also known as\u00a0an \"insurance cycle.\"\n", "\nThe underwriting\u00a0cycle represents the ebb and flow of business\u00a0between\u00a0soft and\u00a0hard insurance markets.\u00a0At the beginning of an underwriting\u00a0cycle,\u00a0business is soft due to increased competition and excess insurance capacity, as a result of which <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurance-premium.asp\">premiums</a> are low. Then, a natural disaster or other event\u00a0leads to a surge in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurance_claim.asp\">insurance claims</a>, which drives lesser-capitalized insurers out of business.\n", "\nDecreased competition and lower insurance capacity lead to better underwriting conditions for\u00a0surviving insurers, enabling them to raise premiums and post solid <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earnings.asp\">earnings</a> growth. As the insurance claims are paid off and the tide of new claims subsides,\u00a0insurance companies slowly return to profitability.\u00a0New insurance companies then enter the market, offering lower premiums and looser requirements than the existing companies.\u00a0The existing companies are then compelled to\u00a0loosen their requirements to stay competitive, and the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurance.asp\">insurance</a> cycle starts all over again.\n", "\nThe underwriting cycle perpetuates because a majority of\u00a0insurance companies\u00a0place short-term gains over long-term stability, selling insurance without concern for what happens when the soft market ends.\u00a0The only way to effectively regulate or insulate an insurance company against\u00a0the effects of the\u00a0insurance cycle is to ignore short-term profitability and focus on saving capital. An insurance company may also consider establishing limits and setting\u00a0money\u00a0aside in a \"rainy day\" type of account. Disciplined efficiency can have a considerable effect on a firm's financial stability and long-term business prospects.\n", "\nAs with most <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/businesscycle.asp\">business cycles</a>, the underwriting cycle is a phenomenon that is very difficult to eliminate. The concept has been an understood phenomenon\u00a0since at least the 1920s\u00a0and has since been treated as a core concept in the industry.\u00a0In 2006, insurance giant <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lloyds-london.asp\">Lloyd's of London</a> identified managing this cycle as the top challenge facing the insurance industry and published a report by surveying more than 100 underwriters about industry issues. In response to their survey, they were able to identify steps to manage the insurance cycle.\n", "\nMost insurance industry watchdog organizations\u00a0believe that underwriting cycles are inevitable due to the inherent uncertainty of\u00a0matching insurance prices to future\u00a0losses. Unfortunately, the industry as a whole is not responding to the challenges the underwriting cycle brings. The underwriting cycle affects all types of insurance except <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lifeinsurance.asp\">life insurance</a>, where there is enough information to minimize risk and reduce the effect of the underwriting cycle.\n"]}
