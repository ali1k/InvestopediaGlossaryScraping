A U-shaped recovery represents the shape of the chart of certain economic measures, such as employment, GDP, and industrial output. This shape occurs when the economy experiences a sharp decline in these metrics without a clearly defined trough but instead a period of stagnation followed by a relatively healthy rise back to its previous peak. A U-shaped recovery is similar to a V-shaped recovery except that the economy spends a longer time slogging along the bottom of the recession rather than immediately rebounding.\n", "\nA U-shaped recovery describes a type of economic recession and recovery that charts a U shape, established when certain metrics, such as employment, GDP, and industrial output sharply decline and then remain depressed typically over a period of 12 to 24 months before they bounce back again.\u00a0\n", "\nSimon Johnson, former chief economist for the<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/imf.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> International Monetary Fund</a>, described a U-shaped recession like a bathtub in an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/id/32417053\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">interview with PBS</a> in 2009. \u201cYou go in.

The economy began to shrink in early 1973 and continued to decline or show only slight growth over the next two years, with the GDP dipping 3 percent at its deepest point before finally recovering in 1975.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff The roots to this recession lay in the inflationary policies of the preceding years to simultaneously finance the Vietnam War and the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/great-society.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Great Society</a> welfare state expansion under President Johnson, Keynesian deficit spending policies under President Nixon after him, and the resulting break of the last links between the U.S. dollar and gold.\u00a0\n", "\nThe onset of the recession was marked by the 1973 oil crisis and increased oil prices as well as the 1973\u201374 stock market crash, one of the worst stock market downturns in modern history, which affected all the major stock markets in the world. The recovery was marked by persistently high unemployment and accelerating inflation that would characterize the 1970\u2019s as the era of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stagflation.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">stagflation</a>.\u00a0\n", "\nThe deregulation of banks and savings &amp; loans in the early 1980\u2019s kicked off a boom in commercial and residential real estate lending that really took off as the Fed loosened monetary policy and interest rates fell after the economy emerged from recession in 1982.
