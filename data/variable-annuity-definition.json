Variable annuities differ from <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixedannuity.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fixed annuities</a>, which provide a specific and guaranteed return.\n", "\nThere are two elements that contribute to the value of a variable annuity: the principal, which is the amount of money you pay into the annuity, and the returns that your annuity\u2019s underlying investments deliver on that principal over the course of time.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nThe most popular type of variable annuity is a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deferredannuity.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">deferred annuity</a>. Often used for retirement planning purposes, it is meant to provide a regular (monthly, quarterly, annual) income stream, starting at some point in the future. There are also <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/immediatepaymentannuity.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">immediate annuities</a>, which begin paying income right away.\n", "\nYou can buy an annuity with either a lump sum or a series of payments, and the account\u2019s value will grow accordingly. In the case of deferred annuities, this is often referred to as the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accumulationphase.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">accumulation phase</a>. The second phase is triggered when the annuity owner asks the insurer to start the flow of income, often referred to as the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/payoutphase.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">payout phase</a>.

Variable annuities gave buyers a chance to benefit from rising markets by investing in a menu of mutual funds offered by the insurer. The upside was the possibility of higher returns during the accumulation phase and a larger income during the payout phase. The downside was that the buyer was exposed to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketrisk.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">market risk</a>, which could result in losses. With a fixed annuity, by contrast, the insurance company assumes the risk of delivering whatever return it has promised.\n", "\nIn deciding whether to put money into a variable annuity versus some other type of investment, it\u2019s worth weighing these pros and cons.\n", "\nBelow are some details for each side.\n", "\nBefore buying a variable annuity, investors should carefully read the prospectus to try to understand the expenses, risks, and formulas for calculating investment gains or losses.\ufeff <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/investing/overview-of-annuities/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Annuities are complicated products</a>, so that may be easier said than done.\n", "\nBear in mind that between the numerous fees\u2014such as investment management fees,\u00a0mortality fees, and administrative fees\u2014and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/retirement/07/annuity-benefits-fine-print.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">charges for any additional riders</a>, a variable annuity\u2019s\u00a0expenses can quickly add up.
