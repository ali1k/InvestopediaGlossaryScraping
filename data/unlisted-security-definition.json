Trading of unlisted securities is done on the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otc.asp\">over-the-counter</a> (OTC) market and they are often called OTC securities. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketmaker.asp\">Market makers</a>, or dealers, facilitate the buying and selling of unlisted securities on the OTC market.\n", "\nUnlisted securities are usually issued by smaller or new firms that cannot or do not wish to comply with the requirements of an official <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exchange.asp\">exchange</a>, such as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/investing/market-capitalization-defined/\">market capitalization</a> thresholds or listing fees.\u00a0Furthermore, because they are not exchange traded, unlisted securities are often less liquid than <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/listedsecurity.asp\">listed securities</a>. Unlisted stock can be tracked via <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pinksheets.asp\">pink sheets</a> or on the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"5\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otcbb.asp\">Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board</a> (OTCBB).\n", "\nSecurities must meet a number of requirements to be listed on an exchange. For example, to be listed on the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nyse.asp\">New York Stock Exchange</a> (NYSE), a publicly traded stock must represent a company that surpasses an annual income or market capitalization threshold. The company also must have issued a specific number of shares and be able to afford the exchange's listing fee.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\"></span>\n", "\nThese requirements ensure that only the highest quality companies trade on exchanges. Thus, unlisted securities may be of lower quality and present a greater risk to investors.\n", "\nThe most familiar type of unlisted security is common stock, often traded on the\u00a0OTCBB or\u00a0the pink sheets. This includes <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pennystock.asp\">penny stocks</a>, which trade\u00a0for extremely low prices, while some are legitimate foreign companies that don't wish to file reports with the SEC.\n", "\nThere are also many unlisted non-stock instruments including <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corporatebond.asp\">corporate bonds</a>, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/governmentsecurity.asp\">government securities</a>, and certain derivative products such as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/swap.asp\">swaps</a> which are traded in the OTC market.\n", "\nThe normal risks associated with investing are magnified with unlisted securities. Because size and other requirements for companies are reduced or eliminated, some unlisted companies may be <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/undercapitalization.asp\">undercapitalized</a>, have highly risky business plans, and be no more than an idea without a plan for success.\n", "\nOther unlisted transactions carry <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/counterpartyrisk.asp\">counterparty risk</a>, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp\">liquidity</a> concerns, and interconnection risks. This can include one side reneging on the contract. Also, since there is no formal exchange or clearing mechanism, it is up to the reputation of dealers and/or counterparties to fulfill all obligations of the transactions, including delivery of securities and payment of any monies required.\n"]}
