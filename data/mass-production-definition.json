Mass production facilitates the efficient production of\u00a0a large number\u00a0of similar products.\n", "\nMass production is also referred to as flow production, repetitive flow production, series production, or serial production.\n", "\nIn mass production, mechanization is used to achieve high volume, detailed organization of material flow, careful control of quality standards, and division of labor. An early example of the demand for standardized\u00a0products in large quantities came from military organizations and their need for uniforms and other supplies. Precision machining equipment has led to large-scale demand for mass-produced products\u00a0created cheaply with small workforces.\n", "\nMass production has many advantages. If production is stringently monitored, mass production can result in a high level of precision because production line machines have\u00a0preset parameters. Mass production also results in lower costs because the automated assembly line production process requires fewer workers.\n", "\nIn addition, mass production can create higher levels of efficiency because mass-produced items can be assembled at a quicker rate through automation. Rapid assembly aids the prompt distribution and marketing of an organization's products that, in turn, can create a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/competitive_advantage.asp\">competitive advantage</a> and higher profits for a company. For example, McDonald's (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=mcd\">MCD</a>) has a competitive advantage in the fast-food industry because of the speed at which it can produce a meal for time-conscious customers.\n", "\nHowever, not everything about mass production is beneficial. Establishing an automated assembly line is capital-intensive and requires a significant upfront investment of time and resources. If there is an error in the production design, an extensive investment of time and money may be necessary to redesign and rebuild mass production processes.\u00a0\n", "\nA revision of the mass production processes may be required for reasons other than errors. For example, if a pharmaceutical company has a comprehensive assembly line in place for the production of a popular drug, it would be time-consuming and expensive for them to respond to a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fda.asp\">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) regulatory change requiring a different production process.\n", "\nWhile an advantage of mass production is that it can reduce labor costs, employees who remain part of an assembly line may lack motivation because their\u00a0tasks are repetitive. The boredom caused by repetitive work can lead to low employee morale and increased levels of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/turnover.asp\">turnover</a>.\n", "\nHenry Ford, founder of the Ford Motor Company, developed the assembly line technique of mass production. In 1913, he pioneered the moving assembly line for the production of the Ford Model T automobile. The reduced manufacturing time for parts\u00a0allowed the company to apply the same method to chassis assembly and drastically reduced the time it took to build the Model T automobile.\n", "\nFord continued to refine the process, even hiring someone who studied the way people moved most efficiently. Between 1908 and 1927, Ford built 15 million Model T cars. As a result of Ford's mass production, cars became something that the general public could afford, rather than a luxury item that only a limited number of people had access to.\n", "\nHenry Ford\u2019s innovative production method is still used today by companies seeking rapid, standardized product creation.\n"]}
