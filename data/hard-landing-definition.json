The term \"hard landing\" comes from aviation, where it refers to the kind of high-speed landing that \u2013 while not an actual crash \u2013 is a source of stress as well as potential damage and injury. The metaphor is used for high-flying economies that run into a sudden, sharp check on their growth, such as a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monetarypolicy.asp\">monetary policy</a> intervention meant to curb inflation. Economies that experience a hard landing often slip into a stagnant period or even <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/recession.asp\">recession</a>.\n", "\nA hard landing is often seen as a result tightening economic policies meant to cool down an economy, but no central bank or government sets out to orchestrate a hard landing for their people. Most officials want to see a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/softlanding.asp\">soft landing</a>, where the overheating economy is slowly cooled off without sacrificing jobs or unnecessarily inflicting economic pain on people and corporations carrying debt. Unfortunately, the more heated an economy becomes through <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economic-stimulus.asp\">stimulus</a> or other economic interference, the more vulnerable it becomes to a hard landing due to even minor checks on growth.\n", "\nThe Federal Reserve, for example, has hiked interest rates at several points in its history at a pace that the market found unpalatable, leading the economy to slow and/or enter a period of recession. Most recently, there was a hard landing in 2007 resulting from the Fed tightening monetary policy to cool the residential real estate market. The fallout was spectacular, with a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/great-recession.asp\">Great Recession</a> rather than just a recession, but it is difficult to imagine how a soft landing could take place when the speculative bubble had grown so large.\n", "\nThe term hard landing has often been applied to China, which has enjoyed decades of preternaturally high <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gdp.asp\">gross domestic product (GDP)</a> growth rates that \u2013 to some observers \u2013 have set it up for a hard landing. High levels of debt, particularly at the local government level, are often pointed to as a potential catalyst for a downturn, as are high property prices in many Chinese cities.\n", "\nIn late 2015, following a rapid <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/trading/chinese-devaluation-yuan/\">devaluation</a> of the yuan and softening trade volumes, many observers feared a Chinese hard landing: Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale put the odds of at 30%. However, trade volumes recovered and currency markets stabilized. In 2019, the talk of a Chinese hard landing resurfaced with the crack down on <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shadow-banking-system.asp\">shadow finance</a> and speculation on what the loss of that credit source will do to Chinese businesses, growth and jobs. Of course, it is worth noting that China has yet to experience a hard landing, while all the western powers predicting it on their behalf have been through a few.\n"]}
