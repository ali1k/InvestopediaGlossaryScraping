A log-normal distribution can be translated to a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/102014/lognormal-and-normal-distribution.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">normal distribution</a> and vice versa using associated logarithmic calculations.\n", "\nA normal distributions is a probability distribution of outcomes that is symmetrical or forms a bell curve. In a normal distribution 68% of the results fall within one standard deviation and 95% fall within two standard deviations.\n", "\nWhile most people are familiar with a normal distribution, they may not be as familiar with log-normal distribution. A normal distribution can be converted to a log-normal distribution using logarithmic mathematics. That is primarily the basis as log-normal distributions can only come from a normally distributed set of random variables.\n", "\nThere can be a few reasons for using log-normal distributions in conjunction with normal distributions. In general most log-normal distributions are the result of taking the natural log where the base is equal to e=2.718. However, the log-normal distribution can be scaled using a different base which affects the shape of the lognormal distribution.\n", "\nOverall the log-normal distribution plots the log of random variables from a normal distribution curve. In general, the log is known as the exponent to which a base number must be raised in order to produce the random variable (x) that is found along a normally distributed curve.\n", "\nFor more, see also Investopedia's entry,\u00a0<em>Lognormal and\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/normaldistribution.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Normal Distribution</a></em>\n", "\nNormal distributions may present a few problems that log-normal distributions can solve. Mainly, normal distributions can allow for negative random variables while log-normal distributions include all positive variables.\n", "\nOne of the most common applications where log-normal distributions are used in finance is in the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://finance.zacks.com/stock-prices-considered-lognormal-10606.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">analysis of stock prices</a>. The potential returns of a stock can be graphed in a normal distribution. The prices of the stock however can be graphed in a log-normal distribution. The log-normal distribution curve can therefore be used to help better identify the compound return that the stock can expect to achieve over a period of time.\n", "\nNote that log-normal distributions are positively\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/skewness.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">skewed</a>\u00a0with long right tails due to low mean values and high variances in the random variables.\n", "\n<strong>Lognormal Distribution in Excel</strong>\n", "\nLognormal distribution can be done <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://support.office.com/en-us/article/lognorm-dist-function-eb60d00b-48a9-4217-be2b-6074aee6b070\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">in Excel</a>.
