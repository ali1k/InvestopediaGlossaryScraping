Specifically it looks to see what proportion of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebitda.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization</a> (EBITDA), can be used for this purpose.\n", "\nThe EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio is also known simply as as EBITDA coverage. The main difference between EBITDA coverage and the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestcoverageratio.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">interest coverage ratio</a>, is that the latter uses <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebit.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">earnings before income and taxes</a> (EBIT), rather than the more encompassing EBITDA.\n", "\nThe EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio was first widely used by <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leveragedbuyout.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">leveraged buyout</a> bankers, who would use it as a first screen to determine whether a newly restructured company would be able to service its <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shorttermdebt.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">short-term debt</a> obligations. A ratio greater than 1 indicates that the company has more than enough interest coverage to pay off its interest expenses.\n", "\nWhile the ratio is a very easy way to assess whether a company can cover its interest-related expenses, the applications of this ratio are also limited by the relevance of using EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) as a proxy for various financial figures. For example, suppose that a company has an EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio of 1.25; this may not mean that it would be able to cover its interest payments since the company might need to spend a large portion of its profits on replacing old equipment. Because EBITDA does not account for depreciation-related expenses, a ratio of 1.25 might not be a definitive indicator of financial durability.\n", "\nThere are two formulas used for the EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio that differ slightly. Analysts may differ in opinion on which one is more applicable to use depending on the company being analyzed. They are as follows:\n", "\nand\n", "\nAs an example, consider the following. A company reports sales revenue of $1,000,000. Salary expenses are reported as $250,000, while utilities are reported as $20,000. Lease payments are $100,000. The company also reports <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/depreciation.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">depreciation</a> of $50,000 and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestexpense.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">interest expenses</a> of $120,000. To calculate the EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio, first an analyst needs to calculate the EBITDA. EBITDA is calculated by taking the company's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebit.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">EBIT</a> (earnings before interest and tax) and adding back the depreciation and amortization amounts.\n", "\nIn the above example, the company's EBIT and EBITDA are calculated as:\n", "\nNext, using the formula for EBITDA-to-interest coverage that includes the lease payments term, the company's EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio is:\n"]}
