If a borrower can't make a sizable downpayment and as a result, the loan value approaches the value of the appraised value of the property, it'll be considered a high ratio loan. In other words, as the loan value gets closer to 100% of the property value, lenders might consider the loan too risky and deny the application.\n", "\nThe lender is at risk of borrower default particularly if the LTV is too high. The bank might not be able to sell the property to cover the amount of the loan given to the defaulted borrower. Such a scenario can easily occur in an economic downturn when housing properties typically decrease in value. If the loan given to the borrower exceeds the value of the property, the loan is said to be underwater. If the borrower defaults on the mortgage, the bank will lose money when they go to sell the property for a lower value than the outstanding mortgage balance. Banks monitor LTV to prevent such a loss.\n", "\nAs a result, most high ratio home loans require some form of insurance coverage in order to protect the lender. The insurance is called <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/mortgage-guide/mortgage-insurance/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">private mortgage insurance (PMI)</a>, which the borrower would need to purchases separately to help protect the lender.\n", "\nUp until the 1920s, people bought homes not by going to a bank, but by saving their own money until they had enough for at least a piece of land or land with a house on it. Then, along came the building and loan company, which would lend people the money to buy a house then\u00a0have them pay it back in installments over many years. Even then, loans typically were for half the value of the house or less.\u00a0\n", "\nBy the end of the 1920s, banks were making high-ratio loans for up to 80% of the value of the house. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortgage-insurance.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Private mortgage insurance</a> came into being to protect the banks, but all that went by the wayside in the 1930s when jobless people stopped making payments and the banks and the PMI companies went under as well.\n", "\nCongress enacted the\u00a0Home Owners\u2019 Loan Corp., which began guaranteeing mortgages and ratios sunk to 15%.

The sharp increase in high-risk mortgages that went into default beginning in 2007 contributed to the most severe\u00a0recession\u00a0in decades. The housing boom of the mid-2000s\u2014combined with low interest rates at the time\u2014prompted many lenders to offer home loans to individuals with poor credit. After the real estate bubble burst, many borrowers were unable to make payments on their\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/subprime_mortgage.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">subprime mortgages</a>.\n", "\nThe <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www.hud.gov/federal_housing_administration\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Federal Housing Administration</a> offers programs through which borrowers can get <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/082616/whats-difference-between-fha-and-conventional-loans.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FHA loans</a> with an LTV ratio of up to 96.5%. In other words, the program requires a 3.5% downpayment. However, the program requires a minimum credit score to get approved for a high ratio loan. There are other offers whereby a lower credit score is allowed with a 10% downpayment.\n", "\nAlso, the FHA loans require\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/insurance/qualified-insurance-premium/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mortgage insurance premium (MIP)</a>.

The result is a loan-to-value ratio of 90% or (90,000 / 100,000), which would be considered a high ratio loan.\n", "\nA <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/homeequityloan.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">home-equity loan</a> is a home-equity installment loan or a\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/secondmortgage.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">second mortgage</a> that allows homeowners to borrow against their equity in their residence.

In other words, a home equity loan allows homeowners to borrow based on the equity in the house. A high-ratio loan, on the other hand, can have a loan value that approaches 100% of the value of the property.\n", "\nHigh-ratio loans can have higher interest rates, especially if borrowers have a low credit score. Your credit score is a numeric value that represents your ability to pay back debt and shows lenders how much of a risk you are of defaulting. If your score is low, your interest rate will likely be higher.\n"]}
