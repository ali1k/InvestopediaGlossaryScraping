The gross rate of return is often quoted as the rate of return on an investment in fund marketing materials. Returns for more than a year are often annualized, which provides the geometric average return of an investment for each year over a given time period.\n", "\nIn investment management, the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www.cfainstitute.org/ethics/codes/gipsstandards/Pages/index.aspx\">CFA Institute's Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS)</a> govern the calculation and reporting of returns. Investors can rely on the GIPS return standards for comparing investment-return characteristics across the industry.\n", "\nInvestors often use return calculations when considering a new investment or assessing the performance of an investment. Net return is typically not as easily identified as a gross return. For this reason, investors often turn to the expense ratio in order to determine how the expenses affect the return of the fund.\u00a0\n", "\nThe <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expenseratio.asp\">expense ratio</a> is a mutual fund characteristic that represents the percentage of fund assets paid for expenses. It is often used in conjunction with a fund\u2019s total return and benchmark return to provide a comparison of the fund\u2019s performance.\n", "\nAs an example, a fact sheet provided by one of the market\u2019s top large-cap funds, the Quanti\u00adfied STF Fund (MUTF: QSTFX), provides an example of how returns and expenses are expressed. The <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"http://www.quantifiedfunds.com/stf-fund\" rel=\"nofollow\">Quantified STF Fund</a> reports a gross rate of return. It also provides a breakdown of the fund\u2019s expenses and has an expense ratio of 1.71%.\n", "\nFor net return, fees and commissions are deducted, as well as the effects of taxes and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp\">inflation</a>. A currency loses <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/purchasingpower.asp\">purchasing power</a> due to inflation, which also affects the return on an investment. Therefore, inflation should be included in the calculation of real return. If, for example, annual inflation is 2% and the nominal return on an investment is 1%, the investor will have made a negative real return in the course of one year.\n", "\nThus, the gross rate of return can be substantially different than the net rate of return, which deducts fees and expenses. For example, the gross return realized on a mutual fund that charges a 5.75% <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/salescharge.asp\">sales charge</a> will be very different than the net return, which will be realized after the charge has been deducted.\n"]}
