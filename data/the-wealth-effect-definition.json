The concept hones in on how the feelings of security, referred to as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/fundamental/103002.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">consumer confidence</a>, are strengthened by sizable increases in the value of investment portfolios. Extra confidence contributes to higher levels of spending and lower levels of saving.\n", "\nThis theory can also be applied to businesses. Companies tend to increase their hiring levels and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalexpenditure.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">capital expenditures</a> (CapEx) in response to rising asset values, in a similar fashion to that observed on the consumer side.\n", "\nWhat this means is <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economicgrowth.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">economic growth</a> should strengthen during bull markets\u2014and erode in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/bear-market/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bear markets</a>.\n", "\nAt first glance, the notion that the wealth effect spurs personal consumption makes sense. It is reasonable to assume that anyone sitting on huge gains from a house or stock portfolio would be more inclined to splash out on an expensive holiday, new car, or other <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/discretionary-expense.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">discretionary items</a>.\n", "\nNevertheless, critics claim that increasing asset wealth should have a much smaller impact on consumer spending than other factors, such as tax, household expenses, and employment trends. Why? Because a gain in the value of an investor\u2019s portfolio does not actually equate to higher <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/disposableincome.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">disposable income</a>.\n", "\nInitially, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockmarket.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">stock market</a> gains must be considered <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unrealizedgain.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">unrealized</a>. An unrealized gain is a profit that exists on paper, but that has yet to be sold in return for cash. The same applies to rocketing property prices.\n", "\nProponents of the wealth effect can point to several occasions when<strong> </strong>significant <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">interest rate</a> and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxrate.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tax</a> increases during bull markets failed to put the brakes on consumer spending.

Even though\u00a0disposable income\u00a0declined because of the additional tax burden, wealth continued to grow as the stock market persistently climbed higher.\n", "\nStill, there is considerable debate among market pundits about whether or not the wealth effect truly exists, especially within the context of the stock market. Some believe the effect has more to do with <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/correlation.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">correlation</a> and not causation, proposing that increased spending leads to asset appreciation, not the other way around.\n", "\nWhile it has yet to be definitively connected, there is more robust evidence linking increased spending to higher home values.\n", "\nEconomic luminaries Karl Case and Robert Shiller, the developers of\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sandp_case_shiller_index.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the Case-Shiller home price indices</a>, together with John Quigley set out to research the wealth effect theory by compiling data from 1982 to 1999.
