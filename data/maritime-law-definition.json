International rules, governing the use of the oceans and seas, are known as the Law of the Sea.\n", "\nIn most developed nations, maritime law follows a separate code and is an independent jurisdiction from national laws. The <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/united-nations-un.asp\">United Nations</a> (UN), through the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/international-maritime-organization.asp\">International Maritime Organization (IMO)</a>, has issued numerous conventions that can be enforced by the navies and coast guards of countries that have signed the treaty outlining these rules. Maritime law governs many of the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurance_claim.asp\">insurance claims</a> relating to ships and cargo; civil matters between shipowners, seamen, and passengers; and piracy.\n", "\nAdditionally, maritime law regulates registration, license, and inspection procedures for ships and shipping contracts; maritime insurance; and the carriage of goods and passengers.\n", "\nThe IMO (established in 1948 as the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organization, and\u00a0coming into force in 1958) is responsible for ensuring that existing international maritime conventions are kept up to date, as well as developing new agreements as and when the need arises.\u00a0\n", "\nToday, there are dozens of conventions regulating all aspects of maritime commerce and transport. The IMO names three\u00a0conventions\u00a0as its core:\n", "\nOn its website, the IMO has a complete list of existing conventions, historical amendments, and explanatory notes.\n", "\nThe governments of the 174 IMO member states are responsible for the implementation of IMO conventions for ships registered in their nation.\u00a0Local governments enforce the provisions of IMO conventions as far as their ships are concerned and set the penalties for infringements. In some cases, ships must carry certificates onboard to show that they have been inspected and have met the required standards.\n", "\nThe country of registration determines\u00a0a ship's nationality. For most ships, the national\u00a0registry is\u00a0the country\u00a0where\u00a0the owners\u00a0live and operate\u00a0their business.\n", "\nShip owners will often register their ships in countries that allow foreign registration. Called \"flags of convenience,\" the foreign registration is useful for tax planning and to take advantage of lenient local laws. Two examples of \"flags of convenience\" countries are Panama and Bermuda.\n"]}
