A hard fork\u00a0requires all nodes or users to upgrade to the latest version of the protocol software.\n", "\nForks may be initiated by developers or members of a crypto community who grow dissatisfied with functionalities offered by existing blockchain implementations. They may also emerge as a way to crowdsource funding for new technology projects or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cryptocurrency.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cryptocurrency</a> offerings.\n", "\nA hard fork can be contrasted with a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/soft-fork.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">soft fork</a>.\n", "\nA hard fork is when nodes of the newest version of a blockchain no longer accept the older version(s) of the blockchain; which creates a\u00a0permanent divergence from the previous version of the blockchain.\n", "\nAdding a new rule to the code essentially creates a fork in the blockchain: one path\u00a0follows the new, upgraded blockchain, and the other\u00a0path\u00a0continues along the old path. Generally, after a short time, those on the old chain will realize that their version of the blockchain is outdated or irrelevant and quickly upgrade to the latest version.\n", "\nA fork in a blockchain can occur in <em>any </em>crypto-technology platform\u2014not only <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bitcoin.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bitcoin</a>. That is because blockchains and cryptocurrency work in basically the same way no matter which crypto platform they're on. You may think of the blocks in blockchains as cryptographic keys that move memory. Because the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mining.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">miners</a> in a blockchain set the rules that move the memory in the network, these miners understand the new rules.\n", "\nHowever, <em>all </em>of the miners need to agree about the new rules and about what comprises a valid block in the chain. So when you want to change those rules you need to \"fork it\"\u2014like a fork in a road\u2014to indicate that there's been a change in or a diversion to the protocol. The developers can then update all of the software to reflect the new rules.\n", "\nIt is through this forking process that various digital currencies with names similar to bitcoin have come to be:\u00a0bitcoin cash, bitcoin gold, and others. For the casual cryptocurrency investor, it can be difficult to tell the difference\u00a0between these cryptocurrencies and to map the various forks onto a timeline. To help sort this out, we have composed a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/tech/history-bitcoin-hard-forks/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">history of the most important bitcoin hard forks</a> of the past several years.\u00a0\n", "\nThere are a number of reasons why developers may implement a hard fork, such as correcting important security risks found in older versions of the software, to add new functionality, or to reverse transactions\u2014such as when the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ethereum.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ethereum</a> blockchain created a hard fork to reverse the hack on the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/tech/what-dao/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Decentralized Autonomous Organization</a> (DAO).\n", "\nAfter the hack, the Ethereum\u00a0community almost unanimously voted in favor of a hard fork to roll back transactions\u00a0that siphoned off tens of millions of dollars worth of digital currency by an anonymous hacker. The hard fork also helped DAO token holders get their <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ether-cryptocurrency.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ether</a> (ETH) funds returned.\n", "\nThe proposal for a hard fork did not exactly unwind the network\u2019s transaction history. Rather, it relocated the funds tied to the DAO to a newly created smart contract with the single purpose of letting the original owners withdraw their funds.\u00a0\n", "\nDAO token holders could withdraw ETH at a rate of approximately 1 ETH to 100 DAO. The extra balance of tokens and any ether that remained as a result of the hard fork was withdrawn and distributed by the DAO curators to provide \"failsafe protection\" for the organization.\n", "\nHard forks and\u00a0soft forks are essentially the same in the sense that when a cryptocurrency platform's existing code is changed, an old version remains on the network while the new version is created.\n", "\nWith a soft fork, only one blockchain\u00a0will remain valid as users adopt the update. Whereas with a hard fork, both the old and new blockchains exist side by side, which means that the software must be updated to work by the new rules. Both forks create a split, but a hard fork creates two blockchains and a soft fork is meant to result in one.\u00a0\n", "\nConsidering the differences in security between hard and soft forks, almost all users and developers call for a hard fork, even when a soft fork seems like it could do the job. Overhauling the blocks in a blockchain requires a tremendous amount of computing power, but the privacy gained from a hard fork makes more sense than using a soft fork.\n"]}
