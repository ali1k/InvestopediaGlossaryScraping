UCITS funds can be registered in Europe and sold to investors worldwide using unified regulatory and investor protection requirements. UCITS fund providers who meet the standards are exempt from national regulation in individual European countries.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"8\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nIn everyday usage, a UCITS is a mutual fund based in the European Union. UCITS funds are perceived as safe and well-regulated investments and are popular in Europe, South America, and Asia among investors who prefer not to invest in a single <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/plc.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">public limited company</a> but rather among diversified unit trusts spread out within the European Union.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"7\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nThe first UCITS Directive was adopted on Dec. 20, 1985, with a stated aim of facilitating cross-border offerings of investment funds to retail investors.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff In the early 1990s, proposals for modifications to the directive were made but never fully adopted. As such, there is no UCITS II.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff However, in 2002, following discussions among member countries, two new directives were adopted. Directives 2001/107/EC and 2001/108/EC, together known as UCITS III, broadened the investment spectrum of UCITS funds and relaxed some restrictions for index funds.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nUCITS IV, or Directive 2009/65/EC, brought about further technical changes and was adopted in July 2011.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff Finally, UCITS V, or Directive 2014/91/EU, which went into effect in March 2016, aligns fund depositories' duties and responsibilities and fund managers' remuneration requirements with those of the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/alternative-investment-fund-managers-directive-aifmd.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive</a> (AIFMD).<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"8\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nBecause they are seen as very safe and well-regulated, UCITS funds are very popular investments. According to the European Commission, they account for around 75% of all collective investments by small investors in Europe.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"6\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff Many mutual fund providers use an expression such as \"UCITS-compliant\" as part of their marketing strategy. While the funds are regulated in Europe, buyers from all over the world can invest in UCITS funds.\n"]}
