Operating leases are considered a form of off-balance-sheet financing\u2014meaning a leased asset and associated liabilities (i.e. future rent payments) are not included on a company's balance sheet. Historically, operating leases have enabled American firms to keep billions of dollars of assets and liabilities from being recorded on their balance sheets, thereby keeping their <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtequityratio.asp\">debt-to-equity ratios</a> low.\n", "\nTo be classified as an operating lease, the lease must meet certain requirements under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) that exempt it from being recorded as a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitallease.asp\">capital\u00a0lease</a>. Companies must test for four criteria\u2014\u201cbright line\u201d tests\u2014that determine whether rental contracts must be booked as operating or capital\u00a0leases. Current GAAP rules require companies to treat leases as capital leases if:\n", "\nIf none of these conditions are met, then the lease must be classified as an operating lease. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) may reclassify an operating lease as a capital lease to reject the lease payments as a deduction, thus increasing the company's taxable income and tax liability.\n", "\nTypically, assets that are rented under operating leases include real estate, aircraft, and equipment with long, useful life spans\u2014such as vehicles, office equipment, and industry-specific machinery.\n", "\nEffective Dec. 15, 2018, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www.fasb.org/jsp/FASB/Document_C/DocumentPage?cid=1176167901010&amp;acceptedDisclaimer=true\">FASB revised its rules</a> governing lease accounting.

Other changes include the following:\n", "\nU.S. GAAP accounting treatments for operating and capital leases are different and can have a significant impact on businesses' taxes. An operating lease is treated like renting\u2014lease payments are considered as operating expenses. Assets being leased are not recorded on the company's balance sheet; they are expensed on the\u00a0income statement. So, they affect both operating and net income. Other characteristics include:\n", "\nIn contrast, a capital lease is more like a long-term loan, or ownership. The asset is treated as being owned by the lessee and is recorded on the balance sheet.
