Simply put, they\u00a0increase\u00a0the price of\u00a0goods and services purchased from another country, making them less attractive\u00a0to domestic consumers.\n", "\nA key point to understand is that the tariff imposed affects the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/export.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">exporting</a> country indirectly as the domestic consumer might shy away from their product due to the increase in price. If the domestic consumer still chooses the imported product then the tariff has essentially raised the cost for the domestic consumer.\n", "\nThere are two types of tariffs:\n", "\nGovernments may impose tariffs to raise revenue or to protect domestic industries\u2014especially nascent ones\u2014from foreign competition. By making foreign-produced goods more expensive, tariffs can make domestically produced alternatives seem more attractive.\n", "\nGovernments that use tariffs to benefit particular industries often do so to protect companies and jobs. Tariffs can also be used as an extension of foreign policy as their imposition on a trading partner's main exports may be used to exert economic leverage.\n", "\nTariffs can have unintended side effects:\n", "\nIn pre-modern Europe, a nation's wealth was believed to consist of fixed, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tangibleasset.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tangible assets</a>, such as gold, silver, land, and other physical resources. Trade was seen as a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/z/zero-sumgame.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">zero-sum game</a> that resulted in either a clear net loss or a clear net gain of wealth. If a country imported more than it exported, a resource, mainly gold, would flow abroad thereby draining its wealth. Cross-border trade\u00a0was viewed with suspicion, and countries much preferred to acquire colonies with which they could establish exclusive trading relationships, rather than trading with each other.\u00a0\n", "\nThis system, known as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mercantilism.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mercantilism</a>, relied heavily on tariffs and even outright bans on trade. The colonizing country, which saw itself as competing with other colonizers, would import raw materials from its colonies, which were generally barred from selling their raw materials\u00a0elsewhere. The colonizing country would convert the materials into manufactured wares, which it would sell back to the colonies. High tariffs and other barriers were put in place to make sure that colonies purchased manufactured goods only from their colonizers.\u00a0\n", "\nThe Scottish economist <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/updates/adam-smith-economics/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Adam Smith</a> was one of the first to question the wisdom of this arrangement. His <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/updates/adam-smith-wealth-of-nations/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Wealth of Nations</em></a> was published in 1776, the same year that Britain's American colonies declared independence in response to high taxes and restrictive trade arrangements.\n", "\nLater writers, such as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/david-ricardo.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">David Ricardo</a>, further developed Smith's ideas, leading to the theory of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/comparativeadvantage.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">comparative advantage</a>. It maintains that if one country is better at producing a certain product, while another country is better at producing another, each should devote its resources to the activity at which it excels.\u00a0The countries should then trade with one another, rather than erecting barriers that force them to divert resources toward activities they do not perform well. Tariffs, according to this theory, are a drag on economic growth, even if they can be deployed to benefit certain narrow sectors under some circumstances.\n", "\nRelatively free trade enjoyed a heyday in the late 19th and early 20th centuries when the idea took hold that international commerce had made\u00a0large-scale wars between nations so expensive and counterproductive that they were obsolete. World War I proved that idea wrong, and nationalist approaches to trade, including high tariffs, dominated until the end of World War II.\n", "\nFrom that point on, free trade enjoyed a 50-year resurgence, culminating in the creation in 1995 of the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wto.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">World Trade Organization</a> (WTO), which\u00a0acts\u00a0as an international forum for settling disputes and laying down ground rules.\u00a0Free trade agreements, such as the North American\u00a0Free Trade Agreement\u00a0(NAFTA)\u2014now known as the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/usmca-4582387\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement</a> (USMCA)\u2014and the European Union (EU), also proliferated.\n", "\nSkepticism of this model\u2014sometimes labeled <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/neoliberalism.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">neoliberalism</a> by critics, who tie it to 19th-century liberal arguments in favor\u00a0of free trade\u2014grew, however, and Britain in 2016 voted to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brexit.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">leave</a> the European Union. That same year Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election on a platform that included a call for tariffs on Chinese and Mexican imports, which he implemented when he took office.\n", "\nCritics of tariff-free multilateral trade deals, who come from both ends of the political spectrum, argue that they erode national sovereignty and encourage a race to the bottom in terms of wages, worker protections, and product quality and standards. The defenders of such deals, meanwhile, counter that tariffs lead to trade wars, hurt consumers, hamper innovation, and encourage xenophobia.\n"]}
