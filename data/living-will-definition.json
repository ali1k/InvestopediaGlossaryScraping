In the absence of a living will, decisions about medical care become the responsibility of the spouse, family members, or other <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/third-party.asp\">third parties</a>. These individuals may be unaware of the patient\u2019s desires, or they may not wish to follow the patient\u2019s unwritten, verbal directives.\n", "\nLiving wills and advance directives come into play only when one faces a life-threatening condition and is unable to communicate their desires for treatment. Doctors don\u2019t consult the wills for standard medical care that doesn\u2019t involve life-threatening situations. Every state provides for the drafting of a living will, although some states call the document a medical directive or a health-care <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proxy.asp\">proxy</a>. Some states let you prepare a detailed, customized living will, while others require you to fill out a standardized form.\n", "\nA living will addresses many of the medical procedures common in life-threatening situations, such as resuscitation via electric shock, ventilation, and dialysis. One can choose to allow some of these procedures or none of them. One can also indicate whether\u00a0they wish to donate organs and tissues after death. Even if the patient refuses life-sustaining care, they can express the\u00a0desire to receive pain medication throughout their final hours.\n", "\nIn most states, one can extend the living will to cover situations where there is no brain activity or where doctors expect them to remain unconscious for the rest of their\u00a0life, even if a terminal illness or life-threatening injury isn\u2019t present. Because these situations can occur to any person at any age, it\u2019s a good idea for all adults to have a living will.\n", "\nIn addition to the living will, one can select a health-care proxy who is allowed to make decisions for if they are incapable of making those choices. Some states call this individual a health-care <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/powerofattorney.asp\">power of attorney</a>. Living wills cover many medical decisions, but a health-care proxy can consult with the doctor on other issues that may arise. When facing the loss of a loved one, families often disagree over treatment, so having a health-care proxy reduces confusion over one's final wishes. One should discuss wishes with the proxy before naming this person\u00a0and be sure the proxy is willing to follow through with their desires.\n"]}
