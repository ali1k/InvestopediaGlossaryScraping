Some benefits are awarded to compensate employees for costs related to their work while others are geared to general job satisfaction.\n", "\nIn any case, employers use fringe benefits to help\u00a0them recruit, motivate, and keep high-quality people.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/011915/what-are-some-examples-common-fringe-benefits.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Common fringe benefits are basic items often included in hiring packages</a>.

Alphabet, the parent company of Google, is known for its benefits that include free commuter bus service and a free gourmet cafeteria.

Those rules are complex too.\n", "\nFor example, working condition benefits are taxable to the extent that they are for personal use. If an employee is given a laptop, the taxable income would be the percentage of the laptop's fair market value that is devoted to personal use. If 80% of its use is personal, the taxable income is 80% of the value of the computer.\n", "\nIn general, fringe benefits are valued at fair market value. This is the amount the employee would pay for the same benefit at retail.\n", "\nBy default, fringe benefits are taxable unless they are specifically exempted.
