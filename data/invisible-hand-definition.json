Through individual self-interest and freedom of production as well as consumption, the best interest of society, as a whole, are fulfilled. The constant interplay of individual pressures on market supply and demand causes the natural movement of prices and the flow of trade.\n", "\nThe invisible hand is part of <em>laissez-faire, </em>meaning \"let do/let go,\"<em> </em>approach to the market. In other words, the approach holds that the market will find its equilibrium without government or other interventions forcing it into unnatural patterns.\n", "\nScottish Enlightenment thinker <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/updates/adam-smith-economics/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Adam Smith</a> introduced the concept in several of his writings, but it found this economic interpretation in his book <em>An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations</em> published in 1776 and in <em>The Theory of Moral Sentiments</em> published in 1759. The term found use in an economic sense during the 1900s.\n", "\nThe\u00a0invisible hand metaphor distills\u00a0two critical ideas.\u00a0First, voluntary trades in a free market produce unintentional and widespread benefits. Second, these benefits are greater than those of a regulated, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/centrally-planned-economy.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">planned economy</a>.\n", "\nEach free exchange creates signals about which goods and services are valuable and how difficult they are to bring to market. These signals, captured in the price system, spontaneously direct competing <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumer-theory.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">consumers</a>, producers, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/distribution-channel.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">distributors</a>, and intermediaries\u2014each pursuing their individual plans\u2014 to fulfill the needs and desires of others.\n", "\nBusiness productivity and profitability are improved when profits and losses accurately reflect what investors and consumers want. This concept is well-demonstrated through a famous example in Richard Cantillon\u2019s <em>An Essay on Economic Theory</em> (1755), the book from which Smith developed his invisible hand concept.\n", "\nCantillon described an isolated estate that divided into competing leased farms. Independent entrepreneurs ran each farm to maximize their production and returns. The successful farmers introduced better equipment and techniques\u00a0and brought to market only those goods for which consumers were willing to pay. He showed that returns were far higher when competing self-interests ran the estate rather than the previous landlord's command economy.\n", "\n<em>An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations </em>was published during the first Industrial Revolution and the same year as the American Declaration of Independence. Smith\u2019s invisible hand became one of the primary justifications for an economic system of free market <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalism.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">capitalism</a>.\n", "\nAs a result, the business climate of the United States developed with a general understanding that voluntary private markets are more productive than government-run economies. Even government rules sometimes try to incorporate the invisible hand. Former Fed Chairman <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/benbernanke.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ben Bernanke</a> explained the \"market-based approach is regulation by the invisible hand\" which \"aims to align the incentives of market participants with the objectives of the regulator.\"<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n"]}
