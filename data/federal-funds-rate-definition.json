By law, banks must maintain a reserve equal to a certain percentage of their deposits in an account at a Federal Reserve bank. The amount of money a bank must keep in its Fed account is known as a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/requiredreserves.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reserve requirement</a> and is based on a percentage of the bank's total deposits.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nThey are required to maintain non-interest-bearing accounts at <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalreservesystem.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Federal Reserve</a> banks to ensure that they will have enough money to cover depositors' withdrawals and other obligations.

By increasing the amount of money in the system it can cause interest rates to fall. Conversely, by decreasing the money supply it can make interest rates rise.\n", "\nThe target for the federal funds rate has varied widely over the years in response to the prevailing economic conditions. It was set as high as 20% in the early 1980s in response to inflation.

The stock market typically reacts very strongly to changes in the target rate. For example, even a small decline in the rate can prompt the market to leap higher as the borrowing costs for companies gets lower.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"11\"></span> Many stock analysts pay particular attention to statements by members of the FOMC to try to get a sense of where the target rate might be headed.\n", "\nThe federal funds rate is the interest rate that banks charge each other to borrow or lend excess reserves overnight. Law requires that banks must have a minimum reserve level in proportion to their deposits. This reserve requirement is held at a Federal Reserve Bank. When a bank has excess reserve requirements, it may lend these funds overnight to other banks that have realized a reserve deficit.\n", "\nIn response to COVID-19, the Federal Reserve brought the federal funds rate down to 0.00%- 0.25% in March 2020. It is customary for the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets 8 times annually to determine the federal funds rate. These rates are influenced by economic indicators, such as the core inflation rate and the durable goods orders report, which provide signals about the economic health of the country.\n", "\nBoth the federal funds rate and interest rates are some of the most important financial indicators in the United States. The chief distinction is that the federal funds rate sets the range that banks will lend or borrow to each other overnight. Because this impacts borrowing costs and financial conditions, stock markets are typically sensitive to changes in these rates. The federal funds rate also indirectly affects short-term interest rates. Conversely, interest rates, which are set by the Federal Reserve, determine the rate that it costs for banks to borrow.\n"]}
