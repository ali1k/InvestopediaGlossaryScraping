This means that there is no actual delivery of the two currencies involved in the swap, unlike a typical currency swap where there is physical exchange of currency flows. Instead, periodic settlement of a\u00a0NDS is done on a cash basis, generally in U.S. dollars.\n", "\nThe settlement value is based on the difference between the exchange rate specified in the swap contract and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/spot-rate/\">the spot rate</a>, with one party paying the other the difference. A non-deliverable swap can be viewed as a series of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/ndf.asp\">non-deliverable forwards</a> bundled together.\n", "\nNon-deliverable swaps are used by multi-national corporations\u00a0to mitigate the risk that they may not be allowed to repatriate profits because of currency controls. They also use NDSs to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedge.asp\">hedge</a> the risk of abrupt devaluation or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/depreciation.asp\">depreciation</a> in a restricted currency with little <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp\">liquidity</a>, and to avoid the prohibitive cost of exchanging currencies in the local market. Financial institutions in nations with exchange restrictions use NDSs to hedge their foreign currency loan exposure.\n", "\nThe key variables in a\u00a0NDS are:\n", "\nConsider a financial institution \u2013 let\u2019s call it LendEx \u2013 based in Argentina, that has taken a five-year US$10 million loan from a U.S. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lender.asp\">lender</a> at a fixed interest rate of 4% per annum payable semi-annually. LendEx has converted the U.S. dollar into Argentine pesos at the current exchange rate of 5.4, for lending to local businesses. However, it is concerned about the future depreciation of the peso, which will make it more expensive to make the interest payments and principal repayment in U.S. dollars. It therefore enters into a currency swap with an overseas <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/counterparty.asp\">counterparty</a> on the following terms:\n", "\nThe methodology for determining the NDS follows the following equation:\n", "\nHere\u2019s how the NDS works out in this example. On the first fixing date \u2013 which is two days before the first interest payment / settlement date \u2013 assume the spot exchange rate is 5.7 pesos to the U.S. dollar. Since LendEx has contracted to buy dollars at a rate of 6, it would have to pay the difference between this contract rate and the spot rate times the notional interest amount to the counterparty. This net settlement amount would be in U.S. dollars and works out to -$20,000 [i.e. (5.7 - 6.0) x 400,000 = -120,000 / 6 = -$20,000].\n", "\nOn the second fixing date, assume the spot exchange rate is 6.5 to the U.S. dollar. In this case, because the spot exchange rate is worse than the contracted rate, LendEx will receive a net payment of $33,333 [calculated as (6.5 \u2013 6.0) x 400,000 = 200,000 / 6 = $33,333].\n", "\nThis process continues until the final repayment date. A key point to note here is that because this is a non-deliverable swap, settlements between the counterparties are made in U.S. dollars, and not in Argentine pesos.\n"]}
