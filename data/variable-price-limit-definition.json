These limits are subject to change and, in fact, some commodities may lack variable price limits altogether. Before trading a particular commodity, traders should carefully review that contract\u2019s specifications to make sure they understand how the exchange would handle periods of heightened volatility.

As of March 2021, the price of its rough rice contracts was subject to a fixed limit price of $0.85, meaning that trading would be halted if the price of rough rice rose or fell by that amount or greater within any single trading day. At the same time, the variable price limit for rough rice was set to $1.30.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\"></span> This larger band is designed to give traders ample move to enter or exit their positions the following day, so that the market price of rough rice could regain its equilibrium reasonably quickly.\n"]}
