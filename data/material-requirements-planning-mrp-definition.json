Companies use material requirements-planning\u00a0systems to estimate quantities of raw materials and schedule their <a class=\"CMY_Link CMY_Valid\" data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/delivery.asp\">deliveries</a>.\n", "\nMRP is designed to answer three questions:\u00a0<em>What</em>\u00a0is needed?\u00a0<em>How much</em>\u00a0is needed? <em>When</em>\u00a0is it needed?\" MRP works backward from a production plan for finished goods, which is converted into a list of requirements for the subassemblies, component parts, and raw materials that are needed to produce the final product within the established schedule.\n", "\nBy parsing raw data\u2014like bills of lading and shelf life of stored materials\u2014this technology provides meaningful information to managers about their need for labor and supplies, which can help companies improve their <a class=\"CMY_Link CMY_Valid\" data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/production_efficiency.asp\">production efficiency</a>.\n", "\nMaterial requirements planning\u00a0was the earliest of the integrated information technology (IT) systems that aimed to improve productivity for businesses by using computers and software technology. The first MRP systems of inventory management evolved in the 1940s and 1950s. They used mainframe computers to extrapolate information from a bill of materials for a specific finished product into a production and purchasing plan. Soon, MRP systems expanded to include information feedback loops so that production managers could change and update the system inputs as needed.\n", "\nThe next generation of MRP, manufacturing resources planning (MRP II), also incorporated marketing, finance, accounting, engineering, and human resources aspects into the planning process. A related concept that expands on MRP is <a class=\"CMY_Link CMY_Valid\" data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/erp.asp\">enterprise resources planning (ERP)</a>, which uses computer technology to link the various functional areas across an entire business enterprise. As data analysis and technology became more sophisticated, more comprehensive systems were developed to integrate MRP with other aspects of the manufacturing process.\n", "\nA critical input for\u00a0material requirements planning is a\u00a0<a class=\"CMY_Link CMY_Valid\" data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bill-of-materials.asp\">bill of materials (BOM)</a>\u2014an extensive list of raw materials, components, and assemblies required to construct, manufacture or repair a product or service. BOM\u00a0specifies the relationship between the\u00a0end product\u00a0(independent demand) and the components (dependent demand). Independent demand originates outside the plant or production system, and dependent demand refers to components.\n", "\nCompanies need to manage the\u00a0types and quantities of materials they purchase strategically; plan which products to manufacture and in what quantities; and ensure that they are able to meet current and future customer demand\u2014all\u00a0at the lowest possible cost. MRP helps companies\u00a0maintain low inventory levels. Making a bad decision in any area of the production cycle will cause the company to lose money.\u00a0By maintaining appropriate levels of inventory, manufacturers can better align their production with rising and falling demand.\n", "\nThe data that must be considered in an MRP scheme include:\n"]}
