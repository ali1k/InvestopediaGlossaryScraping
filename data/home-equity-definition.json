In other words, it is the real property\u2019s current market value\u00a0(less any liens that are attached to that property).\u00a0The amount of equity in a house\u2014or its value\u2014fluctuates\u00a0over time as more payments are made on the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortgage.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mortgage</a>\u00a0and market forces impact the\u00a0current value of the property.\n", "\nIf\u00a0a portion\u2014or all\u2014of a home, is purchased via a mortgage loan, the lending institution has an interest in the home until the loan obligation has been met. Home equity is\u00a0the portion\u00a0of\u00a0a home's current value that\u00a0the owner actually possesses at any given time.\n", "\nEquity in a house is initially acquired with the down payment you make during the initial purchase of the property. After that, more equity is achieved through your <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage-calculator-5084794\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mortgage payments</a>, since a contracted portion of that payment will be assigned to bring down the outstanding principal you still owe on the loan. You can also benefit from property value <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/appreciation.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">appreciation</a> because it will cause your equity value to increase.\n", "\nUnlike other investments, home equity cannot be quickly converted into cash. The equity calculation is based on a current market value <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/appraisal.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">appraisal</a> of your property. But that appraisal is no guarantee that the property would sell at that price.\u00a0\n", "\nHowever, an\u00a0owner can\u00a0leverage their home equity as collateral to secure either a home equity loan or a home equity line of credit (HELOC), or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/heloc/fixed-rate-option/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fixed-rate HELOC</a>, which is a kind of home equity loan and HELOC hybrid.\n", "\nA <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/homeequityloan.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">home equity loan</a>, sometimes referred to as a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/secondmortgage.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">second mortgage</a>, usually allows you to borrow\u00a0a lump sum against your current home equity for\u00a0a fixed rate over a fixed period of time. Many home equity loans are used to finance large expenditures, such as home repairs or college tuition.\n", "\nA <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/heloc/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">home equity line of credit (HELOC)</a> is a revolving line of credit usually with an adjustable interest rate, which allows you to borrow up to a certain amount over a period of time. HELOCs work in a manner similar to credit cards, where you can continuously borrow up to an approved limit while paying off the balance.\n", "\nIf a homeowner purchases a home for $100,000 with a 20% down payment (covering the remaining $80,000 with a mortgage), the owner has equity of $20,000 in the house. If the market value of the house remains constant over the next two years, and $5,000 of mortgage payments are applied to the principal, the owner would possess $25,000 in home equity at the end of the two year period.\n", "\nIf the market value of the home had increased by $100,000 over those two years, and that same $5,000 from mortgage payments were applied to the principal, the owner would then have a\u00a0home equity of $125,000.\n"]}
