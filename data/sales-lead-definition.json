Sales lead also refers to the data that identifies an entity as a potential buyer of a product or service. Businesses gain access to sales leads through advertising, trade shows, direct mailings, third parties, and other <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-theory/11/small-business-marketing-techniques.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">marketing efforts</a>. A sales lead is not really a sales \"prospect\" per se because a business would need to examine and qualify the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-advisors/041715/tips-breaking-ice-new-clients.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">potential new client</a> further to determine their intent and interest.\n", "\nThe sales process begins when a sales professional generates, qualifies, and places the sales lead data into a company's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pipeline.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sales pipeline</a>. Salesmen use the lead's contact information to send sales-pitch emails, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/direct-marketing.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">direct marketing</a> materials, and to make outbound sales calls.\n", "\nSeveral factors determine the quality of sales leads, such as whether the individual or business had the incentive to offer contact information, the accuracy of the data provided, and the validity of the sales lead.<strong> </strong>A sales lead's validity depends on whether the targeted person was aware of the sales opportunity when they responded.\n", "\nA report issued by Pew Research Center in April 2019 reveals that 90% of Americans regularly access the Internet.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\"></span> Because of this high level of access, the Internet provides ample opportunities to obtain sales leads.\u00a0However, acquiring sales\u00a0leads is a strategic process that requires skill and effort.\n", "\nBusinesses gain quality sales leads by using the Internet to inform themselves about consumers' unmet needs or problems and then offer solutions to them. For example, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technology_sector.asp\">technology sector</a> businesses may\u00a0provide e-books, hold webinars, and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/best-podcast-software-5086826\">broadcast podcasts</a> to enlighten consumers about using a product or software. Sales professionals could hold interactive online sessions and publish question-and-answer (Q&amp;A) materials for a similar purpose.\n", "\nThe Internet allows sales professionals to extend their reach globally. However, many Internet users are wary\u00a0of\u00a0providing\u00a0their\u00a0personal information online. Increasingly, consumers are demanding that the information they submit online is kept private.\n", "\nSocial media marketing is a type of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/digital-marketing.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">digital marketing</a> that uses popular social media platforms\u2014such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and Instagram\u2014to reach potential customers and get a company's message out. Effective <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/social-media-marketing-smm.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">social media marketing</a> campaigns look to engage social media users by encouraging comments, likes, and sharing of the company's messages and posts.\n", "\nSome social media campaigns are primarily to develop <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brandawareness.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">brand awareness</a> of a company's products or services. However, others develop sales leads by encouraging viewers to signup or provide an email address or other contact details in exchange for a free product or download.\n", "\nThe \"freebie\" that the company entices the viewer with is called a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lead-magnet.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lead magnet</a>. Lead magnets can take many forms. Popular ones include trial subscriptions, free consultations, special reports, tip sheets, white papers, and sample products. The marketer will then use the provided contact information to send the prospect additional messages that will entice the person to make an actual purchase.\n", "\nTraditional in-person <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/networking.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">networking</a> tends to be quite effective. Industry trade shows and networking events provide a wealth of sales leads for businesses, as does your local chamber of commerce. Disseminating information about products or services through advertising in local media also is useful.\n", "\nBy being <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/socialresponsibility.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">socially responsible</a>, businesses that give also receive. When a company or its employees donate time, effort, or supplies to local public service and nonprofit organizations, they not only reap the benefit of feeling good about helping others but also put their company's name in front of many viewers, which can generate numerous contacts including sales leads.\n"]}
