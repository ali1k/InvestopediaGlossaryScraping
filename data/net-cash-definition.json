A company's financial obligations can include standard operating costs, payments on debts, or investment activities.\n", "\nIn order to calculate net cash, you must first add up all cash (not credit) receipts for a period. This amount is often referred to as \"gross cash.\" Once totaled, cash outflows paid out for obligations and liabilities are deducted from gross cash; the difference is net cash.\n", "\nWhen net cash is used in relation to stock investing, it sometimes refers to an abbreviated version of the term \"net cash per share.\" Investors can use net cash to help determine whether a company's stock is an attractive investment.\n", "\nNet <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashflow.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cash flow</a> refers to either the gain or loss of funds over a period (after all <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debt.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">debts</a> have been paid).
