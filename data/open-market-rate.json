Debt securities include\u00a0government bonds, corporate bonds, certificate of deposit (CD), municipal bonds and preferred stock.\n", "\nOpen-market rates are sensitive and can frequently fluctuate. These rates respond directly to changes in supply and demand pressures within the open marketplace.\u00a0Distinguishing between open-market rate and open-market operations is essential. The latter is the structure in which the Federal Reserve can affect and control the supply of reserve balances available in the banking system. This\u00a0control is one of the primary tactics used by the Federal Reserve to implement monetary policy.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\u00a0\n", "\nOpen-market operations typically involve the buying and selling of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/governmentsecurity.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">government securities</a>\u00a0by one central bank in the open market. These transactions\u00a0allow for the expansion or reduction of the amount of money in the banking system at a given time. The purchase of securities creates an infusion of cash into the banking system, which promotes growth. By contrast, when securities sell, this will have the opposite effect and will shrink the economy.\n", "\nOpen-market rate differs from the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/discountrate.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">discount rate</a> and various other official rates that are set by the Federal Reserve.\u00a0The discount rate is the interest rate applied to commercial banks\u00a0and other depository financial institutions for loans received from the Federal Reserve's discount\u00a0window.\n", "\nThe Federal Open Market Committee\u00a0(FOMC), a committee within the Federal Reserve system, establishes a target for the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalfundsrate.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">federal funds rate</a>, which is the interest that banks charge each other to makes overnight loans from their Federal Reserve funds.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff The FOMC then uses activity within the open market for government securities to try and achieve that rate. This rate is significant because the federal funds rate, in turn, influences other significant categories of interest rates, including the open-market rate.\n", "\nThe open-market rates apply to any debt instrument that trades in the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/secondarymarket.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">secondary market</a>, where investors buy and sell securities from each other, as opposed to buying them directly from the issuing company. This\u00a0secondary market is sometimes also referred to as the \"aftermarket\". It involves investors making deals among themselves, without having to deal with the entity that initially issued the securities. This type of trading activity is what most people probably envision when they think about the stock market. The secondary market is a category that would include the well-known national exchanges such as the NASDAQ and the New York Stock Exchange. Bank commercial-loan rates do not fall into this category, as Fed policy primarily determines them.\n"]}
