Nasdaq now uses the Financial Status Indicator, which marks key issues beyond just bankruptcy filings, including a failure to meet Nasdaq listing requirements. Other markets and exchanges may still use \"Q\" to indicate a bankruptcy filing, however.\n", "\nNasdaq-listed securities generally have four letters in their listings. The fifth letter is an identifier and there are a number of them. This includes the letter A, which denotes Class A shares, or W, which denotes warrants.\n"]}
