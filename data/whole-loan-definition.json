Lenders of whole loans often sell them in the secondary market to institutional <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/portfoliomanager.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">portfolio managers</a> and agencies, such as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/freddiemac.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Freddie Mac</a> and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/091814/fannie-mae-what-it-does-and-how-it-operates.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fannie Mae</a>. Lenders sell their whole loans to reduce their risk. Rather than keeping a loan on their books for 15 or 30 years, by selling the whole loan to an institutional buyer, the lender can almost immediately recoup the principal.\n", "\nWhole loans are issued by lenders to borrowers for multiple purposes. A lender may issue a personal loan or a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortgage.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mortgage</a> loan to a borrower with specified terms determined by the credit issuer following the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underwriting.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">underwriting</a> process.

Various buyers are available for different types of loans in the secondary market. The mortgage market has one of the most well-established whole loan secondary markets, with agencies Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae serving as whole loan buyers. Whole loans are often packaged and sold in the secondary market through a process called <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/securitization.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">securitization</a>.

Lenders work with institutional dealers to list their loans on the secondary market. Lenders can sell personal, corporate, and mortgage loans. Loan portfolio managers are active buyers within the whole loan secondary market.\n", "\nLenders also have the option to package and sell loans in a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/securitization.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">securitization</a> deal. This type of deal is supported by an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investmentbank.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">investment bank</a> that manages the packaging, structuring, and sales process of a securitization portfolio. Lenders will typically package loans with similar characteristics in a securitization portfolio with various <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tranches.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tranches</a> that are rated for investors.\n", "\nResidential and commercial mortgage loans have a well-established secondary market through agency buyers Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, which typically buy securitized loan portfolios from mortgage lenders. Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae have specific requirements for the types of loans they buy in the secondary market, which influences the underwriting of mortgage loans for lenders.\n", "\nSuppose lender XYZ sells a whole loan to Freddie Mac. XYZ no longer earns interest on the loan, but it gains cash from Freddie Mac to make additional loans. When XYZ closes on those additional loans, it earns money from origination fees, points, and other closing costs paid by borrowers. XYZ also reduces its <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/defaultrisk.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">default risk</a> when selling the whole loan to Freddie Mac. It has essentially sold the loan to a new lender who services the loan, and the loan is removed from XYZ\u2019s\u00a0balance sheet.\n"]}
