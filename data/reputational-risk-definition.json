Reputational risk can occur in the following ways:\n", "\nIn addition to having good governance practices and transparency, companies need to be socially responsible and environmentally conscious to avoid or minimize\u00a0reputational risk.\n", "\nReputational risk is a hidden danger that can pose a threat to the survival of the biggest and best-run companies. It can often wipe out millions or billions of dollars in market capitalization or potential revenues and can occasionally result in a change at the uppermost levels of management.\n", "\n<strong>\ufeff</strong>Reputational risk can also arise from the actions of errant employees, such as egregious fraud or massive trading losses disclosed by some of the world's biggest financial institutions. In an increasingly globalized environment, reputational risk can arise even in a peripheral region far away from home base.\n", "\nIn some instances, reputational risk can be mitigated through prompt damage control measures, which is essential in this age of instant communication and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/social-media.asp\">social media</a> networks.

Regulators subjected the bank to fines and penalties, and a number of large customers reduced, suspended, or discontinued altogether doing business with the bank. Wells Fargo's reputation was tarnished, and the company continues to rebuild its reputation and its brand into 2019.\n"]}
