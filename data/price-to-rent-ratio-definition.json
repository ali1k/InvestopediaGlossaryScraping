This ratio is used as a benchmark for estimating whether it's cheaper to rent or own property. The price-to-rent ratio is used as an indicator for whether housing markets are fairly valued, or in a bubble.\n", "\nThe price-to-rent ratio is calculated by dividing the median home price by the median yearly rent and the formula for the price-to-rent ratio is as follows:\n", "\nThe price-to-rent ratio is used as an indicator for whether housing markets are fairly valued, or in a bubble.
