An Edge Act corporation (EAC) is a subsidiary of a U.S. or foreign bank that engages in foreign banking operations; these subsidiaries\u00a0are\u00a0named after the 1919\u00a0Edge Act, which authorized them. The Edge Act, named after the U.S. senator who sponsored it, was an amendment to the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/1913-federal-reserve-act.asp\">Federal Reserve Act of 1913</a>\u00a0that was introduced to increase the competitiveness of American financial firms on a global stage.\n", "\nA similar vehicle, an\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/agreement-corporation.asp\">Agreement corporation</a>,\u00a0is essentially a state-chartered Edge Act corporation.\u00a0In the U.S., banks may operate nationally as part of the National Association (NA) or as\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/state-bank.asp\">state-chartered banks</a>\u00a0within its borders. An agreement corporation is a permission given to a\u00a0bank\u00a0by a state that allows it to engage in international banking and transactions. Congress passed the Agreement Corporation Act in 1916. This new law authorized American banks to invest 10% of their capital into state-chartered banks and corporations permitted to finance projects internationally. The state-chartered bank would need to enter into an agreement with the\u00a0Federal Reserve, agreeing to be bound by the rules and regulations set out in the Act. It was from these agreements that the term \"agreement corporation\" arose.\n"]}
