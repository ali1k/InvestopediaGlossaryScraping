Max pain is the point where option owners (buyers) feel \"maximum pain,\" or will stand to lose the most money. Option\u00a0sellers, on the other hand, may stand to reap the most rewards.\n", "\nThe maximum pain theory is controversial. Critics of the theory are divided whether the tendency for the underlying stock's price to gravitate towards the maximum pain strike price is a matter of chance or a case of market <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/manipulation.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">manipulation</a>.\n", "\nMax pain is a simple but time consuming calculation.

However, it is\u00a0sometimes valuable to note when there is a large difference between the current stock price and the max pain price. There could be a tendency for the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">stock</a> to move closer to max pain,\u00a0but the effects may not be meaningful until expiration approaches.\n", "\nFor example,<em> s</em>uppose options of stock ABC are trading at a strike price on $48. However, there is significant open interest on ABC options at strike prices of $51 and $52. Then the max pain price will settle at either one of these two values because they will cause the maximum number of ABC's options to expire worthless.\n"]}
