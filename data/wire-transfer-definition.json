If an electronic form of payment takes longer than a few days, it cannot truly be considered a wire transfer. A domestic wire transfer is processed on the same day it is initiated and can be received within a few hours.

A domestic wire transfer only has to go through a domestic ACH and can be delivered within a day. International wire transfers must clear a domestic ACH and also its foreign equivalent (thus adding an additional day to the process).\n", "\nWire transfers cost money to initiate, regardless of whether they are domestic or international transfers.
