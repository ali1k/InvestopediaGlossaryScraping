A positive covariance means that asset returns move together\u00a0while a negative covariance means they move inversely. Covariance is calculated by analyzing at-return surprises (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standarddeviation.asp\">standard deviations</a> from the expected return)\u00a0or by multiplying the correlation between the two variables by the standard deviation of each variable.\n", "\nCovariance evaluates how the mean values of two variables move together. If stock A's return moves higher whenever stock B's return moves higher\u00a0and the same relationship is found when each stock's return\u00a0decreases, then these stocks are said to have positive covariance.

For example, in the capital asset pricing model (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capm.asp\">CAPM</a>),\u00a0which is used to calculate the expected return of an asset, the covariance between a security and the market is used in the formula for one of the model's key variables, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beta.asp\">beta</a>.
