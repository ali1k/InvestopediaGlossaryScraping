There are generally two types of gift cards: open loop and closed loop cards. Both types can typically be used online and in person.\n", "\nMany gift cards will have a minimum and maximum initial loading amount. A common minimum is $10, and a common maximum is $500. In some situations, they can be used to pay for a portion of a purchase with cash, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debitcard.asp\">debit</a> or credit used to balance the expense.

In this way, some gift cards are safer than cash.\n", "\nA gift card is a type of prepaid debit card loaded with funds for future use.\n", "\nClosed loop gift cards are often marketed by stores, allowing a cardholder to purchase anything from that specified retailer. Closed loop cards can generally only be used with a single merchant, either at the store or on its website. However, if one company owns several different retailers, it might issue gift cards that can be used at any of them. Gap Inc. (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=gps\">GPS</a>) is one such corporation: Its cards can usually be used interchangeably at any of its affiliated stores, including Gap, Banana Republic, Old Navy, and Athleta.\n", "\nClosed loop gift cards will usually not require any activation fees.

Funds on a closed loop gift card may also have a specified expiration date, which requires the user to use the card within a specific timeframe.\n", "\nClosed loop cards are popular gifts for wedding and baby registries. Many merchants also offer closed loop gift cards as a bonus for individuals who sign up for their registries.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/open-loop-card.asp\">Open loop cards</a> offer the equivalent of cash \u2013 or more precisely, a credit or debit card that can be used at any merchant where that card is accepted, as well as online. Many of the major charge or credit card issuers/processors, like American Express, Visa, Discover, and MasterCard, offer open loop gift cards. These cards will display the payment processor\u2019s logo and can be used to make all types of electronic payments nearly anywhere.\n", "\nOpen loop gift cards also have the advantage of serving as a standard prepaid card. These cards are usually reloadable allowing the user to add funds on their own as well.
