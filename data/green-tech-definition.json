Green tech\u2013which is an abbreviation of \"green technology\"\u2013can also refer to clean energy production; clean energy production is the use of alternative fuels and technologies that are less harmful to the environment than fossil fuels.\n", "\nAlthough the market for green technology is a relatively young, it has garnered a significant amount of investor interest due to increasing awareness about the impacts of climate change and the depletion of natural resources.\n", "\nGreen Technology is an umbrella term that describes the use of technology and science to create products and services that are environmentally friendly.\u00a0Green tech is related to cleantech, which specifically refers to products or services that improve operational performance while also reducing costs, energy consumption, waste,\u00a0or negative effects on the environment.\n", "\nThe goal of green tech is to protect the environment, repair damage done to the environment in the past, conserve natural resources and preserve the Earth's natural resources. Green tech has also become a burgeoning industry that's attracting enormous amounts of investment capital.\n", "\nThe use of green tech can be a stated goal of a business segment or a company. These goals are typically outlined in a company's environmental, sustainability, and governance (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/environmental-social-and-governance-esg-criteria.asp\">ESG</a>) statement, or can even be found in the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/missionstatement.asp\">mission statement</a> of a firm. Increasingly, socially responsible investors are looking to narrow down their prospective investments to only include companies that specifically employ or produce green technologies.\n", "\nWhile green tech has become increasingly popular in the modern age, elements of these business practices have been in use since the Industrial Revolution. Beginning in the Beginning in the early 19th century, manufacturers have sought to reduce their negative environmental <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/externality.asp\">externalities</a> by altering production processes to produce less soot or waste byproducts.

This type of investing is sometimes referred to as socially responsible investing (SRI). These investors may turn to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investment-fund.asp\">investment funds</a> known as green funds, SRI funds, or ESG funds.

However, it's important to note that the term \"green\" can have many interpretations and applications, and these vary from industry to Industry. If an investor is interested in supporting green technology initiatives through their investments, it's important for them to thoroughly research the validity of a given company's claims of green policies, standards, and accomplishments.\n", "\nGreen technology is used in the recycling process, as well as in waste incineration. Recyclable material can be used when manufacturing plastics, fertilizer, and fuel.\u00a0Green technology can also be a part of the production process, such as processes to recycle water or waste in the manufacturing process.\n", "\nGreen tech is used to purify water resources around the world. In parts of the world where there are scarce water resources, green technologies can be employed to purify dirty water or remove salt from seawater in order to increase the availability of clean drinking water.\u00a0\n", "\nGreen tech is used in processes that purify the air by reducing carbon emissions and gases that are released into the air from manufacturing plants.\n", "\nGreen tech can be used in processes intended to conserve energy, such as energy-efficient light fixtures. Green technology is also used to create alternative fuel sources that are more environmentally friendly than fossil fuels. Fossil fuels typically create waste as a byproduct of their production. Solar, wind, and hydroelectric dams are all examples of green technology because they are safer for the environment and don't produce fossil fuel waste by-products. Besides the environmental benefits of these alternative energy sources, they can also be used to power a home or a utility power plant.\n", "\nIn 2004, Starbucks Corporation\u00a0(<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=sbux\">SBUX</a>) performed a study to measure the company's greenhouse gas emissions. The study revealed that 70% of the company's emissions came from the purchase of electricity used to power their stores. As a result, the company has been working to source all of its power from renewable energy sources for all of its global store operations, including the company's global supply chain and corporate offices.\n", "\nAccording to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www.starbucks.com/responsibility/environment/water-and-energy\" rel=\"nofollow\">Starbucks</a>, in 2018 the company made investments into wind and solar energy. For example, in North Carolina, the company bought a 140,000-acre solar farm. This farm supposedly delivers enough clean energy to power an equivalent of 600 Starbucks retail stores. In 2019, the company also invested in wind projects, which are intended to provide power for 116 Seattle, Wash.-area stores, as well as stores in the state of Illinois.\n"]}
