A justified wage is the wage level that is high enough to attract workers but low enough to enable employers to offer employment. The divergence between a justified wage and the legal <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/minimum_wage.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">minimum wage</a> may depend on several factors including the state of the economy and level of unemployment.\n", "\nA justified wage combines economic factors of supply and demand in the workforce with more social and culturally relevant inputs like work experience, education and skills training, and type of job. A wage is justified when it is seen as socially acceptable while at the same time economically feasible for both workers and employers.\n", "\nFor instance, the justified wage for a worker in a fast-food chain with two years of experience may be around $10 per hour. An investment banker in a large city like New York, on the other hand, may command a justified wage of upwards of $150,000 with the same two years of experience.\n", "\nIn\u00a0a recession, the actual level of wages for this worker may drop to just above minimum wage due to the high level of unemployment and a stagnant economy. After the Great Recession, many investment banks justified lower wages due to slow economic growth.\n", "\nCompanies may compare their employees' salaries and work experience when determining a justified wage. For example, one current employee, has 10 years' experience and receives a salary of $65,000. Based on this information, management determines that another employee's justified wage is $60,000 given that they have eight years' experience.\n", "\nManagement may also consider other factors when establishing a justified wage, such as what responsibilities the employee has and the revenue they generate. For instance, the amount of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commission.asp\">commissions</a> a stockbroker writes could justify their wage. Employees can help determine their justified wage during pay reviews by discussing how they add value to the company.\n", "\nWhen determining a justified wage for a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/ceo.asp\">CEO</a>, the board of directors of a company typically considers:\n"]}
