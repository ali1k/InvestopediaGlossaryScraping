Often, these gaps are evident\u00a0during an economic downturn and are associated with higher unemployment numbers.\n", "\nSignificant reductions in economic activity for several months will indicate a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/recession.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">recession</a>. During periods of recession, companies will often pull back on spending, creating a gap from the contraction in the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/businesscycle.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">business cycle</a>.\n", "\nEconomists define a recessionary gap as a lower, real-income level,\u00a0as measured by <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/realgdp.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">real GDP</a>, than the real-income level at a point of full employment. Real GDP values all goods and services for a specific time-frame, adjusted for <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">inflation</a>. In the period leading up to a recession, there is often a significant reduction in consumer expenditure or investment due to a decrease in the take-home pay of\u00a0workers.\n", "\nWhen production levels fluctuate, prices change to compensate. This\u00a0price change is considered an early indicator that an economy is moving into a recession and may lead to less favorable <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exchangerate.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">exchange rates</a> for foreign currencies.\n", "\nAn exchange rate is merely one country's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currency.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">currency</a> in comparison with that of another country. At <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/parity.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">parity</a>, the two currencies exchange one for one.\n", "\nCountries might adopt <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monetarypolicy.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">monetary policies</a> to lower rates in an effort to encourage foreign investment or raise rates to encourage internal consumption of homemade products. The\u00a0change in exchange rates affects the financial returns on <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/export.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">exported</a> goods. Lower foreign exchange rates mean less income for exporting countries\u00a0and further drives a recessionary trend.\n", "\nAlthough it represents a downward economic trend, a recessionary gap can remain stable, suggesting short-term economic <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equilibrium.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">equilibrium</a> below the ideal, which can be as damaging to an economy as an unstable period. This instability is because prolonged downward periods of lower GDP production inhibit growth and contribute to sustained\u00a0higher <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unemployment.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">unemployment</a> levels.\n", "\nPolicymakers may choose to implement a stabilization policy (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expansionary_policy.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">expansionary policy</a>) to close the gap and increase real GDP. Monetary authorities might increase the amount of money in circulation in the economy by lowering <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">interest rates</a> and boosting government spending.\n", "\nA more important outcome of a recessionary gap is increased unemployment. During an economic downturn, the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/demand.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">demand</a> for goods and services lowers as unemployment rises. If prices and wages remain unchanged, this can further elevate unemployment levels.\n", "\nIn a cycle which feeds upon itself, higher unemployment levels reduce overall consumer demand, which reduces production, and lowers the realized GDP. As the amount of output continues to fall, fewer employees are required to meet production demand,\u00a0resulting in additional job losses and further reducing the need for goods and services.\n", "\nAs a company's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profit.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">profits</a> stagnate or decline, it cannot offer higher wages. Some industries may experience pay cuts due to internal business practices, or the effect of economic circumstances. For example, during a recession, people spend less on going out to eat, which means that restaurant workers receive less income in the form of tips.\n", "\nIn December 2018, the U.S. labor market as a whole was at full employment with an unemployment rate of 3.7% and there was no recessionary gap. However, not all parts of the country were at full employment, and some individual states were experiencing a recessionary gap.\n", "\nFor instance, New York was at full employment, and most large cities were economically secure. However, the picture was very different in rural areas where jobs were more difficult to find. In West Virginia, for example, the decimated coal mining industry brought the unemployment rate to 5.3% with little economic productivity. Additionally, West Virginia was one of four states with a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/poverty.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">poverty</a> rate above 18%.\n"]}
