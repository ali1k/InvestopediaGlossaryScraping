Companies buy back shares for a number of reasons, such as\u00a0to increase the value of remaining\u00a0shares available by reducing the supply or to\u00a0prevent other\u00a0shareholders from taking a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/controllinginterest.asp\">controlling stake</a>.\n", "\nA buyback allows companies to invest in themselves. Reducing the number of shares outstanding on the market\u00a0increases the proportion of shares owned by investors. A company may feel its shares are <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/undervalued.asp\">undervalued</a> and do a buyback\u00a0to provide investors with a return. And because the company is bullish on its current operations, a\u00a0buyback also boosts the proportion\u00a0of earnings that a share is allocated. This will raise the stock price if the same\u00a0price-to-earnings\u00a0(P/E) ratio is maintained.\n", "\nThe share repurchase reduces the number of existing shares, making each worth a greater percentage of the corporation. The stock\u2019s <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eps.asp\">earnings per share</a> (EPS)\u00a0thus increases while the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-earningsratio.asp\">price-to-earnings ratio</a>\u00a0(P/E) decreases or the stock price increases. A share repurchase demonstrates to investors that the business has sufficient cash set aside for emergencies and a low probability of economic troubles.\n", "\nAnother <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040815/what-situations-does-it-benefit-company-buy-back-outstanding-shares.asp\">reason for a buyback</a> is for compensation purposes. Companies often award their employees and management with stock rewards and stock options. To offer\u00a0rewards and options, companies buy back shares and issue them to employees and management. This helps avoid the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dilution.asp\">dilution</a> of existing shareholders.\u00a0\n", "\nBuybacks are carried out in two ways:\n", "\nA company can fund its buyback by taking on debt, with cash on hand, or with its cash flow from operations.\n", "\nAn expanded share buyback is an increase in a company\u2019s existing share repurchase plan. An expanded share buyback accelerates a company\u2019s share repurchase plan and leads to a faster contraction of its <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/03/030703.asp\">share\u00a0float</a>. The market impact of an expanded share buyback depends on its magnitude. A large, expanded buyback is likely to cause the share price to rise.\n", "\nThe <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/buyback-ratio.asp\">buyback ratio</a> considers the buyback dollars spent over the past year, divided by its <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp\">market capitalization</a> at the beginning of the buyback period. The buyback ratio enables a comparison of the potential impact of repurchases across different companies. It is also a good indicator of a company\u2019s ability to return value to its shareholders since companies that engage in regular buybacks have historically outperformed the broad market.\n", "\nA company's stock price has underperformed its competitor's stock\u00a0even though it has had a solid\u00a0year financially.

Trading at a\u00a0$20 per share stock price, its\u00a0P/E ratio is 20. With all else being equal, 100,000 shares would be repurchased and the new EPS would be $1.11, or $1 million in earnings spread out over 900,000 shares. To keep the same P/E ratio of 20,\u00a0shares would need to trade up 11% to $22.22.\u00a0\n", "\nA share buyback can give investors the impression that the corporation does not have other profitable opportunities for growth, which is an issue for <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/growthinvesting.asp\">growth investors</a> looking for revenue and profit increases.

If a company feels that its shares are undervalued then it may do a buyback to provide investors with a return.\u00a0The share repurchase reduces the number of existing shares, making each worth a greater percentage of the corporation. Another reason for a buyback is for compensation purposes. Companies often award their employees and management with stock rewards and stock options and a buyback helps avoid the dilution of existing shareholders.\u00a0Finally, a buyback can be a way to prevent other shareholders from taking a controlling stake.\n", "\nA company can make a tender offer, at a premium over the current market price, to shareholders where they have the option to submit all or a portion of their shares within a given time frame. Alternatively, a company may have an outlined share repurchase program that purchases shares on the open market at certain times or at regular intervals over an extended period of time. A company can fund its buyback by taking on debt, with cash on hand, or with the cash flow from operations.\u00a0\n", "\nA share buyback can give investors the impression that the corporation does not have other profitable opportunities for growth, which is an issue for growth investors looking for revenue and profit increases.\u00a0Buybacks can put a business in a precarious situation if the economy takes a downturn or the corporation faces financial issues it cannot cover. Another criticism of a buyback is that it can be used to inflate share price artificially in the market, which can also lead to higher executive bonuses.\n"]}
