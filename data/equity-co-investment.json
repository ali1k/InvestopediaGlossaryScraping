Equity co-investment enables other investors to participate in potentially highly profitable investments without paying the usual high fees charged by a\u00a0private equity fund.\n", "\nEquity co-investment opportunities are typically restricted to large institutional investors who already have an existing relationship\u00a0with the private equity fund manager\u00a0and are often\u00a0not available to smaller or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/retailinvestor.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">retail investors</a>.\n", "\nAccording to\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"http://www.valuewalk.com/2015/11/80-of-private-equity-investors-see-their-co-investments-outperform-commingled-funds/\" rel=\"nofollow\">a study by Preqin</a>, 80% of LPs reported better performance from equity co-investments compared to traditional fund structures. In a typical co-investment fund, the investor pays a fund sponsor\u00a0or\u00a0general partner (GP) with whom the investor has a well-defined private equity partnership. The partnership agreement outlines\u00a0how the GP allocates capital and\u00a0diversifies assets.

The number of LPs making co-investments in PE rose from 42 percent to 55 percent in the last five years. But direct investing LPs grew by only one percent from 30 percent to 31 percent during the same period.\n", "\nWhy would a private equity fund manager give away a lucrative opportunity? Private equity is usually invested through an\u00a0LP\u00a0vehicle in a portfolio of companies. In certain situations, the LP's funds may already be fully committed to a number of companies, which means that if another prime opportunity emerges, the private equity fund manager may either have to pass up the opportunity or offer it to some investors as an equity co-investment.\u00a0\n", "\nAccording to Axial, an equity raising platform, almost <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www.axial.net/forum/the-rise-of-co-investments-and-why-lps-want-more/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">80% of LPs </a>prefer\u00a0small to mid-market buyout strategies and $2 to $10 million per co-investment. In simple words, this means that they prefer to focus on less flashy companies with expertise in a niche area as opposed to chasing high-profile company investments. Almost 50% of\u00a0sponsors did not charge any management fee on co-investments in 2015.\u00a0\n", "\nEquity co-investment has accounted for a significant amount of recent growth in private equity fundraising since the financial crisis compared to\u00a0traditional fund investments. Consulting firm PwC <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/financial-services/regulatory-services/library/private-equity-co-investment.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">states</a> that LPs are increasingly seeking co-investment opportunities when negotiating new fund agreements with advisers because there is greater deal selectivity and greater potential for higher returns.\u00a0\n", "\nMost LPs\u00a0pay a 2% management fee and 20% carried interest to the fund manager who is the GP while co-investors benefit from lower fees or no fees in some cases, which boosts their returns.\n", "\nAt first glance, it would seem that GPs lose on fee income and relinquish some control of the fund through co-investments. However,\u00a0GPs can avoid capital exposure limitations or diversification requirements by offering a co-investment.\n", "\nFor example, a $500 million\u00a0fund could select three enterprises valued at $300 million. The partnership agreement might limit fund investments to $100 million, which would mean the firms would be leveraged by $200 million\u00a0for each company.\u00a0If a new opportunity merged with an enterprise value at $350, the GP would need to seek\u00a0funding outside its fund structure because it can\u00a0only invest $100 million\u00a0directly. The GP could\u00a0borrow $100 million for financing and offer co-investment opportunities to existing LPs or outside parties.\n", "\nWhile co-investing in private equity deals has its advantages, co-investors in such deals should read the fine print before agreeing to them.\n", "\nThe most important aspect of such deals is the absence of fee transparency. Private equity firms do not offer much detail about the fees they charge LPs. In cases like co-investing, where they purportedly offer no-fee services to invest in large deals, there might be hidden costs. For example, they may charge monitoring fees, amounting to several million dollars, that may not be evident at first glance from LPs.\n", "\nThere is also the possibility that PE firms may receive payments from companies in their portfolio to promote the deals. Such deals are also risky for co-investors because they have no say in selecting or structuring the deal. Essentially, the success (or failure) of the deals rests on the acumen of private equity professionals that are in charge. In some cases, that may not always be optimal as the deal may sink.\n", "\nOne such example is the case of Brazilian data center company Aceco T1.
