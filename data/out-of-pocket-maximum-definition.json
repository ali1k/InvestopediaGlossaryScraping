It is also called the out-of-pocket limit. These limits help policyholders control risk by capping their share of healthcare costs. It also helps insurers control risk by making policyholders responsible for part of their healthcare costs.\n", "\nAfter the policyholder meets the out-of-pocket maximum, the health insurance company pays 100%\u00a0of allowed healthcare expenses. This helps the individual avoid major financial problems associated with high healthcare costs in years when they\u00a0need\u00a0a lot of treatment.\n", "\nHealth <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurance-premium.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">insurance premiums</a> don't count toward the out-of-pocket maximum. Nor do balance billing charges for services you receive from out-of-network providers.\n", "\nAlso, costs that aren't considered covered expenses don't go toward the out-of-pocket maximum. For example, if the insured pays $2,000 for an elective surgery that isn't covered, that amount will not count toward the maximum. That means that a policyholder could end up paying more than the out-of-pocket limit in a\u00a0given year.\n", "\nStill, deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance all count toward the out-of-pocket maximum under the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/affordable-care-act.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Affordable Care Act</a>. For 2020, the out-of-pocket maximums are $8,150 for individuals and $16,300 for families.

Because your coinsurance is 40%, you would owe another $2,200 and the insurance company would cover the remaining $3,300\u2014that is if you didn't have an out-of-pocket maximum.\n", "\nHowever, your annual expenses are capped at $6,000. You've already paid $4,500, so you pay only $1,500 of the $5,500 balance. The insurance company picks up the remaining $4,000. Your total cost for the surgery is $6,000, and follow-up visits with your in-network doctor are paid by your insurance since you've met your out-of-pocket maximum for the year.\n"]}
