The model was first introduced in\u00a0the famous paper \"Expectations and Exchange Rate Dynamics,\" published in 1976 in the Journal of Political Economy.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\"></span> The model is now widely known as the Dornbusch Overshooting Model. Although Dornbusch's model was compelling, at the time it was also regarded as somewhat radical due to its assumption of sticky prices. Today, however, sticky prices are widely accepted as fitting with empirical economic observations. Today, Dornbusch's Overshooting Model is widely regarded as the\u00a0forerunner to modern international economics. In fact, some have said it \"marks the birth of modern international macroeconomics.\"<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\"></span>\n", "\nThe overshooting model is considered especially significant because it explained exchange rate volatility during a time when the world was moving from fixed to floating rate exchanges. According to Kennett Rogoff, IMF chief economist, the paper imposed \"rational expectations\" on private actors about exchange rates. \"...rational expectations is a way of imposing overall consistency on one's theoretical analysis,\" he wrote on the paper's 25th anniversary.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\"></span>\n", "\nSo, then, what does the overshooting model say?\u00a0Before Dornbusch,\u00a0economists generally believed that markets should, ideally, arrive at equilibrium, and stay there. Some economists had argued that <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volatility.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">volatility</a> was purely the result of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/speculator.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">speculators</a> and inefficiencies in the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/forex/f/foreign-exchange-markets.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">foreign exchange market</a>, like asymmetric information, or adjustment obstacles.\n", "\nDornbusch\u00a0rejected this view. Instead, he argued that volatility was more fundamental to the market than this, much closer to inherent in the market than to being simply and exclusively\u00a0the result of inefficiencies. More basically, Dornbusch\u00a0was arguing that in the short-run, equilibrium is reached in the financial markets, and in the long run, the price of goods responds to these changes in the financial markets.\u00a0\n", "\nThe overshooting model argues that the foreign <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exchangerate.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">exchange rate</a> will temporarily overreact to changes in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monetarypolicy.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">monetary policy</a> to compensate for sticky prices of goods\u00a0in the economy. This means that, in the short run, the equilibrium level will be reached through shifts in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-market.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">financial market</a> prices, so, the foreign exchange market, the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/moneymarket.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">money market</a>, the<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"5\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/derivative.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> derivatives market</a>, the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"6\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bondmarket.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bond market</a>, the stock market, etc.; but not through shifts in the prices of\u00a0goods themselves. Gradually, then, as the prices of goods unstick and adjust to the reality of these financial market prices, the financial market, including the financial exchange market, also adjusts to this financial reality.\n", "\nSo, then, initially, foreign exchange markets overreact to changes in monetary policy, which creates equilibrium in the short term. And, as the prices of goods gradually respond to these financial market prices, the foreign exchange markets temper their reaction, and create long-term equilibrium.\u00a0\n", "\nThus, there will be more volatility in the exchange rate due to overshooting and subsequent <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/correction.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">corrections</a> that would otherwise be expected.\u00a0\n"]}
