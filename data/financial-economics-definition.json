Financial decisions must often take into account future events, whether those be related to individual\u00a0stocks,\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/portfolio.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">portfolios</a>,\u00a0or the market as a whole.\n", "\nMaking financial decisions is not always a straightforward process.

Financial economics employs economic theory to evaluate how certain things impact decision making, providing investors with the instruments to make the right calls.\n", "\nFinancial economics usually involves the creation of sophisticated models to test the variables affecting a particular decision. Often, these models assume that individuals or institutions making decisions act rationally, though this is not necessarily the case. The irrational behavior of parties has to be taken into account in financial economics as a potential risk factor.\n", "\nThis branch of economics builds heavily on <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/microeconomics.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">microeconomics</a> and basic accounting<strong> </strong>concepts.<strong> </strong>It is a quantitative discipline that uses <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/econometrics.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">econometrics</a> as well as other mathematical tools.\n", "\nFinancial economics studies <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/fair-value/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fair value</a>, risk and returns, and the financing of securities and assets.

In contrast, financial economics\u00a0concentrates on exchanges in which money of one type or another is likely to appear on both sides of a trade.\u00a0\n", "\nThe financial economist can be distinguished from traditional economists by their focus on monetary activities in which\u00a0time,\u00a0uncertainty,\u00a0options\u00a0and information\u00a0play roles.\u00a0\n", "\nThere are many angles to the concept of financial economics.\u00a0Two of the most prominent\u00a0are:\n", "\nDecision\u00a0making over time recognizes the fact that the value of $1 in 10\u00a0years' time is less than the value of $1 now.
