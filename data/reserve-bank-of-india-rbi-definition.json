The Reserve Bank of India uses <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monetarypolicy.asp\">monetary policy</a> to create financial stability in India, and it is charged with regulating the country\u2019s currency and credit systems.\n", "\nLocated in Mumbai, the RBI serves the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/112614/increasing-importance-reserve-bank-india.asp\">financial market</a> in many ways. The bank sets the overnight interbank lending rate. The <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mibor.asp\">Mumbai Interbank Offer Rate</a> (MIBOR) serves as a benchmark for interest rate\u2013related financial instruments in India.\n", "\nThe main purpose of the RBI is to conduct consolidated supervision of the financial sector in India, which is made up of commercial banks, financial institutions, and non-banking finance firms. Initiatives adopted\u00a0by the RBI include restructuring bank inspections, introducing off-site surveillance of banks and financial institutions, and strengthening the role of auditors\n", "\nFirst and foremost, the RBI formulates, implements, and monitors India\u2019s monetary policy. The bank\u2019s\u00a0management objective is to maintain price stability and ensure that credit is flowing to productive economic sectors. The RBI also manages all <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreign-exchange.asp\">foreign exchange</a> under the Foreign Exchange Management Act of 1999. This act allows the RBI to facilitate external trade and payments\u00a0to promote the development and health of the foreign exchange market in India.\n", "\nThe RBI\u00a0acts as a regulator and supervisor of the overall financial system. This injects public confidence into the national financial system, protects interest rates, and provides positive banking alternatives to the public. Finally, the RBI acts as the issuer of national currency. For India, this means that currency is either issued or destroyed\u00a0depending on its fit for current circulation. This provides the Indian public with a supply\u00a0of currency in the form of dependable notes and coins, a lingering issue in India. In 2018 the RBI <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/news/india-central-bank-bans-many-crypto-transactions/\">banned</a> the use of virtual currencies by the financial agencies and banks that it regulates.\n", "\nThe RBI was originally set up\u00a0as a private entity, but it was nationalized in 1949. The reserve bank is governed by a central board of directors appointed by the national government. The government has always appointed the RBI\u2019s directors, and this has been the case since the bank became fully owned by the government of India as outlined by the Reserve Bank of India Act. Directors are appointed for a period of four years.\n", "\nAccording to its website, the current focus of the RBI is to continue its increased supervision of financial institutions, while dealing with legal issues related to bank fraud and consolidated accounting and attempting to create a supervisory rating model for its banks.\n"]}
