It began operations in January\u00a02016.\n", "\nThe Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) is\u00a0a multilateral development bank headquartered in Beijing. Like other development banks, its\u00a0mission is to improve social and economic outcomes in its region, Asia, and beyond. The bank opened in January 2016 and now has 86 approved members\u00a0worldwide.\u00a0\n", "\nChina's leader Xi Jinping first proposed an Asian infrastructure bank at an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asiapacific-economic-cooperation-apec.asp\">APEC</a> summit in Bali in 2013. Many observers have interpreted the bank as a challenge to international lending bodies, which some consider too reflective of\u00a0American foreign policy interests\u00a0such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.\n", "\nIn this bank's case, China controls half of the bank's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/votingshares.asp\">voting shares</a>, which gives the perception that the AIIB\u00a0will function in the interests of the Chinese government. The U.S. has questioned the bank's governing standards and its social and environmental safeguards, perhaps pressuring allies not to apply for membership. However, despite American objections, approximately half of NATO has signed on, as has nearly every large Asian country, with the exception of Japan. The result is widely considered in an indicator of China's growing international influence\u00a0at the expense of the United States.\n", "\nThe bank is headed by a Board of Governors composed of one Governor and one Alternate Governor appointed by each of the 86 member countries. A non-resident Board of Directors is responsible for the direction and management of the Bank such as the Bank\u2019s strategy,\u00a0annual plan and budget\u00a0and establishing policies and oversight procedures.\n", "\nThe bank staff is headed by a\u00a0President who is elected by AIIB shareholders for a five-year term and is eligible for re-election once. The President is\u00a0supported by Senior Management including\u00a0five Vice Presidents for policy and strategy, investment operations, finance, administration, and the corporate secretariat and the General Counsel and Chief Risk Officer.\u00a0Mr. Jin Liqun\u00a0is the current President.\n", "\nThe bank's priorities are projects that promote sustainable Infrastructure and to support countries that are striving to meet\u00a0environmental and development goals. The bank funds\u00a0projects linking countries in the region\u00a0and cross-border infrastructure projects for\u00a0roads,\u00a0rail, ports, energy pipelines and telecoms across Central Asia\u00a0and maritime routes in South East and South Asia\u00a0and the Middle East. The bank's priorities also include private capital mobilization and encouraging partnerships that stimulate private capital investment such as those with other multilateral development banks,\u00a0governments, and\u00a0private financiers.\n", "\nAn example of an AIIB\u00a0project is a rural road connectivity initiative that will benefit approximately <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www.aiib.org/en/news-events/news/2018/20180411_001.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">1.5 million rural residents</a> in Madhya Pradesh, India. In April 2018, the AIIB\u00a0announced the project, which\u00a0is also expected to improve the livelihoods, education, and mobility of the residents of 5,640 villages. The project is a\u00a0U.S. $140-million jointly financed by the AIIB and the World Bank.\n"]}
