This option allows employees to make after-tax contributions into their plans so that they'll owe nothing in taxes when they withdraw the money after retiring.\n", "\nEmployees new to federal employment can roll over <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/401kplan.asp\">401(k)</a> and individual retirement account (IRA)\u00a0assets into a TSP\u00a0and vice versa if they move to the private sector.\n", "\nThe TSP offers\u00a0a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/061113/breaking-down-tsp-investment-funds.asp\">choice of six funds</a> to invest in. These options are the\u00a0Government Securities Investment (G) Fund, the Fixed-Income Index Investment (F) Fund, the Common-Stock Index Investment (C) Fund, the Small-Capitalization Stock Index Investment (S) Fund, the International-Stock Index Investment (I) Fund, as well as specific\u00a0life-cycle (L) funds designed to include a mix of securities held in each of the individual funds.\n", "\nThe F, S, C, and I funds in the TSP are <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indexfund.asp\">index funds</a> currently managed by the BlackRock\u00a0Institutional Trust Company under contract by the\u00a0Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB). This independent government agency administers the TSP and acts as a fiduciary legally liable to manage the TSP prudently and in the best interests of participants and their beneficiaries.\n", "\nIndex funds in the TSP are designed to mimic the return characteristics\u00a0of the corresponding\u00a0benchmark index. For example, the C Fund is invested in a stock index fund replicating\u00a0the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sp500.asp\">Standard and Poor\u2019s 500 Index</a>, which is\u00a0made up of the stocks of 500 large to medium-sized U.S. companies. L funds are invested in the five individual TSP funds, and their asset allocations are based on the individual investor's time horizon.\n"]}
