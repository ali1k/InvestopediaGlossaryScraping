The YMPE determines the maximum amount on which to base contributions to the Canada or Quebec Pension Plan (C/QPP). The YMPE specifies the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earnings.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">earnings</a> amount that can be used in calculating pension contributions for each year.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"5\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff <span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nThe <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cpp.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Canada Pension Plan (CPP)</a> determines the maximum earnings amount for which contributions to the Canada Pension Plan can be made. According to the Government of Canada, the maximum pensionable earnings under the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) for 2020 are $58,700\u2014up from $57,400 in 2019.
