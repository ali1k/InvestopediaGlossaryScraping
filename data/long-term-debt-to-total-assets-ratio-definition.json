Although a ratio result that is considered indicative of a \"healthy\" company varies by industry, generally speaking, a ratio result of less than 0.5 is considered good.\n", "\nIf a company has $100,000 in total assets with $40,000 in long-term debt, its long-term debt-to-total-assets ratio is $40,000/$100,000 = 0.4, or 40%. This ratio indicates that the company has 40 cents of long-term debt for each dollar it has in assets. In order to compare the overall leverage position of the company, investors look at the same ratio for comparable firms, the industry as a whole, and the company's own historical changes in this ratio.\n", "\nIf a business has a high long-term debt-to-assets ratio, it suggests the business has a relatively high degree of risk, and eventually,\u00a0it may not be able to repay its debts. This makes lenders <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/062415/what-are-major-categories-financial-risk-company.asp\">more skeptical about loaning the business money</a> and investors more leery about buying shares.\n", "\nIn contrast, if a business has a low long-term debt-to-assets ratio, it can signify the relative strength of the business. However, the assertions an analyst can make based on this ratio vary based on the company's industry as well as other factors, and for this reason, analysts tend to compare these numbers between companies from the same industry.\n", "\nWhile the long-term debt to assets ratio only takes into account long-term debts, the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/totaldebttototalassets.asp\">total-debt-to-total-assets ratio</a> includes all debts. This measure takes into account both long-term debts, such as mortgages and securities, and current or short-term debts such as rent, utilities, and loans maturing in less than 12 months.\n", "\nBoth ratios, however, encompass all of a business's assets, including tangible assets such as equipment and inventory and intangible assets such as accounts receivables. Because the total debt-to-assets ratio includes more of a company's liabilities, this number\u00a0is almost always higher than a company's long-term debt to assets ratio.\n"]}
