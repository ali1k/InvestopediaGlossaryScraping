These policies are also known as \u201cpermanent\u201d or\u00a0\u201ctraditional\u201d life insurance.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/best-whole-life-insurance-4845955\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Whole life insurance policies</a> are one type of permanent life insurance. Universal life, indexed universal life, and variable universal life are others. Whole life insurance is the original life insurance policy, but whole life does not equal permanent life insurance.\n", "\nWhole life insurance guarantees payment of a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deathbenefit.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">death benefit</a> to beneficiaries in exchange for level, regularly due premium payments. The policy includes a savings portion, called the \u201ccash value,\u201d alongside the death benefit. In the savings component, interest may accumulate on a tax-deferred basis.\u00a0Growing cash value is an essential component of\u00a0whole\u00a0life insurance.\n", "\nTo build cash value, a policyholder can remit payments\u00a0more than\u00a0the scheduled premium.\u00a0Additionally, dividends can be reinvested into the cash value and earn interest.\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/082114/6-ways-capture-cash-value-life-insurance.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The cash value\u00a0offers\u00a0a living benefit to the policyholder</a>. In essence, it serves as a source of\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equity.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">equity</a>. To access cash reserves, the policyholder requests a withdrawal of funds or a loan. Interest\u00a0is charged\u00a0on loans with rates varying per insurer. Also, the owner may withdraw funds tax free up to the value of total premiums paid. Loans that are unpaid will reduce the death benefit by the outstanding amount.\u00a0Withdrawals reduce the cash value but not the death benefit.\n", "\nThe death benefit is typically a set amount of the policy contract. Some policies are eligible for dividend payments, and the policyholder may elect to have the dividends purchase additional death benefits, which will <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/wealth-management/032516/life-insurance-increasing-death-benefit.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">increase\u00a0the amount paid at the time of death</a>. Alternatively, unpaid outstanding loans taken against the cash value will reduce the death benefit. Many insurers offer <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rider.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">riders</a> that protect the death benefit in the event the insured becomes disabled or critically or terminally ill. Typical riders include an accidental death benefit and waiver of premium riders.\n", "\nThe named beneficiaries do not have to add money received from a death benefit to their gross income. However, sometimes the owner may designate that the funds from the policy be held in an account and distributed in allotments. Interest earned on the holding account will be taxable and should be reported by the beneficiary. Also, if the insurance policy was sold before the death of the owner, there may be taxes assessed on the proceeds from that sale.\n", "\nAs is the case with any kind of permanent policy, it's important to thoroughly research all firms being considered to ensure they're among the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/best-whole-life-insurance-4845955\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">best whole life insurance companies</a> currently operating.\n", "\nFor insurers, the accumulation of cash value reduces their\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/amount-at-risk.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">net amount of risk</a>. For example, ABC Insurance issues a $25,000 life insurance policy to S. Smith, the policy owner and the insured. Over time the cash value accumulates to $10,000. Upon Mr. Smith\u2019s death, ABC Insurance will pay the full death benefit of $25,000. However, the company will only realize a loss of $15,000, due to the $10,000 accumulated cash value. The net amount of risk at issue was $25,000, but at the death of the insured it was $15,000.\u00a0\n", "\nFrom the end of World War II through the late 1960s, whole life insurance was the most\u00a0popular insurance product. Policies secured income for families in the event of the untimely death of the insured and helped\u00a0subsidize\u00a0retirement planning.\u00a0After the passing of the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tefra.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (TEFRA)</a>\u00a0in 1982, many banks and insurance companies became more interest-sensitive.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"7\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff Individuals weighed the benefits of purchasing whole life insurance against investing in the stock market, where annualized return rates for the S&amp;P 500 were, adjusted for inflation, 14.76% in 1982 and 17.27% in 1983.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff The majority of individuals then began investing in the\u00a0stock market\u00a0and\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/termlife.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">term life insurance</a>, rather than in whole life insurance.\n"]}
