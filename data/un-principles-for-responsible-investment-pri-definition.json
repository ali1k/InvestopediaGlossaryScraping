These institutions participate by becoming signatories to the PRI\u2019s six key principles and then filing regular reports on their progress.\n", "\nThey core philosophy behind the organization is that environmental and social considerations are relevant factors in investment decision-making and should therefore be considered by responsible investors. For example, supporters of the PRI argue that it is both financially and ethically irresponsible to not consider the environmental impact of a company when assessing its merits as an investment. By contrast, many investors have historically viewed environmental and social impacts as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/051515/how-do-externalities-affect-equilibrium-and-create-market-failure.asp\">negative externalities</a> which can be ignored for purposes of investment decisions.\n", "\nTo combat this long-prevailing attitude, the PRI put forward six core principles, to which signatory companies must agree to commit themselves. As expressed on the organization\u2019s website, these six principles are as follows:\n", "\nCollectively, the organizations that have become signatories to these six principles are responsible for a total <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aum.asp\">assets under management (AUM)</a> of over $80 trillion.
