{"name": "Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) Definition", "@id": "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/esop.asp", "related": ["https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lesop.asp", "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accrued-benefits.asp", "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sar.asp", "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/iso.asp", "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-11-k.asp", "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockcompensation.asp"], "body": ["\nAn employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) is an employee benefit plan that gives workers ownership interest in the company. ESOPs give the sponsoring company, the selling <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholder.asp\">shareholder</a>, and participants receive various tax benefits, making them qualified plans. Companies often use ESOPs as a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corporatefinance.asp\">corporate-finance</a> strategy to align the interests of their\u00a0employees with those of their\u00a0shareholders.\n", "\nAn ESOP is usually formed to facilitate succession planning in a closely held company by allowing employees the opportunity to buy stock. ESOPs are set up as trust funds and can be funded by companies putting newly issued shares into them, putting cash in to buy existing company shares, or borrowing money through the entity to buy company shares. ESOPs are used by companies of all sizes including a number of large publicly traded corporations.\n", "\nSince ESOP shares are part of the employees' remuneration package, companies can use\u00a0ESOPs\u00a0to keep plan participants focused on corporate performance and share price appreciation. By giving plan participants an interest in seeing the company's stock perform well, these plans supposedly\u00a0encourage participants to do what's best for shareholders, since the participants themselves are shareholders.\n", "\nCompanies often provide employees with such ownership with no upfront costs. The company may hold the provided shares in a trust for safety and growth until the employee retires or resigns from the company. Companies typically tie distributions from the plan to vesting\u2014the proportion of shares earned for each year of service.\n", "\nAfter becoming\u00a0fully vested,\u00a0the company \"purchases\" the vested shares from the retiring or resigning employee. The money from the purchase goes to the employee\u00a0in a lump sum or equal periodic payments, depending on the plan. Once the company purchases the shares\u00a0and pays\u00a0the employee, the company redistributes or voids the shares. Employees who resign\u00a0or retire\u00a0cannot take the shares of stock with them, only the cash payment. Fired employees often only qualify for the amount they have vested in the plan.\n", "\nEmployee-owned corporations are companies with majority holdings held by their own employees. These organizers are like cooperatives, except that the company does not distribute its capital\u00a0equally. Many of these companies only provide voting rights to particular shareholders. Companies may also give senior employees\u00a0the benefit of more shares compared to new employees.\n", "\nStock ownership plans provide packages that act as additional benefits for employees to prevent hostility and keep a specific corporate culture that company managements want to maintain.\n", "\nOther versions of employee ownership include direct-purchase programs, stock options, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/restrictedstock.asp\">restricted stock</a>, phantom stock,\u00a0and stock appreciation rights.\u00a0Direct-purchase plans let employees purchase shares of their respective companies with their personal after-tax money. Some countries provide special tax-qualified plans that let employees purchase company stock\u00a0at discounted prices.\u00a0\n", "\nRestricted stock gives the employees the right to receive shares as a gift or\u00a0a purchased item after meeting particular restrictions, such as working for a specific period or hitting specific performance targets.\u00a0Stock options provide employees with the opportunity to buy shares at a fixed price for a set period, while phantom stock provides <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cash-bonus.asp\">cash bonuses</a> for good employee performance.\n", "\nThese bonuses equate to the value of a particular number of shares.\u00a0Stock appreciation rights give employees the right to raise the value of an assigned number of shares. Companies usually pay these shares in cash.\n"]}
