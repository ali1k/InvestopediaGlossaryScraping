The pact covered numerous issues including <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intellectualproperty.asp\">intellectual property rights</a>, public-sector investments and the easing of trade restrictions.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\"></span>\n", "\nVenezuela, under the leadership of Hugo Chavez, opted to not continue in the Group of 3 when the original agreement came up for renewal in 2006. Venezuela instead joined Mercosur, another <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/free_trade_area.asp\">free trade area</a> that predated the Group of 3. When Venezuela left, Colombia and Mexico agreed to continue as free trade partners for roughly nine more years.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\"></span>\n", "\nThe Group of 3 was among several free trade agreements that the government of Mexico entered into, the largest of which was the North American Free Trade Agreement\u00a0(<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nafta.asp\">NAFTA</a>). Mexico was the largest and most influential Group of 3 partner. The pact was part of the Mexican government\u2019s agenda to extend free trade throughout much of Central America, including Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\"></span>\n", "\nNotable modifications to the agreement included a decree to boost free trade in additional industries in December 2004 and a change that\u00a0Mexico and Colombia implemented in August 2011 to reduce tariffs on a range of additional products.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\"></span>\n", "\nMexico and Colombia ended their two-way alliance when each entered the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://alianzapacifico.net/en/what-is-the-pacific-alliance/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pacific Alliance</a> with Chile and Peru in 2014. The goal of this\u00a0agreement\u00a0was to boost\u00a0trade between all four countries and strengthen\u00a0economic ties to Asia as each country borders the Pacific Ocean.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\"></span>\n", "\nThe Group of 3 did not last for long, and Venezuela arguably never became a very strong participant in the pact. However, the Group of 3 succeeded in boosting trade between Mexico and Colombia.\n", "\nThe Group of 3 did aid the region\u2019s energy and utility sectors. One of the Group of 3's first projects was to link both power grids and gas pipelines from Mexico to Colombia and Venezuela. In October 2007, a gas pipeline opened between Colombia and western Venezuela, providing the opportunity for gas to flow to areas where it was not previously accessible.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\"></span>\n", "\nFrom Mexico\u2019s perspective, the Group of 3 became part of a strategy to open its trade policies in an effort to significantly boost exports. The Group of 3 offered Mexico a way to leverage labor markets throughout the region to produce finished goods that could then be sold into the United States and Canada via NAFTA. The Group of 3 did help to strengthen Mexico\u2019s position as Central America\u2019s most important trading partner, although other trade agreements arguably helped Mexico far more. The Group of 3\u00a0weakened\u00a0partly due to other regional trade agreements as well as bilateral agreements between countries in Central America and the U.S.\n", "\nConversely, Colombia and Venezuela seemed to have hoped that the Group of 3 would provide an eventual entry for them to join NAFTA; this never occurred.\n"]}
