Written premiums factor in the amount of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurance-premium.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">premium</a> charged for a policy that has already become effective, regardless of what portions have been earned. Written premiums are the principal source of an insurance company's revenues.\n", "\nPeople pay for insurance coverage to protect themselves\u00a0against financial loss. For example, if a policyholder has a car accident and is insured for it, the insurance company is obligated to foot the bill. In exchange for taking on this risk, the company charges its customers premiums.\n", "\nPremiums for insurance companies are like sales for retailers. Insurance companies sell as many premiums as possible and then use the money they generate to cover losses and expenses, hopefully with enough left to turn a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profit.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">profit</a>.\n", "\nWritten premiums calculate the total amount customers agree to pay for insurance policies sold during the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accountingperiod.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">accounting period</a>.

Insured policyholders pay premiums in advance, so insurers do not immediately consider\u00a0premiums\u00a0paid for an insurance contract as profit.\u00a0The insurer can change the status of the premium from unearned to earned only when its full obligation is fulfilled.\u00a0\n", "\nWritten premiums may be measured as a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/grossincome.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">gross</a> or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/net-premium.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">net</a><strong> </strong>number.\n", "\nThe gross figure does not factor in deductions from the commission paid to agents who sell the policies, legal expenses associated with settlements, salaries, taxes, clerical expenses, and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reinsurance.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reinsurance</a>, which is when insurance companies opt to transfer some of their risk to another insurer.\n", "\nAlternatively, written premiums can be measured as net, a figure that takes into account associated costs linked to a policy. Net premiums\u00a0written represents how much of the premiums the company gets to keep for assuming risk. As such, looking at changes to net premiums written from\u00a0year to year is a useful way to gauge the health of insurance companies.\n", "\nWritten premiums are the principal source of an insurance company's revenues and thus appear on the top line of the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incomestatement.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">income statement</a>.
