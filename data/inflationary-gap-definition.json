The inflationary gap is named as such because the relative rise in real GDP causes an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economy.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">economy</a> to increase its consumption, leading prices to climb in the long run.\n", "\nThe inflationary gap represents the point in the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/businesscycle.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">business cycle</a> when the economy is expanding. Due to the higher number of funds available within the economy, consumers are more inclined to purchase goods and services. As demand for goods and services increases but production has not yet compensated for the shift, prices rise to restore market <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equilibrium.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">equilibrium</a>.\n", "\nWhen the potential GDP is higher than the real GDP, the gap is instead referred to as a deflationary gap. The other type of output gap is the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/recessionarygap.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">recessionary gap</a>, which describes an economy operating below its full-employment equilibrium.\n", "\nAccording to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/macroeconomics.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">macroeconomic</a> theory, the goods market determines the level of real GDP, which is shown in the following relationship. To calculate real GDP, first compute the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nominalgdp.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">nominal GDP</a>:\n", "\nWhere:\n", "\nThen, the real GDP = Y/D, where D is the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gdppricedeflator.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GDP deflator</a>, which takes inflation into effect over time.\n", "\nAn increase in consumption expenditure, investments, government expenditure, or net exports causes real GDP to rise in the short run. Real GDP provides a measure of\u00a0economic growth while compensating for the effects of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">inflation</a> or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deflation.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">deflation</a>. This produces a result that accounts for the difference between actual economic growth and a simple shift in the prices of goods or services within the economy.\n", "\nA government may choose to use <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiscalpolicy.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fiscal policy</a> to help reduce an inflationary gap, often through decreasing the number of funds circulating within the economy. This can be accomplished through reductions in government spending, tax increases, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bond</a> and securities issues, and transfer payment reductions.\n", "\nThese adjustments to the fiscal conditions within the economy can serve to restore <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economic-equilibrium.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">economic equilibrium</a>. As the amount of money in circulation decreases, the overall demand for goods and services declines, too, reducing inflation.\n", "\nCentral banks also have tools at their disposal to combat inflationary activity.
