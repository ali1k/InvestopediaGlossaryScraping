Strategies aren't static, which means they need to be reviewed periodically as circumstances change.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\"></span>\n", "\nInvestment strategies are styles of investing that help individuals meet their short- and long-term goals. Strategies depend on a variety of factors, including:\n", "\nThis, of course, isn't an exhaustive list, and may include other details about the individual. These factors help an investor determine the kind of investments they choose to purchase, including stocks, bonds, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/money-marketfund.asp\">money market funds</a>, real estate, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetallocation.asp\">asset allocation</a>, and how much risk they can tolerate.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"6\"></span>\n", "\nInvestment strategies vary greatly. There isn't a one-size-fits-all approach to investing, which means there isn't one particular plan that works for everyone. This also means that people need to reevaluate and realign their strategies as they get older in order to adapt their portfolios to their situation. Investors can choose from <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valueinvesting.asp\">value investing</a> to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/growthinvesting.asp\">growth investing</a> and conservative to more risky approaches.\n", "\nAs mentioned above, people can choose to make their investment decisions on their own or by using a financial professional. More experienced investors are able to make decisions and investment choices on their own. Keep in mind that there is no right way to manage a portfolio, but investors should behave\u00a0rationally by\u00a0doing their own research using facts and data to back up decisions by attempting to\u00a0reduce risk and\u00a0maintain sufficient\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp\">liquidity</a>.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\"></span>\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risk.asp\">Risk</a> is a huge component of an investment strategy. Some individuals have a high tolerance for risk while other investors are <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskaverse.asp\">risk-averse</a>.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"6\"></span> Here are a few common risk-related rules:\n", "\nFor example, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurybond.asp\">U.S. Treasury bonds</a>, bills, and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/certificateofdeposit.asp\">certificates of deposit</a> (CDs)\u00a0are considered safe because they are backed by the credit of the United States. However, these investments provide a\u00a0low return on investment. Once the cost of inflation and taxes have been included in the return on income equation, there may be little growth in the investment.\n", "\nAlong with risk, investors should also consider changing their investment strategies over time.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"7\"></span> For instance, a young investor saving for retirement may want to alter their investment strategy when they get older, shifting their choices from riskier investments to safer options.\n", "\nInvestment strategies range from conservative plans to highly aggressive ones. Conservative investment plans employ safe investments that come with low risks and provide stable returns. Highly aggressive ones are those that involve risky investments, such as stocks, options, and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/junkbond.asp\">junk bonds</a>, with the goal of generating maximum returns.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\"></span>\n", "\nPeople who have a greater investment horizon tend to employ aggressive plans because they have a longer timeline while those who want to preserve capital are more likely to take a conservative approach.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\"></span>\n", "\nMany investors buy low-cost, diversified\u00a0index funds,\u00a0use\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp\">dollar-cost averaging</a>, and\u00a0reinvest\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp\">dividends</a>.\u00a0Dollar-cost averaging\u00a0is an investment strategy where a fixed\u00a0dollar\u00a0amount of stocks or a particular investment are acquired on a regular schedule\u00a0regardless of the cost or share price. Some experienced investors, though, select individual stocks and\u00a0build\u00a0a portfolio based on individual firm\u00a0analysis with predictions on share price movements.\n", "\nSome investors may choose strategies such as value and growth investing. With value investing, an investor chooses stocks that look as they though trade for less than their intrinsic value. This means that these stocks that the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market.asp\">market</a> is underestimating.

This means they can invest in things like stocks and real estate.\n", "\nA 45-year-old, on the other hand, doesn't have a lot of time to put money away for retirement and would be better off with a conservative plan. They may consider investing in things like <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp\">bonds</a>, government securities, and other safe bets.\n", "\nMeanwhile, someone saving for a vacation or home won't have the same strategy as someone saving for retirement.
