Schumpeter characterized creative destruction as innovations in the manufacturing process that increase <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/productivity.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">productivity</a>, describing it as the \"process of industrial mutation that incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within, incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one.\"\n", "\nBasically, the theory of creative destruction assumes that long-standing arrangements and assumptions must be destroyed to free up resources and energy to be deployed for innovation. To Schumpeter, economic development is the natural result of forces internal to the market and is created by the opportunity to seek <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profit.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">profit</a>.\n", "\nCreative destruction theory treats <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/11/five-economic-concepts-need-to-know.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">economics</a> as an organic and dynamic process. This stands in stark contrast with the static mathematical models of traditional Cambridge-tradition economics. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equilibrium.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Equilibrium</a> is no longer the end goal of market processes. Instead, many fluctuating dynamics are constantly reshaped or replaced by innovation and competition.\n", "\nAs is implied by the word destruction, the process inevitably results in losers and winners. Producers and workers committed to the older technology will be left stranded. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/entrepreneur.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Entrepreneurs</a> and workers in new technologies, meanwhile, will inevitably create <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/disequilibrium.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">disequilibrium</a> and highlight new profit opportunities.\n", "\nIn describing creative destruction, Schumpeter was not necessarily endorsing it. In fact, his work is considered to be heavily influenced by <em>The Communist Manifesto</em>, the pamphlet by <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/karl-marx.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Karl Marx</a> and Friedrich Engels which decried the bourgeoisie for its \"constant revolutionizing of production [and] uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions.\"<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\n", "\nExamples of creative destruction in history include Henry Ford's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/assembly-line-definition-4684004\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">assembly line</a> and how it revolutionized the automobile manufacturing industry. However, it also displaced older markets and forced many laborers out of work.\n", "\nThe internet is perhaps the most all-encompassing example of creative destruction, where the losers were not only retail clerks and their employers but also bank tellers, secretaries, and travel agents. The mobile internet added many more losers, from taxi cab drivers to mapmakers.\n", "\nThe winners, beyond the obvious example of programmers, might be just as numerous. The entertainment industry was turned upside down by the internet, but its need for creative talent and product remains the same or greater. The internet destroyed many small businesses but created many new ones online.\n", "\nThe point, as Schumpeter noted, is that an evolutionary process rewards improvements and innovations and punishes less efficient ways of organizing resources.
