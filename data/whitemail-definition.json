It also dilutes the firm's shares. Plus, since a friendly third party now owns and controls a large block of shares, the aggregate number of friendly shareholders increases.\n", "\nIf the whitemail strategy is successful in discouraging the takeover, then the company can either buy back the issued shares or leave them outstanding.\n", "\nThere are two main tactics employed to acquire a controlling interest in a company as a hostile takeover bid.\n", "\nFirst, the acquirer may make a\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tenderoffer.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tender offer</a>\u00a0to the company's shareholders. A tender offer is a bid to buy a controlling share of the target's stock at a fixed price. The price is usually set above the current market price to allow the sellers a premium as an added incentive to sell their shares.\u00a0This is a formal offer and may include specifications included by the acquirer such as an offer expiry window\u00a0or\u00a0other items. Paperwork must be filed with the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC), and the acquirer must provide a summary of its plans for the target company to aid the target company's decision.\n", "\nMany takeover defense strategies protect against tender offers, so often the proxy fight is utilized. The goal of a\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proxyfight.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">proxy fight</a>\u00a0is to replace board members who are not in favor of the takeover with new board members who would vote for the takeover. This is done by convincing shareholders that a change in management is needed and that the board members who would be appointed by the would-be acquirer are just what the doctor ordered.\n", "\nWhitemail is a strategy that can be used to fend off an unwanted takeover attempt by issuing shares at a below-market price and selling them to friendly a third party.\u00a0These new shares undermine the tender offer by making it relatively more expensive for the acquirer to attempt this route. At the same time, the new friendly shareholder will be less likely to agree to a tender offer or to a proxy fight to install new board members.\n", "\nWhitemail is just <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/08/corporate-takeover-defense.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">one of several defensive strategies</a> to avert a hostile takeover.\n", "\nXYZ Corporation has 1,000,000 shares outstanding. ABC Inc. wants to acquire XYZ Corp. and begins to buy up all of the shares they can in the public <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/secondarymarket.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">secondary market</a> in an attempt to get to a controlling proportion of shares.\n", "\nXYZ Corp. gets wind of this and proceeds to institute a whitemail policy. They issue 250,000 new shares at a significant discount to the current secondary market price and sell them all to DEF Industries, which is a company that XYZ has a good relationship with.\n", "\nThe increase of outstanding shares from 1,000,000 to 1,250,000 increases the number of shares ABC will need to purchase in order to gain a controlling interest. Plus, the voting rights of all XYZ shares are now diluted, reducing ABC's power to vote for board members who favor their takeover.\n"]}
