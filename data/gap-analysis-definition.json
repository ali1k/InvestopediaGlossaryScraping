This analysis is used to determine whether a company is meeting expectations and using its resources effectively.\n", "\nA gap analysis is the means by which a company can recognize its current state\u2014by measuring time, money, and labor\u2014and compare it to its target state.

It allows companies to determine where they are today and where they want to be in the future. Companies can reexamine their goals through a gap analysis to figure out whether they are on the right track to accomplishing them.\n", "\nGap analyses were widely used in the 1980s, typically in tandem with duration analyses. A gap analysis is considered harder to use and less widely implemented than duration analysis, but it can still be used to assess exposure to a variety of term structure movements.\n", "\nThere are four steps in a gap analysis, ending in a compilation report that identifies areas of improvement and outlines an action plan to achieve increased company performance.\n", "\nThe \"gap\" in a gap analysis is the space between where an organization is and where it wants to be in the future.\n", "\nThe four steps of a gap analysis are the construction of organizational goals, benchmarking the current state, analyzing the gap data, and compiling a gap report.\n", "\nGap analysis can be used by organizations of varying degrees, from large corporations to small businesses.
