Yacht insurance is an insurance policy that provides indemnity <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liability_insurance.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">liability coverage</a> for a sailing vessel. It includes liability coverage for bodily injury or damage to the property of others and damage to personal property on the vessel. Depending on the insurance provider, this insurance could also include gas delivery, towing, and assistance if your yacht gets stranded.\n", "\nSome companies specialize in providing coverage for antique and classic boats. You can choose between an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/actual-cash-value.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">actual cash value</a> or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/agreed-amount-clause.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">agreed value</a> policy.

Some companies also offer a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/multilineinsurance.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">package deal</a> that decreases the rate on a yacht insurance policy if you purchase additional policies, such as for your home or car.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"9\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nBoats are defined as vessels under 197 feet long, while ships are 197 feet long or longer.

A vessel under that size is a pleasure boat.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\u00a0For its own purposes, the National Boat Owners Association marks the dividing line at 27 feet. Most yacht coverage is broader and more specialized than pleasure boat coverage, because larger vessels travel farther and are exposed to greater risks.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nA yacht insurance deductible, the amount of money you must pay out of your own pocket before your insurance kicks in, is usually a\u00a0percentage of the insured value. A 1% deductible, for example, means that a boat insured for $100,000 would have a $1,000 deductible.
