Businesses and services are free of government control. Alternatively, free enterprise could refer to an ideological or legal system whereby\u00a0commercial activities are primarily regulated through private measures.\n", "\nIn principle and in practice, free markets are defined by private <a class=\"CMY_Link CMY_Valid\" data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/property_rights.asp\">property rights</a>, voluntary contracts, and competitive bidding for goods and services in the marketplace. This framework is in contrast to public ownership of property, coercive activity, and fixed or controlled distribution of goods and services.\n", "\nIn Western countries, free enterprise is associated with laissez-faire capitalism and philosophical libertarianism. However, free enterprise is distinct from capitalism. Capitalism refers to a method by which scarce resources are\u00a0produced and distributed. Free enterprise refers to a set of legal rules regarding commercial interaction.\n", "\nAnother definition of free enterprise is in terms of economics and was offered by the Nobel-winning economist <a class=\"CMY_Link CMY_Valid\" data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/friedrich-hayek.asp\">Friedrich Hayek</a>. Hayek described\u00a0such systems as \"spontaneous order.\" Hayek's point was that free enterprise is not unplanned or unregulated; rather, planning and regulation arise from\u00a0the coordination of decentralized knowledge among innumerable specialists, not bureaucrats.\n", "\nThe first written intellectual reference to\u00a0free enterprise systems may have emerged in China in the fourth or fifth century B.C., when Laozi, or Lao-tzu, argued that governments hampered growth and happiness by interfering with individuals.\n", "\nLegal codes resembling <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/08/free-market-regulation.asp\">free enterprise systems</a> were not common until much later. The original home of contemporary free markets was England between the 16th and 18th centuries. This growth coincided with, and probably contributed to the first industrial revolution and birth of modern capitalism. At one time, the English legal code was completely free of international trade barriers, tariffs, barriers to entry in most industries, and limitations on private business contracts.\n", "\nThe United States also used a largely free-market legal approach during the 18th and 19th centuries. In modern times, however, both the United States and the United Kingdom are better classified as mixed economies. Countries such as Singapore, Hong Kong, and Switzerland are more reflective\u00a0of free enterprise.\n", "\nIn the absence of central planning, a free enterprise legal system tends to produce capitalism although it is possible that voluntary socialism or even agrarianism could result. In capitalist economic systems, such as that of the United States, consumers and producers individually determine which goods and services to produce and which to purchase. Contracts are voluntarily entered into and may even be enforced privately;\u00a0for example, by\u00a0civil courts. Competitive bidding determines market prices.\n", "\nThe U.S. economic system of free enterprise has five main principles: the freedom for individuals to choose businesses, the right to private property, profits as an incentive, competition, and consumer sovereignty.\n"]}
