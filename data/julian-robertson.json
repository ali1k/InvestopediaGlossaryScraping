During the 1980s and the early 90s, Robertson was often referred to as\u00a0the \u201cFather of\u00a0Hedge Funds\u201d and\u00a0the \u201cWizard of Wall Street.\u201d\n", "\nJulian Robertson was born in Salisbury, North Carolina, in 1932 and graduated from the University of North Carolina in 1955. Following two years in the Navy, Robertson joined the New York office of Kidder, Peabody, &amp; Co. as a retail broker in 1957. He climbed the firm\u2019s ranks and eventually took the helm of its asset\u00a0management division, known as Webster Securities. Robertson departed Kidder, Peabody, &amp; Co. for a year-long sabbatical in New Zealand in 1979.\n", "\nWhile in New Zealand, Robertson hatched the idea for a new fund. He founded Tiger Management, one of the first hedge funds, upon his return to New York in 1980. Robertson used\u00a0initial assets believed to be approximately $8 million. Tiger\u2019s assets grew to $22 billion over the next two decades. The success of the fund is credited to Robertson\u2019s ability to identify investment opportunities within the framework of a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/globalmacro.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">global macro</a> trading strategy. Robertson frequently employed a long-short strategy, loading up on the best stocks he could find while shorting those he considered the worst.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"6\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nIn the late 1990s, Robertson was also known for his avoidance of tech investments during the buildup of internet stocks in the late 1990s. This\u00a0avoidance was a double-edged sword for Tiger Management. The fund performed well during the eventual collapse of the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tech_bubble.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tech bubble</a> but suffered from a drain of capital as investors took their money to Silicon Valley. An additional stressor came in the form of a large investment in U.S. Airways, which did not go well for Robertson.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"7\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff U.S. Airways would file for bankruptcy protection in 2002 and again in 2004.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"8\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nRobertson liquidated the Tiger Management fund in 2000 following a period of poor performance.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"9\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff He wrote that Tiger\u2019s success had been based on a rational approach to valuation and trading and that this strategy had proven less effective alongside the irrational growth of internet stocks.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"10\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff In the years that followed, Robertson focused his efforts on mentoring and investing with a slate of up-and-coming hedge fund managers known as the \u201cTiger Cubs.\u201d Prominent members of this group include <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/031216/john-griffins-success-story-net-worth-education-top-quotes.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">John Griffin of Blue Ridge Capital</a>, Ole Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global, Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management, and Steve Mandel, formerly of Lone Pine Capital.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"14\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"13\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"12\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"11\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nRobertson has been active in philanthropic activities since turning away from fund management.
