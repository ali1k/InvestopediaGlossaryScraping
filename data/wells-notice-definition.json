It usually takes the form of a letter, which notifies recipients both of the broad nature of the violations uncovered as well as the nature of the enforcement proceedings to be initiated against the recipient.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"5\"></span>\n", "\nThe Wells notice is named after the Wells Committee, formed in 1972 by then-SEC Chairman William J. Casey in order to review the enforcement practices and policies of the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp\">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC), and chaired by John Wells.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"6\"></span>\n", "\nThe receipt of a Wells Notice means that the SEC may bring a civil action against the person or firm named therein, and gives said person or firm the chance to offer information as to why such an action shouldn\u2019t be brought.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"5\"></span>\n", "\nAfter receiving a Wells Notice, recipients have a chance for prospective defendants in SEC enforcement proceedings to speak on their own behalves, directly to the decision-makers involved in the case.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"10\"></span>\n", "\nA prospective defendant\u2019s response to a Wells Notice is known as a Wells Submission<em>.</em> Prospective defendants have a certain number of days to make a Wells Submission, which should take the form of a legal brief, and include both factual and legal arguments to prove why charges should not be brought against the prospective defendants.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"5\"></span>\n", "\nA Wells Submission, and its contents, are public information, and as a result, most securities law attorneys may advise that making such a submission is not always to the prospective defendants\u2019 best interests. Anything alleged in the Wells Submission can be used against the defendant in the enforcement proceedings; it can also be subpoenaed and used against the respondents in any other civil litigation brought against the defendants.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"11\"></span>\n", "\nIn some cases, regulators are willing to start a dialog with the accused party at the conclusion of their investigation, but before issuing a formal Wells Notice. When this occurs, it may be referred to as a \u201cpre-Wells\u201d process.\n", "\nThis process will often include written submissions and oral arguments made by the defense counsel. The SEC may be willing to engage in a pre-Wells process if a case involves novel or highly technical issues, or significant policy questions. In other cases, the SEC is willing to allow a pre-Wells process because they believe it will facilitate reaching a settlement. Finally, there may be extenuating circumstances in a particular case that cause regulators to be willing to proceed on a pre-Wells basis.\n"]}
