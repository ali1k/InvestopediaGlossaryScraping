A LIFO liquidation occurs when current sales exceed purchases, resulting in the liquidation of any inventory not sold in a previous period.\u00a0\n", "\nThe LIFO method is a financial practice in which a company sells the most recent inventory purchased first.\u00a0LIFO matches the most recent costs against current <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/analyst/071502.asp\">revenues</a>. Some companies use the LIFO method during periods of inflation when the cost to purchase inventory increases over time.\u00a0The LIFO method provides tax benefits as the higher costs associated with new inventories seemingly offset profits, resulting in a lower tax burden.\n", "\nABC Company uses the LIFO method of inventory accounting for its domestic stores.
