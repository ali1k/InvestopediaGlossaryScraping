Difficulties happen especially if the rate is in the form of an inflation benchmark, such as the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumerpriceindex.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Consumer Price Index (CPI</a>\u00a0or as a measure of economic health, such as the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unemploymentrate.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">unemployment rate</a>\u00a0or corporate <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/defaultrate.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">default rate</a>.\n", "\nReference rates are at the core of an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/arm.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM)</a>. With an ARM, the borrower's interest rate will be the reference rate, usually the prime rate, plus an additional fixed amount, known as the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spread.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">spread</a>. From the lender's viewpoint, the reference rate is a guaranteed rate of borrowing. At a minimum, the lender always earns the spread as profit. For the borrower, however, changes in the reference rate can have a definite\u00a0financial impact. If the reference rate makes a sudden move upward, borrowers who pay <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/floatinginterestrate.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">floating interest rates</a>\u00a0can\u00a0see their payments rise dramatically.\n", "\nReference rates also form the benchmark for an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrateswap.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">interest rate swap</a>.\u00a0In an interest rate swap, the floating reference rate is exchanged by one party for\u00a0a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixedinterestrate.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fixed interest rate</a> or a set of payments.\u00a0The reference rate will\u00a0determine the floating interest rate portion of the contract.\n", "\nLet's say a homebuyer needs to borrow $40,000 to help finance the purchase of a new home. The bank offers a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/variableinterestrate.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">variable interest rate</a> loan at prime plus 1%. That means\u00a0the interest rate for the loan equals the prime rate\u00a0plus 1%. Therefore, if the prime rate is 4%, then your mortgage carries an interest rate of 5% (4%+1%). In this case, the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/primerate.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">prime rate</a> is the reference rate.\n", "\nThe bank may \"reset\" the rate from time to time as the reference rate fluctuates. When the prime rate goes up, your rate\u00a0also goes up. Adversely, when the prime rate\u00a0falls, so does your payment rate. By allowing the bank to \"reset\" the rate, it avoids the chance that the borrower may <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/default2.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">default</a> on the loan, which causes the bank to lose money.

TIPS will pay interest every six months using the basis of a fixed rate applied to the underlying principle. Calculation of interest uses the adjusted principal multiplied by one-half of the interest rate. On <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maturity.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">maturity</a>, the U.S. Treasury will pay either the original or an adjusted principal, whichever is higher.\u00a0\n"]}
