Fixed assets are not expected to be consumed or converted into cash within a year. Fixed assets most commonly appear on the balance sheet as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/ppe.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">property, plant, and equipment</a> (PP&amp;E).

Current assets are typically liquid assets that will be converted into cash in less than a year. Noncurrent assets refer to assets and property owned by a business that are not easily converted to cash. The different categories of noncurrent assets include fixed assets, intangible assets, long-term investments, and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deferredcharge.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">deferred charges</a>.\n", "\nA fixed asset is bought for production or supply of goods or services, rental to third parties, or use in an organization. The term \u201cfixed\u201d translates to the fact that these assets will not be used up or sold within the accounting year.

In some cases, the asset may become obsolete and will, therefore, be disposed of without receiving any payment in return.
