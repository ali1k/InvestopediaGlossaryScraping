Under <a class=\"CMY_Link CMY_Valid\" data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/contract-theory.asp\">contract law</a>, implied authority figures have the ability to make a legally binding contract on behalf of another person or company.\n", "\nImplied authority is an authority that is not express or written into a\u00a0contract, but it is authority an\u00a0agent is assumed to have in order to transact the business\u00a0for a\u00a0principal. Implied authority is incidental to express authority since not every single detail of an agent's authority can be spelled out in the written contract. For example, in real estate, express authority means the agent has been given the authority to act on behalf of the principal.\n", "\nImplied authority applies to the insurance company agent that is\u00a0given the authority to solicit applications for <a class=\"CMY_Link CMY_Valid\" data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lifeinsurance.asp\">life insurance</a> on behalf of the insurer. When the insurer gives the agent that express authority, it also gives the agent the implied authority to telephone prospects on its behalf to arrange sales appointments.\u00a0Implied authority also applies in a situation where a person is wearing a uniform or nametag bearing the\u00a0logo\u00a0or trademark of a business or organization.\u00a0\n", "\nIf a server at a restaurant\u00a0tells you they\u00a0can give you a free beverage with the purchase of an\u00a0entree, they have\u00a0made a contract with you on behalf of the restaurant business\u00a0they\u00a0are\u00a0representing. The server's authority is implied\u00a0by the fact that they have been chosen as the\u00a0sole <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/12/employess-investors.asp\">employee</a> of the business\u00a0designated to do business\u00a0with you. Whether or not other employees ultimately get involved in the transaction is immaterial\u00a0because it is expected that they will be the\u00a0only person required to complete your business transaction.\n", "\nIn such a\u00a0situation, if a\u00a0restaurant\u00a0manager came to your table and informed you that the server\u00a0made a mistake and tried\u00a0to take back the\u00a0\"free beverage with\u00a0paid entree\" offer,\u00a0the business would\u00a0actually be\u00a0in direct violation of a legally enforceable contract made between you, the client, and their employee.\u00a0They may certainly penalize the employee if they choose, but implied authority legally obliges them\u00a0to honor the terms of the agreement.\u00a0The same principle applies to more complex or extreme legal circumstances.\n", "\nBy contrast, \"expressed authority\" is\u00a0clearly\u00a0stated and\u00a0granted by the principal to the agent either orally or in writing...and\u00a0\"apparent authority,\" sometimes called \"ostensible\u00a0authority,\"\u00a0exists where a principal's actions could result in a third party (as a reasonable person) believing the agent had authority even where it may not be expressed or implied.\n"]}
