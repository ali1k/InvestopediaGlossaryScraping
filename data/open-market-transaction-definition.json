But before they can buy or sell their shares, known as open-market transactions, they must file the correct paperwork and follow all procedures.\n", "\nAn open-market transaction is simply an order placed by an insider to buy or sell shares according to the rules and regulations set out by the SEC.

The same could be said about the purchase of more shares in the company.\n", "\nWhen certain open market transactions occur, companies might issue press statements about the open-market transactions that involve prominent insiders buying shares. For example, if a chairman buys one million shares in their own company, an accompanying statement could declare this is an affirmation of faith in the management.\n", "\nThe purchase price of those shares will also be listed.
