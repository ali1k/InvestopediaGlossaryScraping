This list begins with a spouse and other close relatives and continues to include more distant relatives and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditor.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">creditors</a>.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nIf the executor or personal representative is filing a full tax return on behalf of the deceased individual, they must submit <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/1040.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Form 1040</a> along with Form 1310 directing the IRS to pay a refund. The executor may also need to file taxes owed by the estate rather than the individual. In this case, the representative will be required to file a Form 1041 along with a 1310 form. The 1041 form would be required only if the estate generates more than $600 in income per year.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"6\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nIf filing a Form 1310 along with a Form 1041, the executor must be aware that the IRS will issue the refund to the estate rather than to any individual.
