The CRA requires federal regulators to assess how well each bank fulfills its obligations to these communities. This score is used to evaluate applications for future approval of bank\u00a0mergers, charters, acquisitions, branch openings, and deposit facilities.\n", "\nThe CRA was passed to reverse the urban blight that had become evident in many American cities by the 1970s. In particular, one goal was to reverse the effects of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/redlining.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">redlining</a>, a decades-long practice by which the federal government and banks had actively discouraged and avoided making loans to lower-income and minority neighborhoods.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff The objective of the act was to strengthen existing laws that required banks to sufficiently address the banking needs of all members of the communities they served.\n", "\nThree federal regulators\u2014the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/office-comptroller-currency-occ.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Office of the Comptroller of the Currency</a>, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/frb.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System</a>\u2014share an oversight role with respect to the CRA. However, the last is chiefly responsible for assessing whether state member banks are fulfilling their obligations under the law.\n", "\nThe <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalreservebank.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Federal Reserve</a> uses one of five methods to rank a bank\u2019s performance based on its size and mission. While a 1995 update to the CRA requires regulators to consider lending and investment data, the evaluation process is somewhat subjective with no specific quotas that banks have to satisfy.\n", "\nEach bank is given one of the following ratings:\n", "\nThe Fed publishes an online database that members of the public can use to see a particular bank\u2019s score. Banks are also obliged to provide consumers with their performance evaluations upon request.\n", "\nThe CRA applies to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fdic.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FDIC-insured</a> depository institutions, including national banks, state-chartered banks, and savings associations. However, credit unions backed by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund and other non-bank entities are exempt from the legislation.\n", "\nCritics of the CRA, including a number of conservative politicians and pundits, alleged that the law was a contributing factor in the risky lending practices that led up to the financial crisis of 2008. They alleged that banks and other lenders relaxed certain standards for mortgage approvals to satisfy CRA examiners.\n", "\nSome economists, however, including Neil Bhutta and Daniel Ringo of the Federal Reserve Bank, argued in 2015 that CRA-based mortgages represented a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/notes/feds-notes/2015/assessing-the-community-reinvestment-acts-role-in-the-financial-crisis-20150526.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">small percentage</a> of the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/subprime_mortgage.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">subprime loans</a> issued during the financial crisis. As a result, Bhutta and Ringo concluded that the law was not a major factor in the housing market\u2019s subsequent downturn.\n", "\nThe CRA has also received criticism that it has not been particularly effective. While low- and moderate-income communities saw an influx of loans after the CRA\u2019s passage, research by the Federal Reserve\u2019s Jeffrey Gunther concluded that lenders not subject to the law\u2014that is, credit unions and other non-banks\u2014represented an equal share of those loans.\n", "\nMore recently, some economists and policymakers have suggested that the law needs to be revised to make the evaluation process less onerous for banks and to keep up with changes in the industry. For example, the physical location of bank branches remains a component in the scoring process, even though an increasing number of consumers are conducting their banking online.\n", "\nIn a 2018 <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/opinion/we-have-a-once-in-a-generation-chance-to-revamp-cra-lets-use-it\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">op-ed piece</a>, Comptroller of the Currency Joseph Otting asserted that the CRA\u2019s outdated approach had led to \u201cinvestment deserts,\u201d where lending is not encouraged because of the lack of nearby bank branches.

But Otting said it \"strengthened and modernized\" the law. He said the final rule increases credit for mortgage origination to promote affordable mortgage availability in lower and moderate income areas, and revises the approach to deposit-based assessment by focusing on the growing number of internet banks and banks that don't rely on brick-and-mortar branches.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www.occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2018/nr-occ-2018-87.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> </a>\n"]}
