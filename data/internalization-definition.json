This process may apply to business and investment transactions, or to the corporate world.\n", "\nIn business, internalization is a transaction conducted within a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corporation.asp\">corporation</a> rather than in the open market. Internalization also occurs in the investment world, when a brokerage firm fills a buy order for shares from its own inventory of shares instead of executing the trade using outside inventory.\n", "\nInternalization can also apply to a multinational corporation. This happens when the company decides to shift assets between its own subsidiaries in different countries.\n", "\nInternalization can occur when an individual, business, or firm decides to handle an issue <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/in-house.asp\">in-house</a> instead of outsourcing it to a third-party.\n", "\nCompanies may decide to internalize the production of a particular material on its own rather than having another manufacturer do so. This process is called internal sourcing, or delivering products to customers through the business\u2019s own channels instead of using an outside shipping company.\n", "\nInternalization is beneficial to a company as it cuts down the costs of outsourcing certain process such as manufacturing or selling products and services. The process also provides benefits to brokers, who can make money on the spread, or on the difference between the purchase and sale price.\n", "\nA trade may be internalized when the trade is completed for an investor within their brokerage firm. The process is often less expensive than alternatives as it is not necessary to work with an outside firm to complete the transaction.\n", "\nBrokerage firms that internalize securities orders can also take advantage of the difference between what they purchased shares for and what they sell them for, known as the spread. For example, a firm may see a greater spread by selling its own shares than by selling them on the open market. Additionally, because share sales\u00a0are not conducted on the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/open-market.asp\">open market</a>, the brokerage firm is less likely to influence prices if it sells a large portion of shares.\n", "\nInternal sourcing refers to the process of acquiring any needed asset, service, or material from within the business instead of from an external source. This commonly refers to a business\u2019s decision to produce goods internally instead of retaining an outside supplier.\n", "\nInternal sourcing can also refer to internal hiring practices where preference is given to current employees when recruiting for a vacancy, as well as choosing to keep certain business activities within the business structure, such as with marketing activities.\n", "\nA business may work to keep its financing source internalized, focusing on the reinvestment of certain assets back into the business instead of acquiring outside financing or investment.\n"]}
