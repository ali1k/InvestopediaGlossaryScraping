The agreement also provided a system to arbitrate commercial disputes among nations, and the framework enabled a number of multilateral negotiations for the reduction of tariff barriers. The GATT was regarded as a significant success in the postwar years.\n", "\nOne of the key achievements of the GATT was that of trade without discrimination. Every signatory member of the GATT was to be treated as equal to any other.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"7\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff This is known as the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mostfavorednation.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">most-favored-nation principle</a>, and it has been carried through into the WTO.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"8\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff A practical outcome of this was that once a country had negotiated a tariff cut with some other countries (usually its most important trading partners), this same cut would automatically apply to all GATT signatories. Escape clauses did exist, whereby countries could negotiate exceptions if their domestic producers would be particularly harmed by tariff cuts.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"9\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nMost nations adopted the most-favored-nation principle in setting tariffs, which largely replaced quotas. Tariffs (preferable to quotas but still a trade barrier) were in turn cut steadily in rounds of successive negotiations.\n", "\nThe GATT held eight rounds of meetings between April 1947 and December 1993. Each of the conferences had significant achievements and outcomes.\n", "\nThis series of meetings and reduced tariffs would continue, adding new GATT provisions in the process. The average tariff rate fell from around 22%, when the GATT was first signed in Geneva in 1947, to around 5% by the end of the Uruguay Round, concluded in 1993, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/investing/what-is-the-world-trade-organization/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">which also negotiated the creation of the WTO</a>.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"13\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff\n", "\nIn 1964 the GATT began to work toward curbing <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/predatory-pricing.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">predatory pricing</a> policies.
