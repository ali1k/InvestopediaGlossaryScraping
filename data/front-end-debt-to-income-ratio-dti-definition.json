If a homeowner has a mortgage, the front-end DTI is typically calculated as housing expenses (such as mortgage payments, mortgage insurance, etc.) divided by gross income. In contrast, a back-end DTI calculates the percentage of gross income going toward\u00a0other <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debt.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">debt</a> types, such as credit cards or car loans.

Multiply the result by 100, and that is your front-end DTI ratio. For instance, if all your housing-related expenses total $1,000 and your monthly income is $3,000, your DTI is 33%.\n", "\nTo qualify for a mortgage, the borrower often must have a front-end debt-to-income\u00a0ratio of less than an indicated level.

For example, in 2009, many homeowners had front-end DTIs that were significantly higher than average, and, consequently, mortgage defaults began to rise.
