Sanctions can be unilateral, imposed by only one country on one other country, or multilateral, imposed by one or more countries on a number of different countries. Sometimes,\u00a0allies will impose multilateral sanctions on unfriendly states.\n", "\nTrade sanctions have the express purpose of making it more difficult if not impossible for the nation(s) bearing the sanction to trade with the nation imposing it.\n", "\nTrade sanctions act as a sort of stick and carrot in foreign\u00a0and economic policy in international politics and trade. Governments impose sanctions with the express purpose of changing the behavior and policy of another government or state.\n", "\nWhile trade sanctions often produce their desired results over time, one major problem with sanctions can be that their impact is often felt more powerfully by innocent, impoverished citizens, and not government officials or the business leaders and other elites driving and enacting the country's policy.\n", "\nThe United Nations uses economic and military sanctions, including embargoes and other sanctions, instead of or in addition to military interventions against regimes the UN Security Council\n", "\nTrade sanctions can be either unilateral or bilateral. Unilateral sanctions are enacted by a single country, while a group or block of countries enacts bilateral or multilateral sanctions.\n", "\nBilateral sanctions are generally considered less risky because no one country can be held responsible for the effect of the sanctions. However, unilateral sanctions can be very effective, if enacted by a large economic power.\u00a0\n", "\nThe most common\u00a0types of trade sanctions are <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quota.asp\">quotas</a>, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tariff.asp\">tariffs</a>, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nontariff-barrier.asp\">non-tariff barriers (NTBs)</a>, asset freezes or seizures, and\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/embargo.asp\">embargoes</a>.\n"]}
