Financial account components include direct investment, portfolio investment and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reserve-assets.asp\">reserve assets</a> broken down by sector.\n", "\nWhen recorded in a country\u2019s balance of payments, nonresidents' claims made\u00a0on residents' financial assets are\u00a0liabilities, while claims made against nonresidents by residents are\u00a0assets.\n", "\nThe financial account is\u00a0a tracking mechanism for shifts in international asset ownership, and it is composed\u00a0of two subaccounts. The first subaccount\u00a0includes\u00a0domestic ownership of foreign assets, such as foreign bank deposits and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp\">securities</a> in foreign companies. The second subaccount\u00a0includes\u00a0foreign ownership of domestic assets, such as the purchase of government <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp\">bonds</a> by foreign entities or loans provided to domestic banks by foreign institutions.\n", "\nIf the domestic ownership of foreign assets portion of the financial account increases, it increases the overall financial account. If the foreign ownership of domestic assets increases, it decreases the overall financial account; the overall financial account increases when the foreign ownership of domestic assets decreases.\n", "\nThe financial account differs from the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalaccount.asp\">capital account</a> in that the capital account records\u00a0transfers of capital assets. Transactions in the capital account have no impact on a country\u2019s production levels, the rate of savings,\u00a0or overall income.\n", "\nThe current account is a\u00a0reflection of the country\u2019s current <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bot.asp\">trade balance</a>, combined with net income and direct payments, and measures the import\u00a0and export\u00a0of goods and services. When combined with the financial and capital accounts, the three accounts form a\u00a0country\u2019s balance of payments.\n", "\nThe financial account involves financial assets\u00a0such as gold, currency, derivatives, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sdr.asp\">special drawing rights</a>, equities, and bonds. During a complex transaction that contains both capital assets and financial claims, a country may record part of a transaction in its capital account and the other part in its <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentaccount.asp\">current account</a>.\n", "\nIn addition, because entries in the financial account are net entries that offset credits with debits, they may not appear in a country\u2019s balance of payments, even if transactions are occurring between residents and nonresidents.\n", "\nEasing access to a country\u2019s capital is considered part of a broader movement toward economic liberalization, and a more liberalized financial account opens\u00a0a country up to capital markets.\n", "\nHowever, reducing restrictions on\u00a0the financial account has risks. The more a country\u2019s economy is integrated with other economies worldwide, the greater\u00a0the likelihood that economic troubles abroad will affect the domestic situation. This potential outcome is weighed against the potential benefits: lower funding costs, access to global <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalmarkets.asp\">capital markets</a>, and increased efficiency.\n"]}
