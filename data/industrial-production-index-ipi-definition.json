The FRB\u00a0obtains this data from industry associations and government agencies and aggregates them into an index using the Fisher-ideal formula.\n", "\nWithin the overall IPI,\u00a0there are a number of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/subindex.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sub-indices</a> providing a detailed look at the output of highly specific industries.

It is also important to note that the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/industrial-goods-sector.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">industrial sector</a> makes up a low and falling share of the U.S. economy\u2014less than 20% of GDP as of 2016.\u00a0\n", "\nCapacity utilization is a useful indicator of the strength of demand.

Policymakers could react to those threats with interest rate rises or fiscal austerity. Alternatively, they could let the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/businesscycle.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">business cycle</a> take its course, likely resulting in an eventual recession.\n", "\nBelow is the seasonally-adjusted IPI for the 50 years to October 2017.
