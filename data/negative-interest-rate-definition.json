It's also unclear whether or not negative rates have successfully spread beyond excess cash reserves in the banking system to other parts of the economy.\n", "\nInterest rates tell you how valuable money is today compared to the same amount of money in the future. Positive interest rates imply that there is a time value of money, where money today is worth more than money tomorrow. Forces like inflation, economic growth, and investment spending all contribute to this outlook. A negative interest rate, by contrast, implies that your money will be worth more in the future, not less.\n", "\nMost instances of negative interest rates only apply to bank reserves held by central banks; however, we can ponder the consequences of more widespread negative rates. First, savers would have to pay interest instead of receiving it. By the same token, borrowers would be paid to do so instead of paying their lender. Therefore, it would incentivize many to borrow more and larger sums of money and to forgo saving in favor of consumption or investment. If they did save, they would save their cash in a safe or under the mattress, rather than pay interest to a bank for depositing it. Note that interest rates in the real world are set by the supply and demand for loans (despite central banks setting a target). As a result, the demand for money in-use would grow and quickly restore a positive interest rate.\n", "\nSome central banks have set a negative interest rate policy (NIRP) in order to stimulate economic growth in the financial sector, or else to protect the value of a local currency against exchange-rate increases due to large inflows of foreign investment. Countries including Japan, Switzerland, Sweden, and even the ECB (eurozone) have adopted NIRPs at various points over the past two decades.\n", "\nMonetary policymakers are often afraid of falling into a\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deflationary-spiral.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">deflationary spiral</a>.

This behavior, however, can\u00a0weaken the economy further as a\u00a0lack of spending causes further job losses,\u00a0lowers profits, and prices to drop\u2014all of which reinforces\u00a0people\u2019s fears, giving them even more incentive to hoard. As spending slows even more, prices drop again, creating another incentive for people to wait as\u00a0prices fall further. And so on. When central banks have already lowered interest rates to zero, the NIRP is a way to incentivize corporate borrowing and investment and discourage hoarding of cash.\n", "\n<br/>\n"]}
