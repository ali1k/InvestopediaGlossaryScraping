These types of orders are very common in both stock and forex trading, where intraday swings can equal big gains for traders but are also useful to the average investor with stock, option, or forex trades. There are\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/091813/which-order-use-stoploss-or-stoplimit-orders.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">two similar-sounding order types</a>\u00a0that are slightly different. The first, a stop order, triggers a subsequent market order when the price reaches a designated point. A stop-limit order, on the other hand, triggers a limit order entered when a designated price point is hit.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nTraders who use technical analysis will place stop orders below major <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/movingaverage.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">moving averages</a>, trendlines, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/swinghigh.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">swing highs</a>, swing lows, or other key <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/support.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">support</a> or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/resistance.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">resistance</a> levels.\n", "\nA stop-loss order is essentially an automatic trade order given by an investor to their brokerage to trigger a sale when a certain price level is reached to the downside.

The main risk involved with a stop-loss order is the potential of being stopped out. Stopping out happens when the security unexpectedly hits a stop-loss point, activating the order. The stop could cause a loss on a trade that would have been profitable\u2014or more profitable\u2014had not the sudden stop kicked in. This situation can be particularly galling if prices plunge as they do during a market\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/flash-crash.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">flash crash</a>\u2014plummeting but subsequently recovering. No matter how quick the price rebound, once the stop-loss is triggered, it is triggered.\n", "\nThe strategies described above use the buy stop to protect against bullish movement in a security. Another lesser-known, strategy uses the buy stop to profit from anticipated upward movement in share price.\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technical-analyst.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Technical analysts</a>\u00a0often refer to levels of\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/trading/support-and-resistance-basics/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">resistance and support</a>\u00a0for a stock. The price may go up and down, but it is bracketed at the high end by resistance and by support on the low end. These can also be referred to as a price ceiling and a price floor.\n", "\nSome investors, however, anticipate that a stock that does eventually climb above the line of resistance, in what is known as a\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/breakout.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">breakout</a>, will continue to climb. A buy stop order can be very useful to profit from this phenomenon. The investor will open a buy stop order just above the line of resistance to capture the profits available once a breakout has occurred.\u00a0A\u00a0stop loss order can\u00a0protect against a subsequent decline in\u00a0share price.\n", "\nFor example, if\u00a0on January 5, 2018, AAPL was trading for $175 per share at 1:00 p.m., a\u00a0market order does not guarantee that an investor\u2019s buy or sell price will be <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fill.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">filled</a> at $175. The investor may get a price lower or higher than $175, depending on the time of fill. In the case of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/illiquid.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">illiquid</a> or extremely volatile securities, placing a market order may result in a fill price that significantly differs from $175.\n", "\nOn the other hand, a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/limitorder.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">limit order</a> fills a buy or sell order at a price (or better) specified by the investor. Using our example of\u00a0AAPL above, if an investor places a $177.50 limit on a sell order, and if the price rises to $177.50 or above, their order will be filled. The limit order, in effect, sets the maximum or minimum at which one is willing to buy or sell a particular stock.\n", "\nA <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/buystoporder.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">buy stop order</a> is entered at a stop price above the current market price.\u00a0A sell stop order is entered at a stop price below the current market price. Let\u2019s consider an investor who purchased AAPL for $145. The stock is now trading at $175, however, to limit any losses from a plunge in the stock price in the future, the investor places a sell order at a stop price of $160. If an adverse event occurs\u00a0causing AAPL to fall, the investor\u2019s order will be triggered when prices drop to the $160 mark.\n", "\nA stop order becomes a market order when it reaches the stop price. This means that the order will not necessarily be filled at the stop price. Since it becomes a market order, the executed price may be worse or better than the stop price. The investor above\u00a0may have their shares sold for\u00a0$160, $159.75,\u00a0or $160.03. Stops are not a 100% guarantee of getting the desired entry/exit points.\n", "\nThis can be a disadvantage since, if a stock gaps down, the trader's stop order may be triggered (or filled) at a price significantly lower than expected, depending on the rate at which the price is falling, the volatility of the security,\u00a0or how quickly the order can be executed.\n", "\nFor example, assume that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is trading at $170.00 and an investor wants to buy the stock once it begins to show some serious upward momentum. The investor has put in a stop-limit order to buy with the stop price at $180.00 and the limit price at $185.00. If the price of AAPL moves above the $180.00 stop price, the order is activated and turns into a limit order. As long as the order can be filled under $185.00, which is the limit price, the trade will be filled. If the stock gaps above $185.00, the order will not be filled.\n", "\nBuy stop-limit orders are placed above the market price at the time of the order, while sell stop-limit orders are placed below the market price.\n", "\nUsing this example, one can see how a stop can be used to limit losses and capture profits. The AAPL investor, if their order is filled at stop price of $160, still makes a profit from their investment: $160 - $145 = $15 per share. If the price spiraled down past their initial cost price, they\u00a0will be thankful for the stop.\n", "\nOn the other hand, a stop-loss order could increase the risk of getting out of a position early. For example, let\u2019s assume AAPL drops to $160, but goes on an upward trajectory\u00a0to\u00a0$185. Because the investor\u2019s order is triggered at the $160 mark, they miss out on additional gains that could have been made without the stop order.\n"]}
