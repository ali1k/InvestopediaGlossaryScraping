These securities are not transferable; they cannot be traded on an exchange. UST savings bonds fall into this group.\n", "\nThe function of the U.S. Department of Treasury is the management of money and cash flow for the federal government. It manages the sources and uses of funds. It also works in conjunction with the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalreservebank.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Federal Reserve</a> to develop economic policy.\n", "\nFormally established in 1789 by the First Session of Congress, the institution came into being before the signing of the Declaration of Independence.

If UST securities are trading at 3%, all other fixed-income securities with the same characteristics will trade at some price higher than 3%. It is assumed that there is no borrower with better credit than the United States.\n", "\nMeasures of risk can be based on metrics such as debt ratios and price volatility. A greater leverage or price volatility leads to a greater risk of either the principal and/or the interest not being paid back. Risk is synonymous with return probabilities, as well. Investments that offer the possibility of making greater returns are priced higher, even if that possibility is slim. A higher level of risk associated with an investment means a higher possible return. A downside to owning UST securities is that, due to the lower yield, the interest payments (an investor's income) will be lower.\n"]}
