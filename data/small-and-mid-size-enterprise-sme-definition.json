Each country has its own definition of what constitutes a small and medium-sized enterprise (SME). Certain size criteria must be met and occasionally the industry in which the company operates in is taken into account as well.\n", "\nThough small in size, small and mid-size enterprises (SMEs) play an important role in the economy.
