Some funds hold their equity positions for less than 12 months, meaning their turnover ratios exceed 100%.\n", "\nIf a portfolio's turnover ratio exceeds 100%, it doesn't necessarily mean that every single holding has been replaced, however. The ratio seeks to reflect the proportion of stocks that have changed in one year.\n", "\nThe turnover ratio varies by the type of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutualfund.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mutual fund</a>, its <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investmentobjective.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">investment objective</a>, and/or the portfolio manager's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investmentstyle.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">investing style</a>. For example, a stock market <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indexfund.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">index fund</a> usually will have a low turnover rate since it duplicates a particular index, and the component companies in indexes don't change that often. On the other hand, a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"5\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bondfund.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bond fund</a> will often have high turnover because <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"6\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/active-trading.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">active trading</a> is an inherent quality of bond investments.\n", "\nActively managed mutual funds with a low turnover ratio reflect a buy-and-hold investment strategy; those with high turnover ratios indicate an attempt to profit by a market-timing approach. An aggressive small-cap <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/growthstock.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">growth stock</a> fund will generally experience higher turnover than a large-cap <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valuestock.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">value stock</a> fund.\n", "\nAs a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technicalindicator.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">technical indicator,</a> the turnover ratio itself has no intrinsic value\u2014high turnover ratios are not necessarily \"bad,\" nor are low turnover ratios necessarily \"good.\" But investors should be aware of the consequences of turnover frequency. High turnover often results in increased costs for the fund due to the payment of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spread.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">spreads</a> and commissions when buying and selling stocks; increased costs impact a fund's return overall. Also, the more <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/portfolioturnover.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">portfolio turnover</a> in a fund, the more likely it will generate short-term capital gains, which are taxable at an investor's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/ordinaryincome.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ordinary-income</a> rate.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nA mutual fund's turnover ratio shouldn't be the sole basis of a decision to invest or devest in it. However, it can be useful to see how a particular fund's turnover ratio compares with others of the same type of investment approach. For example, the average turnover ratio for managed mutual funds is 75\u2013115%.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff So a conservative-minded equity investor might target funds with turnover ratios under 50%.\n", "\nIf a fund's turnover ratio is significantly out of line with that of comparable funds, that might be something to note. Say that most funds following a particular index have turnover ratios around 5%, and one fund posted 25% turnover in one year. In this instance, investors might want to ask why: Did a new portfolio manager come in and clean house? Was there some change in the fund objective? Conversely, say that most Pacific Rim equity funds have 75% turnover ratios, but there is one with a ratio of 35%: Is management there asleep at the wheel?\n", "\nThe BNY Mellon Appreciation Fund from Fidelity (DGAGX) has a strong buy-and-hold strategy in mostly blue-chip companies with total market capitalizations of over $5 billion at the time of purchase.
