Whereas correlation explains the strength of the relationship between an independent and dependent variable, R-squared explains to what extent the variance of one variable explains the variance of the second variable.\u00a0So, if the R<sup>2</sup>\u00a0of a model is 0.50, then approximately half of the observed variation can be explained by the model's inputs.\n", "\nIn investing, R-squared is generally\u00a0interpreted as the percentage of a fund or security's movements that can be explained by movements in a benchmark index. For example, an R-squared for a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixed-incomesecurity.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fixed-income security</a> versus a bond index identifies the security's proportion of price movement that is predictable based on a price movement of the index.

This includes taking the data points (observations) of dependent and independent variables and finding the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/line-of-best-fit.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">line of best fit</a>, often from a regression model. From there you would calculate predicted values, subtract actual values and square the results. This yields a list of errors squared, which is then summed and equals the unexplained variance.\n", "\nTo calculate the total variance, you would subtract the average actual value from each of the actual values, square the results and sum them. From there, divide the first sum of errors (explained variance) by the second sum (total variance), subtract the result from one, and you have the R-squared.\u00a0\n", "\nR-squared values range from 0 to 1 and are commonly stated as percentages from 0% to 100%. An R-squared of 100% means that all movements of a security (or another dependent variable) are completely explained by movements in the index (or the independent variable(s) you are interested in).\n", "\nIn investing, a high R-squared, between 85% and 100%, indicates the stock or fund's performance\u00a0moves relatively in line with the index. A fund with a low R-squared, at 70% or less, indicates the security does not generally follow the movements of the index. A higher R-squared value will indicate\u00a0a more useful <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beta.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">beta</a> figure. For example, if a stock or fund has an R-squared value of close to 100%, but has a beta below 1, it is most likely offering higher <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskadjustedreturn.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">risk-adjusted returns</a>.\n", "\nR-Squared only works as intended in a simple linear regression model with one explanatory variable. With a multiple regression made up of several independent variables, the R-Squared must be adjusted. The adjusted R-squared compares the descriptive power of regression models that include diverse numbers of predictors. Every predictor added to a model increases R-squared and never decreases it. Thus, a model with more terms may seem to have a better fit just for the fact that it has more terms, while the adjusted R-squared compensates for the addition of variables and only increases if the new term enhances the model above what would be obtained by\u00a0probability\u00a0and decreases when a predictor enhances the model less than what is predicted by chance. In an\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/overfitting.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">overfitting</a>\u00a0condition, an incorrectly high value of R-squared is obtained, even when the model actually has a decreased ability to predict. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/012615/whats-difference-between-rsquared-and-adjusted-rsquared.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">This is not the case with the adjusted R-squared</a>.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beta.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Beta</a> and R-squared are two related, but different, measures of correlation but beta is a measure of relative riskiness. A mutual fund with a high R-squared correlates highly with a\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/benchmark.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">benchmark</a>. If the beta is also high, it may produce higher returns than the benchmark, particularly in\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bullmarket.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bull markets</a>. R-squared measures how closely each change in the price of an asset is correlated to a benchmark. Beta measures how large those price changes are\u00a0in relation to a benchmark. Used together, R-squared and beta give investors a thorough picture of the performance of asset managers. A beta of exactly 1.0 means that the risk (volatility) of the asset is identical to that of its benchmark. Essentially, R-squared\u00a0is a statistical analysis technique for the practical use and trustworthiness of\u00a0betas of securities.\n", "\nR-squared will give you an estimate of the relationship between movements of a dependent\u00a0variable\u00a0based on an independent variable's movements. It doesn't tell you whether your chosen model is good or bad, nor will it tell you whether the data and predictions are biased.\u00a0A high or low R-square isn't necessarily good or bad, as it doesn't convey the reliability of the model, nor\u00a0whether you've chosen the right regression. You can get\u00a0a low R-squared for a good model, or a high R-square for a poorly fitted model, and vice versa.\n", "\nWhat qualifies as a \u201cgood\u201d R-Squared value will depend on the context. In some fields, such as the social sciences, even a relatively low R-Squared such as 0.5 could be considered relatively strong. In other fields, the standards for a good R-Squared reading can be much higher, such as 0.9 or above. In finance, an R-Squared above 0.7 would generally be seen as showing a high level of correlation, whereas a measure below 0.4 would show a low correlation. This is not a hard rule, however, and will depend on the specific analysis.\n", "\nEssentially, an R-Squared value of 0.9 would indicate that 90% of the variance of the dependent variable being studied is explained by the variance of the independent variable. For instance, if a mutual fund has an R-Squared value of 0.9 relative to its benchmark, that would indicate that 90% of the variance of the fund is explained by the variance of its benchmark index.\n", "\nHere again, it depends on the context. Suppose you are searching for an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indexfund.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">index fund</a> that will track a specific index as closely as possible. In that scenario, you would want the fund\u2019s R-Squared to be as high as possible, since its goal is to match\u2014rather than exceed\u2014the index. If on the other hand you are looking for <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/activemanagement.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">actively-managed funds</a>, a high R-Squared might be seen as a bad sign, indicating that the funds\u2019 managers are not adding sufficient value relative to their benchmarks.\n"]}
