C corporations, the most prevalent of corporations, are also subject to corporate income taxation. The taxing of profits from the business is at both corporate and personal levels, creating a double taxation situation.\n", "\nC-corps can be compared with <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/subchapters.asp\">S corporations</a> and limited liability companies (LLCs), among others, which also separate a company's assets from its owners, but with different legal structures and tax treatment. \u00a0A newer type of organization is the B-corporation (or benefit corporation), which is a for-profit firm but different from C-corps in purpose, accountability, and transparency, but aren\u2019t different in how they\u2019re taxed\n", "\nCorporations pay corporate taxes on earnings before distributing remaining amounts to the shareholders in the form of dividends.\u00a0Individual shareholders are then subject to personal income taxes on the dividends they receive. Although double taxation is an unfavorable outcome, the ability to reinvest profits in the company at a lower corporate tax rate is an advantage.\n", "\nA C corporation is required to hold at least one meeting each year for shareholders and directors. Minutes must be maintained to display transparency in business operations. A C corporation must keep voting records of the company's directors and a list of the owner's names and ownership percentages. Further,\u00a0the business must have company bylaws on the premises of the primary business location. C corporations will\u00a0file annual reports, financial disclosure reports, and financial statements.\n", "\nThe first step in forming a C corporation is to choose and register an unregistered business name. The registrant will file the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/articlesofincorporation.asp\">articles of incorporation</a> with the Secretary of State according to the laws of that state. C corporations offer stock to shareholders, who, upon purchase, become owners of the corporation. The issuance of stock certificates is upon the creation of the business.\u00a0\n", "\nAll C corporations must file Form SS-4 to obtain an employer identification number (EIN). Although requirements vary across jurisdictions, C corporations are required to submit state, income, payroll, unemployment, and disability taxes. In addition to registration and tax requirements, corporations must establish a board of directors to oversee management and the operation of the entire corporation.\u00a0Appointing a\u00a0board of directors seeks to resolve the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/principal-agent-problem.asp\">principal-agent dilemma</a>, in which moral hazard and conflicts of interest arise when an agent works on behalf of a principal.\n", "\nC corporations limit the personal liability of the directors, shareholders, employees, and officers. In this way,\u00a0the legal obligations of the business cannot become a\u00a0personal debt obligation\u00a0of any individual associated with the company. The C corporation continues to exist as owners change and members of management are replaced.\n", "\nA C corporation may have many owners and shareholders. However, it is required to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) upon reaching specific thresholds.\u00a0The ability to offer shares of stock allows the corporation to obtain large amounts of capital which may fund new projects and future expansions.\n"]}
