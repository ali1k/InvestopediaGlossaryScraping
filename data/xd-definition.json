It\u00a0is an alphabetic qualifier that acts as shorthand to tell investors key information about a specific security in a stock quote. Sometimes X\u00a0alone is used to indicate that the stock is trading <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ex-dividend.asp\">ex-dividend</a>. Qualifiers can vary depending on where the stock is quoted, because the various news and market data\u00a0services that provide stock quotes may use different qualifiers. These symbol letters may occur as part of a display on a broker's trading platform, on a charting program or in a timely published report.\n", "\nA dividend is a distribution of part of a company's earnings to the company's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholder.asp\">shareholders</a>. When a stock is trading ex-dividend, the current stockholder has received a recent dividend payment and whoever purchases the stock will not receive the dividend. The stock's price is likely to\u00a0be lower as a result. There are quite a few qualifiers that relate to dividends. For example, <em>j</em>\u00a0indicates that the stock paid a dividend earlier in the year\u00a0but currently does not carry a dividend.\n", "\nYou'll need to look at two important dates to determine who should get a dividend\u2014the\u00a0\"ex-date\" (or XD) and the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/recorddate.asp\">record date</a>.\n", "\nAn investor must be on the company's books as a shareholder to receive a\u00a0dividend. Once the company sets the record date, the ex-dividend date is set. The ex-dividend date for stocks is usually set\u00a0one business day before\u00a0the record date. An investor who purchased shares before the ex-dividend date will\u00a0get the upcoming dividend.\u00a0If a purchase took place on or after\u00a0the ex-dividend date, then the seller gets the dividend.\n", "\nCompanies also use the record date to determine to whom to send financial reports, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proxystatement.asp\">proxy statements</a> and other required information.\n", "\nIf a\u00a0dividend is 25 percent\u00a0or more of the stock's value, then special rules will apply to determine\u00a0the ex-dividend date.\u00a0When this happens, the ex-dividend date is deferred until one business day after the dividend is paid.\u00a0\u00a0\n", "\nSometimes a company pays a dividend in the form of stock rather than cash\u2014either as\u00a0additional shares in the company or in a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/subsidiary.asp\">subsidiary</a> that is being spun off.
