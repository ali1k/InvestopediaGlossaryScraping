People will often think about investment income as separate from money they earned in other ways, which distorts their <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mentalaccounting.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mental accounting</a>. Because that money is incorrectly considered somehow \"extra\" or \"separate\" from money earned in other ways, investors will invest it with a much higher <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risktolerance.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">risk tolerance</a> than they would otherwise, thereby skewing their investment decisions.\n", "\nRichard H. Thaler and Eric J. Johnson of the Cornell University Johnson Graduate School of Management first defined the \u201chouse money effect,\u201d borrowing the term from casinos. The term makes reference to a gambler who takes winnings from previous bets and uses some or all of them in subsequent bets.\n", "\nThe house money effect suggests, for example, that individuals tend to buy higher-risk stocks, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bonds</a> or other asset classes after profitable trades.\u00a0For example, after earning a short-term profit from a stock with a beta of 1.5, it\u2019s not uncommon for an investor to next trade a stock with a beta of 2 or more. This is because the recent successful outcome in trading the first stock with above-average risk temporarily lowers the investor\u2019s risk tolerance. Thus, this investor next seeks even more risk.\n", "\nWindfall trades may also bring on the house money effect. Say an investor more than doubles her profit on a longer-term trade held for four months. Instead of next taking on a less-risky trade or cashing out some proceeds to preserve her profit, the house money effect suggests she may next take on another risky trade, not fearing a drawdown as long as some of her original gain is preserved.\n", "\nLonger-term investors sometimes suffer a similar fate. Say an investor in a growth-oriented <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutualfund.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mutual fund</a> earns more than 30% in a year\u2019s time, largely driven by very strong market conditions. Keep in mind, the average stock gain tends to be roughly 6% to 8% a year. Now say this investor leaves the growth-oriented fund at year\u2019s end to next invest in an aggressive long-short hedge fund. This may be an example of the house money effect temporarily increasing the investor\u2019s risk tolerance.\n", "\nFor longer-term investors, one of two courses of action tend to be preferable to the house money effect: Either staying the course and maintaining a steady <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risktolerance.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">risk tolerance</a>, or becoming slightly more conservative after big windfalls.\n", "\nOf note, the house money effect also carries over to company stock options. In the dot-com boom, some employees refused to exercise their stock options over time, believing it was better to keep them and let them triple, then triple again. This strategy significantly stung workers in 2000, when some paper millionaires lost it all.\n", "\nA technical analyst tends to draw a distinction between the house money effect and the concept of \u201cletting winners ride.\u201d To the contrary, one way technical traders manage risk is by cashing out half the value of a trade after meeting an initial price target. Then, technical traders tend to move up their stop before giving the second half of the trade a chance to meet a secondary price target.\n", "\nMany technical traders utilize some version of this practice, in an effort to continue to profit from the minority of trades that continue to move up and up, which still holds to the spirit of letting winners ride while not falling victim to the house money effect. The difference between these two concepts is actually one of calculation. Letting winners ride in a mathematically calculated <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/09/determine-position-size.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">position-size strategy</a> is an excellent way of compounding gains. Some traders have, in the past, documented how such strategies were <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/08/turtle-trading.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">instrumental in their success</a>.\n"]}
