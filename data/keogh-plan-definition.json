A Keogh plan can be set up as either a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/definedbenefitpensionplan.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">defined-benefit</a> or a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/definedcontributionplan.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">defined-contribution plan</a>, although most plans are set as the latter. Contributions are generally tax-deductible up to a certain percentage of annual income, with applicable absolute limits in U.S. dollar terms, which the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) can change\u00a0from year to year.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nKeogh plans are retirement plans for self-employed people and unincorporated businesses, such as sole proprietorships and partnerships. If an individual is an independent contractor, they cannot set up and use a Keogh plan for retirement.\n", "\nThe IRS refers to Keogh plans as qualified plans, and they come in two types: defined-contribution\u00a0plans, which include profit-sharing plans and money purchase plans, and defined-benefit plans, also known as HR(10) plans.\u00a0Keogh plans can invest in the same set of securities as 401(k)s and IRAs, including stocks, bonds, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/certificateofdeposit.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">certificates of deposit</a> (CDs),\u00a0and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/annuity.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">annuities</a>.\n", "\nKeogh plans can be set up as qualified defined-contribution plans, in which the contributions are made on a regular basis up to a limit. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profitsharingplan.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Profit-sharing plans</a>\u00a0are one of the two types of Keogh plans that allow a business to contribute up to 100% of compensation, or $58,000 as of 2021, according to the IRS.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff A business does not have to generate profits to set aside money for this type of plan.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/moneypurchasepensionplan.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Money purchase plans</a> are less flexible compared to profit-sharing plans and require a business to contribute a fixed percentage of its income every year that is specified in plan documents. If a business alters its fixed percentage, it may face penalties. The <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/choosing-a-retirement-plan-money-purchase-plan\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">contribution limit</a> for 2021\u00a0for money purchase plans is set at 25% of annual compensation or $58,000 ($57,000 for 2020), whichever is lower.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nQualified defined-benefit plans state the annual benefits to be received at retirement, and these benefits are typically based on salary and years of employment. Contributions towards defined-benefit Keogh plans are based on stated benefits and other factors, such as age and expected returns on plan assets.

Eugene Keogh.
