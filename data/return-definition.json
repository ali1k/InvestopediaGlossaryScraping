A return can also be expressed as a percentage derived from the ratio of profit to investment. Returns can also be presented as net results (after fees, taxes, and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">inflation</a>) or gross returns that do not account for anything but the price change. It even includes a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/401kplan.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">401(k)</a> investment.\n", "\nPrudent investors know that\u00a0a\u00a0precise definition of return is situational and dependent on\u00a0the financial data input to measure it. An omnibus term like profit could mean gross, operating, net, before tax, or after tax. An omnibus term like investment could mean selected,\u00a0average, or total assets.\n", "\nA <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/holdingperiodreturn-yield.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">holding period return</a> is an investment's\u00a0return\u00a0over the time it is owned by a particular investor. Holding period return may be expressed nominally or as a percentage. When expressed as a percentage, the term often used is <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rateofreturn.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">rate of return</a> (RoR).\n", "\nFor example, the return earned during the periodic interval of a month is a monthly return and of a year is an annual return. Often, people are interested in the annual return of an investment, or year-on-year (YoY) return, which calculates the price change from today to that of the same date one year ago.\n", "\nReturns over periodic intervals of different lengths can only be compared when they have been converted to same length intervals. It is customary to compare returns earned during year-long intervals. The process of converting shorter or longer return intervals to annual returns is called annualization.\n", "\nA <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nominal-rate-of-return.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">nominal return</a> is the net profit or loss of an investment expressed in nominal terms. It can be calculated by figuring the change in the value of the investment over a stated time period plus any distributions minus any outlays.\n", "\nDistributions received by an investor depend on the type of investment or venture but may include <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">dividends</a>, interest, rents, rights, benefits, or other cash-flows received by an investor. Outlays paid by an investor depend on the type of investment or venture but may include taxes, costs, fees, or expenditures\u00a0paid by an investor to acquire, maintain, and sell an investment.\u00a0\n", "\nFor example, assume an investor buys $1,000 worth of publicly traded stock, receives no distributions, pays no outlays, and sells the stock two years later for $1,200. The nominal return in dollars\u00a0is $1,200 - $1,000 = $200.\n", "\nA real rate of return is adjusted for changes in prices due to inflation or other external factors. This method expresses the\u00a0nominal rate of return\u00a0in real terms, which keeps the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/purchasingpower.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">purchasing power</a>\u00a0of a given level of capital constant over time.\n", "\nAdjusting the nominal return to compensate for factors such as inflation allows you to determine how much of your nominal return is real return. Knowing the real rate of return of an investment is very important before investing your money. That\u2019s because inflation can reduce the value as time goes on, just as taxes also chip away at it.\n", "\nInvestors should also consider whether the risk involved with a certain investment is something they can tolerate given the real rate of return. Expressing rates of return in real values rather than nominal values, particularly during periods of high inflation, offers a clearer picture of an investment's value.\n", "\nReturn ratios\u00a0are a subset of\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/ratioanalysis.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">financial ratios</a>\u00a0that\u00a0measure how effectively an investment is being managed. They help\u00a0to evaluate if the highest possible return is being generated on an investment.\u00a0In general, return ratios\u00a0compare the tools available to generate profit, such as the investment in assets or\u00a0equity to net income.\n", "\nReturn ratios make this comparison by dividing selected or total assets or equity into net income. The result is a\u00a0percentage of return per dollar invested\u00a0that\u00a0can be\u00a0used to evaluate the strength of the investment by\u00a0comparing it\u00a0to\u00a0benchmarks like the return ratios of similar investments,\u00a0companies,\u00a0industries, or markets.\u00a0For instance, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnofcapital.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">return of capital</a> (ROC) means the recovery of the original investment.\n", "\nA percentage return is a return expressed as a percentage.

ROI is the return per dollar invested. ROI is calculated by dividing the dollar return by the initial dollar investment. This ratio is multiplied by 100 to get a percentage. Assuming a $200 return on a $1,000 investment, the percentage return or ROI = ($200 / $1,000) x 100 = 20%.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnonequity.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Return on equity</a> (ROE) is a profitability ratio calculated as net income divided by average shareholder's equity that measures how much net income is generated per dollar of stock investment.\u00a0If a company makes $10,000 in net income for the year\u00a0and the average equity capital of the company over the same time period is $100,000, the ROE\u00a0is 10%.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnonassets.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Return on assets</a> (ROA) is a profitability ratio calculated as net income divided by average total assets that measures how much net profit is generated for each dollar invested in assets.\u00a0It determines financial leverage and whether enough is earned from asset use to cover the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/costofcapital.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cost of capital</a>.
