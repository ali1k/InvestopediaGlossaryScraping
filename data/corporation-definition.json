Some refer to it as a\u00a0\"legal person.\"\n", "\nAll kinds of businesses around the world use corporations. While its exact legal status varies somewhat from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, a corporation's\u00a0most important aspect\u00a0is\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/limitedliability.asp\">limited liability</a>. This means that <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholder.asp\">shareholders</a> may take part in the profits\u00a0through dividends and stock appreciation\u00a0but are not personally liable for the company's debts.\n", "\nAlmost all well-known businesses are corporations, including Microsoft Corporation, the Coca-Cola Company, and Toyota Motor Corporation. Some corporations do business under their names and also under business names, such as Alphabet Inc., which famously does business as Google.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nA corporation is created when it is <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incorporate.asp\">incorporated</a> by a group of shareholders who have ownership of the corporation, represented by their holding of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commonstock.asp\">common stock</a>, to pursue a common goal. A corporation's goals can be for-profit or not, as with charities. However, the vast majority of corporations aim to provide\u00a0a return for its shareholders. Shareholders, as owners of a percentage of the corporation, are only responsible for the payment of their shares to the company's treasury upon issuance.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/closed-corporation.asp\">A corporation can have a single shareholder or several</a>. With publicly traded corporations, there are often thousands of shareholders. Corporations are created and regulated under corporate laws in their jurisdictions of residence.\n", "\nThe process for forming a corporation varies according to the state you do business in and the state you live in. For the most part, you'll need to file <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/articlesofincorporation.asp\">articles of incorporation</a> with the state and then issue stock to the company's shareholders.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"14\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff The shareholders will elect the board of directors in an annual meeting.\n", "\nThe shareholders, which generally\u00a0receive\u00a0one vote per share, annually elect a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/boardofdirectors.asp\">board of directors</a> that appoints and oversees the management of the corporation's day-to-day activities. The board of directors executes the corporation's business plan and must take all the means to do so. Although the members of the board are not generally\u00a0responsible for the corporation's debts, they owe a duty of care to the corporation and can incur personal liabilities if they neglect this duty. Some tax statutes also provide for the personal liabilities of the board of directors.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"15\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nWhen the corporation has reached its objectives, its legal life can be terminated using a process called liquidation or winding up. Essentially, a company appoints a liquidator who sells the corporation's assets, then the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/09/corporate-liquidation-unpaid-taxes-wages.asp\">company pays any creditors</a> and gives any remaining assets to the shareholders.\n", "\nThe liquidation process can be voluntary or involuntary. If it is involuntary, the creditors of an insolvent corporation usually trigger it, and this may lead to the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/01/120501.asp\">bankruptcy of the corporation</a>.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"16\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nA corporation is a single entity which may be comprised of individuals or a company, but is separate from its owners. Among the most important features of a corporation is limited liability, which means that its owners can participate in the share of profits, but not the corporation\u2019s liabilities. Along with limited liability, corporations possess the ability to own assets, enter contracts, sue or be sued, and borrow money.\n", "\nForming a corporation varies according to both the state that one resides and live in and the state that the business is conducted in. Generally speaking, articles of incorporation will be filed with the state, followed by the issuance of stock to the corporation's shareholders. After this point, in an annual meeting, the shareholders will elect a board of directors whose duties include executing the company\u2019s business plan and overseeing the day-to-day operations of the business.\n", "\nWhile both a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation offer legal advantages and protections to their owners, each have distinct differences. First, forming an LLC typically involves a more straightforward process. For corporations, it is more complex and lengthy. Additionally, in most cases, an LLC is governed by an operating agreement which sets out the roles and responsibilities of its members. Corporations, on the other hand, elect a board of directors, conduct annual meetings, publish financial statements, and adopt bylaws. Different tax structures apply to LLCs compared to corporations, based on different state laws.\n"]}
