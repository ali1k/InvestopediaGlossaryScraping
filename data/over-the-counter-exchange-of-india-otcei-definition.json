There is no central place of exchange, and all trading occurs through electronic networks.\n", "\nThe OTCEI is based in Mumbai, India, and operates solely over a computer network. The exchange is recognized by India's Securities Contract Regulation Act, meaning all <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/listed.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">listed</a> stocks on the OTCEI benefit equally as other listed <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">securities</a> on other exchanges in India.\n", "\nThe exchange was established in 1990 to provide investors and companies with an additional way to trade and issue securities. It arose primarily from small companies in India finding it difficult to raise <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">capital</a> through mainstream national stock <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockmarket.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">exchanges</a> because they could not fulfill the stringent requirements to be listed on them.\n", "\nThe OTCEI has rules that are not as rigid as the national exchanges, allowing small companies to gain access to the capital they need to grow. The objective is that once they grow to a certain level and are able to meet the requirements to be listed on the national <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/04/092404.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">stock exchanges</a>, they will make the switch over and leave the OTCEI behind.\n", "\nThanks to advances in technology that have yielded improvements in electronic trading platforms, the differences between traditional exchanges and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otc.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">over-the-counter</a> (OTC) networks are no longer vast, greatly benefiting the small- and medium-sized companies.\n", "\nThe OTCEI has some special features that make it a unique exchange in India as well as a growth catalyst for small- to medium-sized companies. The following are some of its unique features:\n", "\nThe OTCEI makes it easier for small- to mid-cap sized companies to be listed, although there are still some requirements that companies must meet before being allowed to be listed.\n", "\nStipulations include acquiring sponsorship from members of the OTCEI and having two <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketmaker.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">market makers</a>. In addition, once a company is listed, it cannot be <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/delisting.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">delisted</a> for at least three years, and a certain percentage of issued equity capital needs to be kept by promoters for a minimum of three years. This percentage is 20%.\n", "\nThe transactions on the OTCEI revolve around the dealers. Dealers operate in a few capacities, the two most important being as a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/broker.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">broker</a> and as a market maker. As a broker, the dealer transacts on behalf of buyers and sellers. As a market maker, the dealer has to ensure the availability of the shares for transaction purposes as well as to ensure that the price remains reasonable through <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/law-of-supply-demand.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">supply and demand</a> levels.\n", "\nIn addition to the dealers, the OTCEI also has custodians. The <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/custodian.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">custodian</a>, or settler, is the individual that performs the multitude of administrative tasks necessary for the proper functioning of the OTCEI. These tasks include validating and storing documents as well as facilitating daily <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/clearing.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">clearing</a> transactions.\n", "\nFinally, the last group of players consists of the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/registrar.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">registrars</a> and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/transferagent.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">transfer agents</a>, who are responsible for making sure the correct transfer and allotment of shares take place.\n"]}
