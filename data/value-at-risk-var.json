This metric is most commonly used by investment and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commercialbank.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">commercial banks</a> to determine the extent and occurrence ratio of potential losses in their institutional portfolios.\n", "\nRisk managers use\u00a0VaR\u00a0to measure and control the level of risk exposure. One can apply\u00a0VaR <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/033115/how-can-you-calculate-value-risk-var-excel.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">calculations</a> to specific positions or whole portfolios or to measure firm-wide risk exposure.\n", "\nVaR\u00a0modeling determines the potential for loss in the entity being assessed\u00a0and the probability of occurrence for the defined loss. One measures VaR\u00a0by assessing the amount of potential loss, the probability of occurrence for the amount of loss, and the timeframe.\n", "\nFor example, a financial firm may determine an asset has a 3%\u00a0one-month VaR of 2%, representing a 3%\u00a0chance of the asset declining in value by 2%\u00a0during the one-month time frame. The conversion of the 3%\u00a0chance of occurrence to a daily ratio places the odds of a 2%\u00a0loss at one day per month.\n", "\nUsing a firm-wide VaR assessment allows for the determination of the cumulative risks from aggregated positions held by different trading desks and departments within the institution. Using the data provided by VaR modeling, financial institutions can determine whether they have sufficient capital reserves in place to cover losses or whether higher-than-acceptable risks require them to reduce\u00a0concentrated holdings.\n", "\nThere is no standard protocol for the statistics used to determine asset, portfolio or firm-wide risk. For example, statistics pulled arbitrarily from a period of low <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volatility.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">volatility</a> may understate the potential for risk events to occur\u00a0and the magnitude of those events. Risk may be further understated using normal distribution probabilities, which rarely account for extreme or black-swan events.\n", "\nThe assessment of potential loss represents the lowest amount of risk in a range of outcomes. For example, a VaR determination of 95%\u00a0with 20%\u00a0asset risk represents an expectation of losing at least 20% one of every 20 days on average. In this calculation, a loss of 50%\u00a0still validates the risk assessment.\n", "\nThe <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/09/financial-crisis-review.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">financial crisis of 2008</a>\u00a0that exposed these problems as relatively benign VaR calculations understated the potential occurrence of risk events posed by portfolios of subprime mortgages. Risk magnitude was also underestimated, which resulted in extreme leverage ratios within subprime portfolios. As a result, the underestimations of occurrence and risk magnitude left institutions unable to cover billions of dollars in losses as subprime mortgage values collapsed.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n"]}
