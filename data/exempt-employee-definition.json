Exempt employees do not receive overtime pay, nor do they qualify for the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/minimum_wage.asp\">minimum wage</a>. When an employee is exempt, it primarily means that they are exempt from receiving overtime pay. Exempt employees stand in contrast to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nonexempt-employee.asp\">nonexempt employees</a>.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\"></span>\n", "\nIn any workplace there are two types of employees: exempt and nonexempt. The former are classified as employees who are <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/022615/can-family-survive-us-minimum-wage.asp\">exempt from minimum wage</a> and overtime pay requirements.

Exempt employees often receive year-end bonuses to compensate for the type of work they do, as well as for any overtime work.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\"></span>\n", "\nRequirements differ from state to state, but the FLSA classifies exempt employees as any job that falls into these categories:<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\"></span>\n", "\nThese classifications are quite broad, which they are intended to be, as they encompass a variety of jobs in many different industries. As of Jan. 1, 2020, the FLSA stipulates that employees in the above categories are exempt if they are paid by salary as opposed to hourly and if they earn a minimum of $684 per week or $35,568 annually. This is an increase from $455 per week or $23,660 annually.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\"></span>\n", "\nIn addition to the main categories of exempt employees, other categories of employees may possibly be considered exempt from receiving overtime pay. These include farm workers; motion picture theater employees; certain employees of nonmetropolitan broadcast stations; taxi drivers; employees of railroads, motor carriers, and American vessels; and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commission.asp\">commissioned sales</a> employees of retail or service entities.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\"></span>\n", "\nThe exempt employee category was created by the FLSA, passed in 1938. The watershed labor law protects workers against unfair pay practices and work regulations. The law has been greatly changed over the last 80 years, but it is still one of the most important labor laws in the history of the United States, setting regulations for a wide array of employee- and employer-related issues.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\"></span>\n", "\nThe FLSA specifies the conditions when workers are to be paid and when they are not expected to be paid. For instance, when working excess hours an exempt employee does not receive overtime or time and a half. Time and a half is 1.5 times the hourly rate of the employee\u2014the minimum an employer has to pay for overtime. The act marks overtime as any hours that exceed\u00a040 hours in a seven-day workweek.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\"></span>\n", "\nThe pros of being an exempt employee start with the security of knowing that you have a steady paycheck. Also, exempt employees tend to earn more than hourly ones and have access to such extras as retirement benefits, including individual retirement accounts (IRAs), 401(k) plans, and pensions; bonuses; employer-sponsored healthcare plans; and paid vacation time and sick days.\n", "\nThe downside comes largely in not being eligible for overtime. Depending on the mindset of your employer, you could find yourself working long hours to fulfill an overloaded work portfolio without any recourse for additional reimbursement or reducing the stress brought on by the long hours.
