In a market, these forces create pricing signals which result from the fluctuation of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/law-of-supply-demand.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">supply and demand</a> for a given product or service. Market dynamics can impact any industry or government policy.\n", "\nThere are dynamic market forces other than price, demand, and supply. Human emotions also drive decisions, influence the market, and create price signals.\n", "\nMarket dynamics are the factors that change the supply and demand curves. They form the basis of many economic models and theories. Because market dynamics impact the supply and demand curves, policymakers aim to determine the best way to use various financial tools to stimulate or cool down an economy. Is it better to raise or lower taxes, increase wages or slow down wage growth, do neither, or do both? How will these adjustments affect supply and demand and the general direction of the economy?\n", "\nThere are two primary economic approaches when it comes to changing the supply or demand in an economy with the ultimate goal of impacting the economy positively. One has a basis on supply-side theory and the other has a demand-side base.\n", "\nSupply-side economics, also known as \"<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reaganomics.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Reaganomics</a>,\" or \"trickle-down economics\" is a policy made famous by the 40th U.S. President, Ronald Reagan, based on the theory that more significant tax cuts for investors, corporations, and entrepreneurs provide incentives\u00a0for investors to supply more goods to an economy, which results in other added benefits that trickle down to the rest of the economy.\n", "\nThe\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/supply-sidetheory.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">supply-side theory</a>\u00a0has three pillars which are tax policy, regulatory policy, and\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monetarypolicy.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">monetary policy</a>. However, the overall concept is that production, or the supply of goods and services, is most important in determining economic growth. The supply-side theory contrasts with <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/keynesianeconomics.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Keynesian theory</a>,\u00a0which considers that demand for products and services can drop and, in that case, the government should intervene with fiscal and monetary stimuli.\n", "\nThe opposite of supply-side economics is demand-side economics, which argues that the creation of effective\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economicgrowth.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">economic growth</a>\u00a0comes from the high\u00a0demand\u00a0for products and services. If there is a high demand for goods and services,\u00a0consumer spending\u00a0grows, and businesses can expand and employ additional workers. Higher levels of employment further stimulate\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aggregatedemand.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">aggregate demand</a>\u00a0and economic growth.\n", "\nDemand-side economists believe tax cuts in general can stimulate aggregate demand and move an economy that has significant unemployment back towards a full employment scenario. However, tax cuts specifically for corporations and the wealthy may not end up stimulating the economy. In this case, the additional funds may not increase the demand for goods or services. Instead, it could be argued that the incremental income generated may go back into stock buybacks that boost the market value of the stock or to executive benefits but do not end up materially stimulating the economy.\n", "\nDemand-side economists argue that increased government spending will help to grow the economy by spurring additional employment opportunities.\u00a0They use the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/great_depression.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Great Depression</a>\u00a0of the 1930s as evidence that increased government spending stimulates growth at a greater rate than do tax cuts.\n", "\nEconomic models and theories attempt to account for market dynamics in a way that captures as many relevant variables as possible. However, not all variables are easily quantifiable.\n", "\nModels of markets for physical goods or services with relatively straightforward dynamics are,\u00a0for the most part, efficient, and\u00a0participants in these markets are assumed to make <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rational-behavior.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">rational decisions</a>. However, in financial markets, the human element of emotion creates a chaotic and difficult-to-quantify effect\u00a0that always results in increased <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volatility.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">volatility</a>.\n", "\nIn financial markets, some, but not all, financial\u00a0services professionals are knowledgeable about how markets work.

They also work to fully understand their client's needs, goals, time horizons, and ability to withstand investment risks.\n", "\nUnfortunately, some market participants are not professionals\u00a0and possess\u00a0limited knowledge of the markets and the various events that can impact the market.\n", "\nThis segment of nonprofessionals includes small-to-intermediate traders who seek to \u201cget-rich-quick,\u201d scam artists, driven by personal greed, and investors who attempt to manage their investments rather than seek professional advice. Some in this category of experts are self-proclaimed professionals who are, at times, dishonest.\n", "\nCompetent and professional traders determine entry and exit points of any investment or trade using\u00a0proven <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quantitativeanalysis.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">quantitative models or techniques</a>. They define the appropriate plan of action and follow it exactly. Through the practice of strict money management, the execution of trades happens without deviating from the well thought out, predetermined plan. Emotion seldom influences the decision-making process of these traders.\n", "\nConversely, for the novice investor or trader, emotion frequently plays a role in their decision-making process. After the execution of a trade, if it becomes profitable, greed may influence their next move.\n", "\nThese traders will ignore indicators and, at times, not take profits turning a winning trade into a losing one. Fear is another emotion that can drive the decisions of these investors. They may fail to exit a trade at a predetermined <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stop-lossorder.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">stop loss</a>. These are examples of irrational emotional behavior that is difficult to capture in economic models, thus difficult to know how market dynamics will impact supply and demand.\n", "\nConsumer demand can at times be a powerful market dynamic.
