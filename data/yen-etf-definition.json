Unpredictable natural disasters can also have a big impact, an example being the Fukushima disaster in 2011, which caused a surge in the value of the yen, followed by a\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/recession.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">recession.</a>\n", "\nLately, a handful of analysts have even questioned the Japanese yen\u2019s safe-haven status, pointing to its <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trade_deficit.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">trade deficits</a>, local <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetmanagement.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">asset managers</a> buying higher-yielding foreign assets, and Japanese companies running out of decent options to deploy capital at home. The yen has also lost some of its luster as a popular carry trade as low-interest rates become commonplace among major economies.\n", "\nThese observations serve as a reminder that forex\u00a0trading is not a market for the unprepared.
