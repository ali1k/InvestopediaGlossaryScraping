In a quote-driven market, also known as a price-driven market, dealers fill orders from their own inventory or by matching them with other orders. A quote-driven market is the opposite of an order-driven market, which displays individual investors' bid and ask prices and the number of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shares.asp\">shares</a> they want to trade.\n", "\nQuote-driven markets are most commonly found in markets for\u00a0bonds, currencies, and commodities. Quote-driven markets are also known as a dealers market because all\u00a0trades are\u00a0executed through\u00a0dealers. The dealers, working with investment banks, commercial banks, and broker-dealers, provide quotes for different instruments and all customers need to trade through them at the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quoted-price.asp\">quoted prices</a>.\n", "\nSome people may also refer\u00a0to quote-driven markets\u00a0as a dealer- or price-driven market. The following are some of the key points about the quote-driven market.\n", "\nTraders may\u00a0either accept the prices quoted by the dealers or try to\u00a0negotiate better\u00a0prices either themselves or through their broker or agent.\u00a0In a pure quote-driven market, all traders must trade\u00a0through\u00a0dealers; however, dealers may also\u00a0trade among themselves through\u00a0inter-dealer brokers. In a quote-driven market, dealers supply all the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp\">liquidity</a> in the market.\n", "\nDealers may choose not to execute a trade for a specific client. This is often done because some\u00a0dealers specialize in certain types of\u00a0clients,\u00a0such as retail or institutional.\n", "\nOrder execution is not guaranteed in an order-driven market, but it is guaranteed in a quote-driven market because market makers are required to meet the bid and ask prices they quote. A quote-driven market is more liquid than an order-driven market but lacks transparency. A hybrid market combines aspects\u00a0of both quote-driven and order-driven markets. The NYSE and Nasdaq are both considered hybrid markets.\n", "\nIn an order-driven market,\u00a0orders of both buyers and sellers are shown, displaying\u00a0the price at which each is\u00a0willing to buy or sell a stock and the quantity of the stock that they are willing to buy or sell at that price. An order-driven market is transparent in the sense that it clearly shows all of the market orders and the\u00a0prices at which\u00a0people are willing to buy\u00a0or sell, which is not the\u00a0case for\u00a0quote driven-markets. Furthermore, a\u00a0quote-driven market is more liquid due to the presence of market makers, but this is not the case for\u00a0order-driven markets.\n"]}
