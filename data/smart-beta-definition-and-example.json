It seeks the best construction of an optimally diversified portfolio. In effect, smart beta is a combination of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/efficientmarkethypothesis.asp\">efficient-market\u00a0hypothesis</a> and value investing. The smart beta investment approach applies to popular asset classes, such as equities, fixed income, commodities and multi-asset classes. Economist <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/harrymarkowitz.asp\">Harry Markowitz</a> first theorized smart Beta via his work on modern portfolio theory.\n", "\nSmart beta defines a set of investment strategies that emphasize the use of alternative index construction rules to traditional <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp\">market capitalization</a>-based indices. Smart beta emphasizes capturing investment factors or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inefficientmarket.asp\">market inefficiencies</a> in a rules-based and transparent way. The increased popularity of smart beta is linked to a desire for portfolio risk management and diversification along factor dimensions, as well as seeking to enhance <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskadjustedreturn.asp\">risk-adjusted returns</a> above cap-weighted indices.\n", "\nSmart beta strategies seek to passively follow indices, while also considering alternative weighting schemes such as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volatility.asp\">volatility</a>, liquidity, quality, value, size and momentum. That's because smart beta strategies are implemented like typical index strategies in that the index rules are set and transparent. These funds don\u2019t track standard indices, such as the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sp500.asp\">S&amp;P 500</a> or the Nasdaq 100 Index, but instead, focus on areas of the market that offer an opportunity for exploitation.\n", "\nThere is no single approach to developing a smart beta investment strategy, as the goals for investors can be different based on their needs, though some managers are prescriptive in identifying smart beta ideas that are value-creating and economically intuitive. Equity smart beta seeks to address inefficiencies created by market-capitalization-weighted <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/benchmark.asp\">benchmarks</a>. Funds may take a thematic approach to manage this risk by focusing on mispricing created by investors seeking short-term gains, for example.\n", "\nManagers may also choose to create or follow an index that weights investments according to fundamentals, such as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earnings.asp\">earnings</a> or book value, rather than market capitalization.\n", "\nAlternatively, managers may use a risk-weighted approach to smart beta that involves the establishment of an index based upon assumptions of future volatility.\u00a0For instance, this may involve an analysis of historical performance and the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/correlation.asp\">correlation</a> between an investment's risk relative to its return. The manager must evaluate how many assumptions he or she is willing to build into the index and can approach the index by assuming a combination of different correlations.\n", "\nAlthough smart beta funds typically attract higher fees than their vanilla counterparts, they continue to remain popular with investors. As of February 2019, 77 new <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smart-beta-etf.asp\">smart-beta exchange-traded funds</a> (ETFs) launched, which accounts for roughly a third of all ETFs that came to market in the past year, according to FactSet data <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www.etf.com/sections/features-and-news/whats-working-smart-beta-etfs?nopaging=1\">as reported by ETF.com</a>. Smart beta funds also attracted a more significant increase in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aum.asp\">assets under management</a> (AUM) over the period, growing at 10.9% compared to 4.3% for vanilla funds.
