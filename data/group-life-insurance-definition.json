It is fairly inexpensive, may even be free, and is pretty common nationwide. It has a relatively low coverage amount and is typically offered as a piece of a larger employer or membership benefit package.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/122315/group-term-life-insurance-what-you-need-know.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Group life insurance is a single contract for life insurance coverage that extends to a group of people</a>. By purchasing group life insurance policy coverage through an insurance provider on a wholesale basis for its members, companies are able to secure costs for each individual employee that are much lower than if they were to purchase an individual policy.\n", "\nThose receiving group life insurance coverage may not have to pay anything out of pocket for policy benefits. People who choose to take more-advanced coverage alongside it may elect to have their portion of the premium payment deducted from their paycheck. Just as with regular insurance policies, insured parties are required to list one or more <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beneficiary.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">beneficiaries</a> before the policy comes into effect. Beneficiaries can be changed at any point during the coverage period.\n", "\nThe typical group policy is for <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/termlife.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">term life insurance</a>, often renewable each year with a company\u2019s open-enrollment process. This is in contrast to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wholelife.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">whole life insurance</a>, which provides coverage no matter when you die. Whole life insurance policies are permanent, have higher premiums and death benefits, and constitute the most popular type of life insurance.\n", "\nWith group life insurance, the employer or organization purchasing the policy for its staff or members retains the master contract. Employees who elect coverage through the group policy usually receive a certificate of coverage, which is needed to provide to a subsequent insurance company in the event that an individual leaves the company or organization and terminates their coverage.\n", "\nGroup life insurance policies generally come with certain conditions. Some organizations require group members to participate for a minimum amount of time before they are granted coverage. For instance, an employee may need to pass a probationary period before being allowed to take part in employee health and life insurance benefits.\n", "\nCoverage is normally only valid for as long as a member is part of the group. Once the member leaves, whether through resignation or firing, the coverage ends.\n", "\nThe biggest appeal group life insurance has for employees is its value for money. Group members typically pay very little, if anything at all. Any premiums are drawn directly from their weekly or monthly gross earnings. Qualifying for group policies is easy, with coverage guaranteed to all group members. Unlike with individual policies, group insurance doesn\u2019t require a medical exam.\n", "\nHowever, low cost and convenience aren\u2019t everything. Group life insurance generally comes with only basic coverage, which means <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/022014/your-employerprovided-life-insurance-coverage-enough.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">it may not fulfill the needs of policyholders</a>. Typical amounts are $20,000, $50,000, or one or two times the insured\u2019s annual salary. That\u2019s why experts say it should be treated as a perk and supplemented with a separate individual policy, rather than being seen as sufficient standalone coverage.\n", "\nAnother drawback is that the employer controls the policy, which means your premiums can increase based on decisions that your employer makes. If an organization opts to terminate group life insurance\u2014or a person decides to switch jobs\u2014coverage usually stops. However, the former employee does have an option to continue coverage at the individual level. This means the policy is converted from a group life policy to an individual one, which comes with higher premiums. While many people may not want the greater cost, those who are otherwise uninsurable will benefit from the conversion, as a medical exam still would not be required.\n", "\nSome organizations allow group members to purchase more coverage than basic life insurance. That extra voluntary coverage may make financial sense because even the added premium will still be based on the less-expensive group rate. That part of the policy also may be <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/portable-benefits.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">portable</a> between jobs. Unlike the basic group policy, additional coverage often requires applicants to answer a medical questionnaire, but it may not require an actual physical exam. That could be a good option for people whose health issues might make it difficult to qualify for an affordable individual policy.\n", "\nWhen searching for a policy to supplement your employer's plan, thoroughly research and compare all of your options to make certain you're getting the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/best-life-insurance-companies-4845858\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">best life insurance</a> policy possible.\n"]}
