Companies employ this inventory strategy to increase efficiency and decrease waste by receiving goods only as they need them for\u00a0the production process, which reduces\u00a0inventory costs. This method requires producers to forecast demand accurately.\n", "\nThe JIT inventory system contrasts with just-in-case\u00a0strategies, wherein producers hold sufficient inventories to have enough product to absorb maximum market demand.\n", "\nOne example of a JIT\u00a0inventory system is a car manufacturer that operates with low inventory levels but heavily relies on its supply chain to deliver the parts it requires to build cars, on an as-needed basis. Consequently, the manufacturer orders the parts required to assemble the cars, only after an order is received.\n", "\nFor JIT manufacturing to succeed, companies must have steady production, high-quality workmanship, glitch-free plant machinery, and reliable <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/insights/050116/walmart-stock-analyzing-5-key-suppliers-wmt.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">suppliers</a>.\n", "\nJIT inventory systems have several advantages over traditional models. Production runs are short, which means that manufacturers can quickly move from one\u00a0product to another. Furthermore, this method reduces costs by minimizing warehouse needs. Companies also spend less money on <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rawmaterials.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">raw materials</a> because they buy just enough resources to make the ordered products and no more.\n", "\nThe disadvantages of JIT inventory systems involve potential disruptions in the supply chain. If a raw materials\u00a0supplier\u00a0has a breakdown and cannot deliver the goods in a timely manner, this could conceivably stall the entire production process. A sudden unexpected order for goods may delay the delivery of finished products to end clients.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/kanban.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kanban</a> is a Japanese scheduling system that's often used in conjunction with lean manufacturing and JIT. Taiichi Ohno, an industrial engineer at Toyota, developed kanban in an effort to improve manufacturing efficiency.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff The system highlights problem areas by measuring lead and cycle times across the production process, which helps identify upper limits for work-in-process inventory, in order to avoid overcapacity.\n", "\nFamous for its JIT inventory system, Toyota Motor Corporation orders parts only when it receives new car orders. Although the company installed this method in the 1970s,<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff it took 20 years to perfect it.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nSadly, Toyota's JIT inventory system nearly caused the company to come to a screeching halt in February 1997, after a fire at Japanese-owned automotive parts supplier Aisin decimated its capacity to produce P-valves for Toyota's vehicles. Because Aisin is the sole supplier of this part, its weeks-long shutdown caused Toyota to halt production for several days. This caused a ripple effect, where other Toyota parts suppliers likewise had to temporarily shut down because the automaker had no need for their parts during that time period. Consequently, this <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/883f/f2c8e480f9541cf8bf2128e38d60a95fc8cf.pdf\">fire cost Toyota 160 billion yen in revenue</a>.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\"></span>\n", "\nA just-in-time (JIT) inventory system is a management strategy that has a company to receive goods as close as possible to when they are actually needed. So, if a car assembly plant needs to install airbags, it does not keep a stock of airbags on its shelves, but receives them as those cars come onto the assembly line.\n", "\nA chief benefit of a JIT system is that it minimizes the need for a company to store large quantities of inventory, thereby improving efficiency and providing a substantial cost saving. However, if there is a supply or demand shock, it can bring everything to a halt. For instance, at the beginning of the COVID19 pandemic, everything from ventilators to surgical masks experienced disruption as inputs from overseas could not reach their destinations in time to meet a surge in demand.\n", "\nThe JIT inventory system is popular with small businesses and major corporations alike because it enhances cash flow and reduces the amount of capital needed to run the business. Retailers, restaurants, on-demand publishing, tech manufacturing, and automobile manufacturing are some examples of industries that have benefited from just-in-time inventory.\n", "\nJIT is attributed to the Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corporation. Executives at Toyota in the 1970s reasoned that the company could adapt more quickly and efficiently to changes in trends or demands for model changes if it did not keep any more inventory in-store than was immediately needed.\n"]}
