A <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/depository.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">depository</a> entity can issue certificates when there's heavy demand from investors for ownership in a specific company from abroad.

For example, American investors can invest in Royal Mail PLC, a postal and delivery service company from the United Kingdom that was founded by Henry VIII. The company's unsponsored ADR trades OTC under the ticker symbol ROYMY.\n"]}
