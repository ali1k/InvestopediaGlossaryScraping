Actuarial science applies\u00a0the mathematics of probability and statistics to define, analyze, and solve the financial implications of uncertain future events. Traditional actuarial science largely revolves around the analysis of mortality and the production of life tables, and the application of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/compoundinterest.asp\">compound interest</a>.\n", "\nActuarial science attempts to quantify the risk of an event occurring using probability analysis so that its financial impact can be determined. Actuarial science is typically used in the insurance industry by actuaries. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/actuary.asp\">Actuaries</a> analyze mathematical models to predict or forecast the reasonableness of an event occurring so that an insurance company can allocate funds to pay out any claims that might result from the event. For example, studying mortality rates of individuals of a certain age would help insurance companies understand the likelihood or timeframe of paying out a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lifeinsurance.asp\">life insurance</a> policy.\n", "\nActuarial science became a formal mathematical discipline in the late 17th century with the increased demand for long-term insurance coverage.\u00a0Actuarial science spans\u00a0several\u00a0interrelated subjects, including\u00a0mathematics,\u00a0probability theory,\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/statistics.asp\">statistics</a>,\u00a0finance,\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/11/difference-between-finance-and-economics.asp\">economics</a>, and\u00a0computer science. Historically, actuarial science used deterministic models in the construction of tables and premiums. In the last 30 years, science has undergone revolutionary changes\u00a0due to the proliferation of high-speed computers and the union of\u00a0stochastic\u00a0actuarial models with modern financial theory.\n", "\nMany colleges and universities offer degrees in actuarial science, which consists of a solid foundation course in mathematics, statistics, and economics and on all types of investments.\n", "\nLife insurance and pension plans are the two main applications of actuarial science. However, actuarial science is also applied in the study of financial organizations to analyze their <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liability.asp\">liabilities</a> and improve financial decision-making. Actuaries employ this specialty science to evaluate the financial, economic, and other business applications of future events.\n", "\nIn traditional life insurance, actuarial science focuses on the analysis of\u00a0mortality, the production of\u00a0life tables, and the application of\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/compoundinterest.asp\">compound interest</a>, which is the accumulated interest from previous periods\u00a0plus the interest on the principal investment. As a result, actuarial science can help develop policies for financial products such as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/annuity.asp\">annuities</a>, which are investments that pay a fixed income stream. Actuarial science is also used to determine the various financial outcomes for investable assets held by non-profit corporations as a result of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/endowment.asp\">endowments</a>.\u00a0\n", "\nIn health insurance, including employer-provided plans\u00a0and social insurance, actuarial science includes analyzing\u00a0rates of\n", "\nFor example, disability rates are determined for veterans that may have been wounded in the line of duty. Certain percentages are assigned to the extent of the disability to determine the payout from disability insurance.\n", "\nActuarial science is also applied to property, casualty, liability, and general insurance\u2013instances in which\u00a0coverage is generally provided on a renewable period, (such as yearly). Coverage can be canceled at the end of the period by either party.\n", "\nIn the pension industry, actuarial science compares the\u00a0costs of alternative strategies with regard to the design, funding, accounting, administration, and maintenance or redesign of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pensionplan.asp\">pension plans</a>.\u00a0A pension plan is a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/definedbenefitpensionplan.asp\">defined-benefit plan</a>, which is a type of retirement plan involving contributions from the employer to be set aside and paid out to the employees upon retirement.\n", "\nShort-term and long-term bond rates greatly influence pension plans and their investment strategies. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp\">Bonds</a> are debt instruments issued by governments and corporations that typically pay a periodic interest rate. For example, in a low-interest-rate environment, a pension plan might have difficulty earning income from the bonds that it has invested in, which increases the probability that the pension plan could run out of money.\n", "\nOther factors impacting a pension plan's viability include benefit arrangements,\u00a0collective bargaining,\u00a0the employer's\u00a0competitors,\u00a0and changing demographics of the workforce. Tax laws and the policies of the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irs.asp\">Internal Revenue Service (IRS)</a> regarding the calculation of pension surpluses also impact the finances of a pension plan. Additionally, economic conditions and\u00a0trends in the financial markets can impact the probability of a pension plan remaining funded.\n"]}
