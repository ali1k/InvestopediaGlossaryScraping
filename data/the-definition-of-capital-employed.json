However, it is a frequently used term that is at the same time very difficult to define because there are so many contexts in which it can be used. All definitions generally refer to the capital investment necessary for a business to function.\n", "\nCapital investments include stocks and long-term liabilities. It also refers to the value of assets used in the operation of a business. In other words, it is a measure of the value of assets minus <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentliabilities.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">current liabilities</a>. Both of these measures can be found on the balance sheet. A current liability is the portion of debt that must be paid back within one year. In this way, capital employed is a more accurate estimate of total assets.\n", "\nCapital employed is better interpreted by combining it with other information to form an analysis metric such as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/roce.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">return on capital employed</a> (ROCE).\n", "\nCapital employed is primarily used by analysts to determine the return on capital employed (ROCE). Like <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnonassets.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">return on assets</a> (ROA), investors use ROCE to get an approximation for what their return might be in the future. Return on capital employed (ROCE) is thought of as a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profitabilityratios.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">profitability ratio</a>. It compares net operating profit to capital employed and tells investors how much each dollar of earnings is generated with each dollar of capital employed.\n", "\nSome analysts prefer return on capital employed over return on equity and return on assets since it takes long-term financing into consideration, and is a better gauge for the performance or profitability of the company over a longer period of time.\n", "\nA higher return on capital employed suggests a more efficient company, at least in terms of capital employment. A higher number may also be indicative of a company with a lot of cash on hand since cash is included in total assets. As a result, high levels of cash can sometimes skew this metric.\n", "\nReturn on capital employed is calculated by dividing net operating profit, or earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), by employed capital. Another way to calculate it is by dividing earnings before interest and taxes by the difference between total assets and current liabilities.\n", "\nLet's calculate the historical return on capital employed by three tech companies\u2014Alphabet Inc., Apple Inc., and Microsoft Corporation\u2014for the fiscal year ended 2017.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nOf the three companies, Apple Inc. has the highest return on capital employed of 24.19%. A return on capital employed of 24.19% means that for every dollar invested in capital employed for 12 months ended September 30, 2017, the company made 24 cents in profits.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff Investors are interested in the ratio to see how efficiently a company uses its capital employed as well as its long-term financing strategies.\n"]}
