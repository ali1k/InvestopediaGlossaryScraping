Although a good insurance policy won\u2019t prevent any of life\u2019s calamities, it should make the financial consequences easier to bear. Underinsurance, however, can leave the enrollee liable for a large financial expense if a serious event occurs. Whether it\u2019s a home damaged by a hurricane or fire, or an insured person experiencing a serious disease or accident, insurance should ideally cover enough of the expense that the policyholder can manage the difference.\n", "\nYou can be underinsured if your policy has gaps or exclusions that leave you without coverage. Or it could be that your claim exceeds the maximum amount that can be paid out by the insurance policy.\u00a0A lower-benefits policy may seem attractive because you pay lower monthly <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurance-premium.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">insurance premiums</a>. But if the policy leaves you underinsured, the loss arising from a claim may far exceed any marginal savings in insurance premiums.\n", "\nUnderinsurance can cause a serious financial crisis, depending on the asset that is insured and the extent of the shortfall in insurance.\n", "\nInsurance costs for home and rental properties are on the upswing. On average, they\u2019ve increased by almost 60% in the past 10 years. This partly reflects the rising costs of construction and an increase in severe weather-related damage. Higher rate increases have occurred in California, Nebraska, and Illinois, to name just three states, because of spikes in fire and storm damage claims. Civil disturbances may also result in a high number of claims and subsequent rate increases.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nUnderinsurance for your home can cause a serious financial crisis, depending on the amount of damage and the extent of the shortfall in insurance. Consider a house and its contents, for example, that are insured <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/against-all-risks.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">against all risks</a> for $250,000 with a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deductible.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">deductible</a> of $20,000. The house is subsequently destroyed in a fire, and the cost to replace the residence and its contents comes to $350,000. That will require the homeowner to make up the difference of $100,000\u2014plus the $20,000 deductible\u2014from their own resources.\n", "\nThe percentage of U.S. adults with no health insurance decreased from 20% in 2010 to 12% in 2018. However, the percentage of adults who are <em>underinsured</em> increased from 16% in 2010 to 23% in 2018.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nWhen individuals and families are underinsured, they may have to take on debt to pay deductibles and medical bills. They may postpone needed care, such as not going to the doctor when sick, skipping a test or treatment recommended by a doctor, not seeing a specialist, or not filling a prescription because of the cost.\n", "\nA person is considered underinsured if their <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outofpocket.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">out-of-pocket healthcare expenses</a> are between 5% and 10% of their annual income, or if their health plan deductible is more than 5% of their annual income, according to the Commonwealth Fund. One-quarter of Americans with employer-sponsored health insurance were underinsured in 2020 <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"#_ftn2\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><sup><span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"5\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff </sup></a>\n", "\nChoosing a health insurance plan often involves striking a balance between lower monthly premium levels (which often mean <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/051415/what-difference-between-copay-and-deductible.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">higher deductibles and higher copays</a>) and more comprehensive coverage.

When services are covered, cost-sharing may be very high. A May 2020 Commonwealth Fund study, for example, calculated the out-of-pocket costs for COVID-19 patients with short term plans in Georgia, Louisiana, and Ohio. For patients with a moderate case of the virus, patient costs ranged from $14,600 to $17,750. For a severe case of COVID, patient costs ranged from $28,600 to $35,000.<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"#_ftn6\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><sup><span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"9\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff </sup></a>\n"]}
