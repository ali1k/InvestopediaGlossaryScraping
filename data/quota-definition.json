Countries use quotas in international trade to help regulate the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volumeoftrade.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">volume of trade</a> between them and other countries. Countries sometimes impose quotas on specific products to reduce <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/import.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">imports</a> and increase\u00a0domestic production. In theory, quotas boost\u00a0domestic production by restricting foreign competition.\n", "\nGovernment programs that implement quotas are often referred to as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/protectionism.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">protectionism</a> policies. Additionally, governments can enact these policies if they have concerns over the quality or safety of products arriving from other countries.\n", "\nIn business, a quota can refer to a sales target that a company wants a salesperson or sales team to achieve for a specific period. Sales quotas are often monthly, quarterly, and yearly. Management can also set sales quotas by region or business unit. The most common type of sales quota is based on <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/revenue.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">revenue</a>.\n", "\nQuotas are different from <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tariff.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tariffs</a>\u00a0or customs, which place taxes on imports or exports. Governments impose both quotas and tariffs as\u00a0protective measures to try to control trade between countries, but there are distinct differences between them.\n", "\nQuotas focus on limiting the quantities (or, in some cases, cumulative value) of a particular good that a country\u00a0imports or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/export.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">exports</a> for a specific period, whereas\u00a0tariffs impose\u00a0specific fees on those goods. Governments design tariffs (also known as customs duties) to raise the overall cost to the producer or supplier\u00a0seeking to sell products within a country. Tariffs provide a country with extra revenue and they offer protection to domestic producers by causing imported items to become more expensive.\n", "\nQuotas are more effective in restricting trade than\u00a0tariffs, especially if domestic demand for something is not price-sensitive. Quotas may also be more disruptive to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/what-international-trade/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">international trade</a> than tariffs. Applied selectively to various countries, they can be utilized as a coercive economic weapon.\n", "\nThe U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency, a federal law-enforcement agency of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, oversees the regulation of international trade, collecting customs, and enforcing U.S. trade regulations. Within the United States, the three forms of quotas are absolute, tariff-rate, and tariff-preference level:<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nVarious commodities are subject to tariff-rate quotas when entering the United States.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff These eligible <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commodity.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">commodities</a> include, but are not limited to, milk and cream, cotton\u00a0fabric, blended syrups, Canadian cheese, cocoa powder, infant formula, peanuts, sugar, and tobacco.\n", "\nHighly restrictive quotas coupled with high tariffs can lead to trade disputes, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trade-war.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">trade wars</a>, and other problems between nations. For example, in January 2018, President Trump imposed 30% tariffs\u00a0on imported solar panels from China.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff This move\u00a0signaled\u00a0a more aggressive approach toward China's political and economic stance. It was also a blow to the U.S. solar industry, which was responsible for generating $18.7 billion of investment in the American economy and which at the time imported 80% to 90% of its solar panel products.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"6\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff <span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"5\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n"]}
