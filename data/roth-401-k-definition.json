This type of investment account is well-suited for people who think they will be in a higher tax bracket in retirement than they are now, as withdrawals are tax-free.

When a traditional 401(k) is funded, the contribution is deducted from the employee's pretax income. Alternatively, contributions made to a Roth 401(k) are made after taxes are already taken out.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"7\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nWhen a distribution is made from a traditional 401(k), the account holder is subject to taxation on\u00a0the contributions\u00a0and its earnings.

This is because contributions are taxed now at a lower tax rate and distributions are tax-free when the individual is in a higher tax bracket. Younger individuals also have more time for the account to grow tax-free before retirement and, thus, to benefit more from the fact that distributions of not just contributions but earnings are not taxed.\n", "\nThat's why a Roth 401(k) may be less beneficial to those who expect\u00a0to drop tax brackets, such as individuals close to retirement who expect\u00a0a drop in income.\n", "\nIn 2001, Congress passed the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/egtrra.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act</a> (EGTRRA).
