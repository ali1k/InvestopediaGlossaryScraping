Maximum loan amounts are used for standard loans, credit cards, and line-of-credit accounts.\n", "\nThe maximum will depend on several factors including a borrower's creditworthiness, length of the loan, loan purpose, whether the loan is backed by collateral, as well as various criteria of the lender.\n", "\nA maximum loan amount for a borrower is based on a combination of factors and determined by a loan <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underwriter.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">underwriter</a>. It is the maximum amount of money that will be provided to a borrower if the loan is approved. Lenders consider a borrower\u2019s <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dti.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">debt-to-income</a> ratio during the underwriting process, which helps to determine how much they believe the borrower would be able to repay and therefore what the maximum loan amount should be. Lenders generally seek borrowers with debt-to-income ratios of 36% or less.\n", "\nLenders must also consider their own risk parameters when determining a borrower\u2019s total principal. Thus, maximum loan amounts can also be based on the risk diversification of a lender.\n", "\nCredit cards are an example of unsecured lending. Credit card issuers also use underwriting to determine how much they trust a borrower to repay\u2014the maximum loan amount or credit limit. One of the primary factors they consider is credit history, which includes repayment history, the number of credit accounts on a report, and the length of a person's credit history. Credit card issuers will also check the number of inquiries on a credit report and the derogatory marks, which include bankruptcies, collections, civil judgments, and tax liens. They also may take into account an applicant's work history.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/personal-loan-5076027\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Personal loans</a> are also available unsecured.

Having better credit scores may help you qualify for a lower annual percentage rate.\n", "\nWith <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/secured-loans-5076025\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">secured loans</a>\u2014specifically mortgage loans<strong>\u2014</strong>lenders use an additional <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/qualifying_ratios.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">qualifying ratio</a> called the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/housing_expense_ratio.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">housing expense ratio</a>, which compares the borrower's housing expenses to their pre-tax income. Housing expenses generally include the potential mortgage principal and interest payments, property taxes, hazard insurance, mortgage insurance, and association fees. Lenders will typically look for a housing expense ratio no higher than 28%. Similar to standard loans, secured lenders will also analyze a borrower\u2019s debt-to-income with 36% being the common threshold required.\n", "\nThey also base a maximum loan amount on customized loan-to-value thresholds. Secured lenders will often lend between 70%-90% of a secured asset\u2019s <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/collateral-value.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">collateral value</a>.

As its name implies, the maximum loan amount is based on the equity you have in your home. If you need money, it can be a better choice than a credit card because the interest rate may be lower and the amount you can borrow higher. If you have trouble paying back what you borrow, however, you can risk losing your home.\n", "\nGovernment-sponsored loans offer some exceptions to the underwriting requirements and maximum loan amounts for certain types of home loans. These loans may accept borrowers with debt-to-income ratios of up to 50%.

Since Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guarantee a large percentage of mortgages originated in the United States, the \"conforming loan limit\"\u2014that is, loans that conform to these entities' guidelines\u2014is an important number in the mortgage finance industry.\n", "\n<br/>\n"]}
