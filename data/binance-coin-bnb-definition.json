It supports multiple utilities on the Binance ecosystem, which includes paying for trading fees, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exchange-fees.asp\">exchange fees</a>, listing fees, and any other fees on the Binance exchange.\n", "\nThe first year launch offer provides a 50% discount on trades through Binance coin, and the discount percentage reduces by half each year.

Binance coin is also supported by the platform, the mobile app, and the VISA debit card of Monaco, the pioneering payments and cryptocurrency platform.\n", "\nBinance platform also has a repurchase plan, under which it will use 20% of its profits to buy back BNB tokens, and burn/destroy them until a maximum of 50%, or 100 million, BNB tokens are bought back. This process will leave only 100 million BNB tokens in circulation, helping it maintain a substantial value. Mid April-2018, the Binance team <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://support.binance.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002684252-Binance-3rd-Quarterly-Token-Burn\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced</a> that it completed the burn of 2,220,314 BNB tokens (roughly $30 million).\n", "\nConsistent coin burns with increasing burn percentage as per the scheduled plans indicate the Binance exchange's profitability.\n", "\nThe coin was launched during an\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/initial-coin-offering-ico.asp\">initial coin offering (ICO)</a> in July 2017.

At present, it does not offer exchange against fiat currencies and exchange in BNB is possible only through cryptocoins like bitcoin or ether tokens.\n", "\nBinance will eventually become the native currency of the decentralized Binance exchange.\n"]}
