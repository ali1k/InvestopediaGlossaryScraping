Targeting institutional investors, the share class often has a high minimum investment, beginning at approximately $25,000. This share class also offers the benefit of waived or limited load charges and lower comparative total annual fees.\n", "\nY-shares are an alternative to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/institutionalshares.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">I-shares</a> which are in\u00a0the most commonly offered mutual fund share class for <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/institutionalinvestor.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">institutional investors</a>. Y-shares have features and characteristics that are tailored to institutions.\n", "\nHigh minimum investments are one of the most distinguishable characteristics of Y-shares and other institutional shares classes. Minimum investments typically begin at $25,000 and can be as high as $5 million. Sales loads are usually not required for Y-shares, which allows institutional investors to buy and sell shares with no added commission charges.\n", "\nSince Y-shares are not associated with intermediary sales charges, they also usually do not pay any distribution fees or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/12b-1fees.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">12b-1 fees</a> from the fund\u2019s expenses. Without 12b-1 fees, the total expense ratios are lower overall than other share classes in the fund, which is another benefit for institutional investors.\n", "\nWhile Y-shares are typically reserved for institutional investors, they may allow investment from retirement plan investors in some cases. Most <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutualfund.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mutual funds</a> will have designated retirement share classes with similar benefits to institutional shares.\n", "\nFunds without retirement share classes may allow pooled fund investments in Y-shares from retirement plans that collectively seek investment in the fund. This can provide a significant benefit to retirement shareholders, who would take part in\u00a0the savings from the share class\u2019s lower fees.\n", "\nPutnam Investments is one investment manager that offers Y-shares across many of its funds as the primary share class for institutional investors. The <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www.putnam.com/individual/mutual-funds/funds/36-global-equity-fund/A\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Putnam Global Equity Fund</a> provides one example. The Fund offers <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/a-shares.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A-shares</a>, B-shares, C-shares, M-shares, R-shares, R6-shares, T-shares, and Y-shares.\n", "\nThe Putnam Global Equity Fund\u2019s Y-share class charges no front-end or back-end sales commissions. The share class also charges no 12b-1 fees, which helps it to have one of the lowest annual expense ratios in the Fund at 0.90%. This compares to total annual fund operating expenses of 1.9% for the B-shares and C-shares.\n", "\nPerformance for the Y-shares as of March 30, 2020, was also one of the highest in the Fund for the last five years at 5.81%.\n"]}
