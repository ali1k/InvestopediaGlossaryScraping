These payments are often done discreetly and are not disclosed to clients, although they use client funds to pay the fees.\n", "\nRetrocession commission is a heavily criticized fee-sharing arrangement in the financial industry because money flows back to marketers for their efforts in raising interest for a\u00a0particular product. Therefore, this raises the question of impartiality and favoritism on the part of the advisor. The system would seem to encourage advisors to promote funds or products because they will receive a fee for doing so,\u00a0not because the products are the best option for the client.\n", "\nRetrocession fees are <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commission.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">commissions</a> paid to a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wealthmanagement.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">wealth manager</a> or other new money manager by a third party. For example, banks often pay retrocession fees to wealth managers who partner with them. The bank will encourage and compensate\u00a0the managers for bringing business to the bank. Banks may also receive retrocession fees from third parties, such as investment funds, for distributing\u00a0or promoting specific financial products.\n", "\nSome consider retrocession fees a dubious\u00a0compensation model\u00a0because they can influence a bank or wealth manager\u2019s decision\u00a0to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investment-advice.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">recommend products</a> that may not be in the best interest of their clients. This\u00a0suggestion of an investment product where the advisor receives retrocession appears inherently problematic. However, the suggested product is usually suited for the client, as they are mostly high-quality investment products, such as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutualfund.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mutual funds</a>. But the issue remains of motivation and agenda, when two roughly equal products are available, one with compensation attached and one without, where some advisors may find themselves unduly influenced.\n", "\nRetrocession fees typically refer to recurring compensations, as opposed to a one-time deal. A one-off payment is generally called a finder\u2019s fee, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/092815/financial-advisor-allowed-pay-referral-fee.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">referral fee</a>\u00a0or acquisition commission.\n", "\nThere are\u00a0three types of retrocession fees:\n", "\nIn\u00a02015, JP Morgan\u00a0settled a\u00a0case with the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</a>\u00a0for $267 million. The\u00a0SEC stated that JP Morgan\u00a0selected third-party hedge funds based on\u00a0hedge fund managers' willingness to provide fees to a bank affiliate. In these instances, the bank did not\u00a0inform clients it suggested and preferred the mutual funds willing to share their royalties and instead implied no particular partiality.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff According to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/edwardsiedle/2018/02/09/jp-morgan-asset-management-sec-settlement-exposes-hedge-fund-retrocessions/#6a19bb085c77\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Forbes</em></a>, the JP Morgan settlement was the first time the term retrocession was introduced to U.S.\u00a0investors.\n"]}
