It is more accurate to use a weighted average number of common shares over the reporting term because the number of shares can change over time.\n", "\nAny stock dividends or splits that occur must be reflected in the calculation of the weighted average number of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outstandingshares.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">shares outstanding</a>.

It is also a major component used to calculate the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-earningsratio.asp\">price-to-earnings</a> (P/E) valuation ratio, where the <em>E</em> in P/E refers to EPS. By dividing a company's share price by its earnings per share, an investor can see the value of a stock in terms of how much the market is willing to pay for each dollar of earnings.\n", "\nEPS is one of the many indicators you could use to pick stocks.

Basic EPS does not factor in the dilutive effect of shares that could be issued by the company. When the capital structure of a company includes items such as stock options, warrants, restricted stock units (RSU), these investments\u2014if exercised\u2014could increase the total number of shares outstanding in the market.\n", "\nTo better illustrate the effects of additional securities on per-share earnings, companies also report the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dilutedeps.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">diluted EPS</a>, which assumes that all shares that could be outstanding have been issued.\n", "\nFor example, the total number of shares that could be created and issued from NVIDIA's convertible instruments for the fiscal year ended in 2017 was 33 million. If this number is added to its total shares outstanding, its diluted weighted average shares outstanding will be 599 million + 33 million = 632 million shares. The company's diluted EPS is, therefore, $3.05B / 632 million = $4.82.\n", "\nSometimes an adjustment to the numerator is required when calculating a fully diluted EPS. For example, sometimes a lender will provide a loan that allows them to convert the debt into shares under certain conditions. The shares that would be created by the convertible debt should be included in the denominator of the diluted EPS calculation, but if that happened, then the company wouldn\u2019t have paid interest on the debt. In this case, the company or analyst will add the interest paid on convertible debt back into the numerator of the EPS calculation so the result isn\u2019t distorted.\n", "\nEarnings per share can be distorted, both intentionally and unintentionally by several factors. Analysts use variations of the basic EPS formula to avoid the most common ways that EPS may be inflated.\n", "\nImagine a company that owns two factories that make cell phone screens. The land on which one of the factories sits\u00a0has become very valuable as new developments have surrounded it over the last few years. The company\u2019s management team decides to sell the factory and build another one on less valuable land. This transaction creates a windfall profit for the firm.\n", "\nWhile this land sale has created real profits for the company and its shareholders, it is considered an \u201cextraordinary item\u201d because there is no reason to believe the company can repeat that transaction in the future.

Two companies could generate the same EPS, but one could do so with fewer net assets; that company would be more efficient at using its capital to generate income and, all other things being equal, would be a \"better\" company in terms of efficiency. A metric that can be used to identify companies that are more efficient is the return on equity (ROE).\n", "\nWhile EPS is widely used as a way to track a company\u2019s performance, shareholders do not have direct access to those profits. A portion of the earnings may be distributed as a dividend, but all or a portion of the EPS can be retained by the company. Shareholders, through their representatives on the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/boardofdirectors.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">board of directors</a>, would have to change the portion of EPS that is distributed through dividends in order to access more of those profits.\n", "\nBecause shareholders can\u2019t access the EPS attributed to their shares, the connection between EPS and a share\u2019s price can be difficult to define. This is particularly true for companies that pay no dividend. For example, it is common for technology companies to disclose in their <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ipo.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">initial public offering</a> documents that the company does not pay a dividend and has no plans to do so in the future. On the surface, it is difficult to explain why these shares would have any value to shareholders.\n", "\nThe actual notional value of EPS also seems to have a relatively indirect relationship with the share price. For example, the EPS for two stocks could be identical, but the share prices may be wildly different. For example, in October 2018, Southwestern Energy Company (SWN) earned $1.06 per share in diluted earnings from continuing operations, with a share price of $5.56. However, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=mlnx\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mellanox Technologies (MLNX)</a> had an EPS of $1.02 from continuing operations with a share price of $70.58.\n", "\nOn the surface, it seems like SWN is the better deal because an investor is only paying $5.25 per dollar of earnings ($5.56 share price / $1.06 EPS = $5.25). Investors in MLNX are paying $69.20 per dollar of earnings ($70.58 share price / $1.02 EPS = $69.20). This ratio is also known as the earnings multiple or Price/Earnings (P/E) ratio.\n", "\nAlthough the comparison between MLNX and SWN is extreme, investors will generally find a comparison of EPS and share prices between industry groups to be difficult to compare. Stocks that are expected to grow (e.g., technology, retail, industrial) will have a larger price-to-EPS (P/E) ratio than those that are not expected to grow (e.g., utilities, consumer staples).\n", "\nMaking a comparison of the P/E ratio within an industry group can be helpful, though in unexpected ways. Although it seems like a stock that costs more relative to its EPS when compared to peers might be \u201covervalued,\u201d the opposite tends to be the rule. Investors are willing to pay more for a stock, regardless of its historical EPS, if it is expected to grow or outperform its peers. In a bull market, it is normal for the stocks with the highest PE ratios in a stock index to outperform the average of the other stocks in the index.\n", "\nWhat counts as a \u201cgood\u201d earnings per share (EPS) will depend on factors such as the recent performance of the company, the performance of its competitors, and the expectations of the analysts who follow the stock. Sometimes, a company might report growing EPS but the stock might decline in price if analysts were expecting an even higher number. Likewise, a shrinking EPS figure might nonetheless lead to a price increase if analysts were expecting an even worse result. It is important to always judge EPS in relation to the company\u2019s share price, such as by looking at the company\u2019s <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-earningsratio.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">price to earnings ratio (P/E)</a> or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earningsyield.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">earnings yield</a>.\n", "\nAnalysts will sometimes distinguish between \u201cbasic\u201d and \u201cdiluted\u201d EPS. Basic EPS consists of the company\u2019s net income divided by its outstanding shares. It is the figure most commonly reported in the financial media, and it is also the simplest definition of EPS. Diluted EPS, on the other hand, will always be equal to or lower than basic EPS because it includes a more expansive definition of the company\u2019s shares outstanding. Specifically, it incorporates shares that are not currently outstanding but could become outstanding if stock options and other convertible securities were to be exercised.\n", "\nAdjusted EPS is a type of EPS calculation in which the analyst makes adjustments to the numerator. Typically, this consists of adding or removing components of net income that are deemed to be non-recurring. For instance, if the company\u2019s net income was increased based on a one-time sale of a building, the analyst might deduct the proceeds from that sale, thereby reducing net income. In that scenario, adjusted EPS would be lower than basic EPS.\n", "\nWhen looking at EPS to make an investment or trading decision, be aware of some possible drawbacks. For instance, a company can game its EPS by buying back stock, reducing the number of shares outstanding and inflating the EPS number given the same level of earnings. Changes to accounting policy for reporting earnings can also change EPS. EPS also does not take into account the price of the share, so it has little to say about whether a company's stock is over- or under-valued.\n", "\nAfter collecting the necessary data, input the net income,\u00a0preferred dividends,\u00a0and number of common shares outstanding into three adjacent cells, say B3 through B5. In cell B6, input the formula \"=B3-B4\" to subtract preferred dividends from net income. In cell B7, input the formula \"=B6/B5\" to render the EPS ratio.\n"]}
