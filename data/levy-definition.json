In other words, while a lien secures the government\u2019s interest or claim to an individual\u2019s or business\u2019s property when the tax debt remains unpaid, a levy actually permits the government to seize and sell the property to pay the tax debt.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nThe <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/internal-revenue-code.asp\">Internal Revenue Code</a> (IRC) authorizes levies to collect delinquent tax payments to the federal government. However, certain procedures must be followed and requirements met before enforcing a levy.
