After meeting standard requirements, the general partner decides whether to accept the candidate. Limited partners act as silent partners by providing capital, usually a one-time investment, and have no material participation in the business's operations.\n", "\nAs a result, they typically have little to no voice in the day-to-day operations\u00a0of the partnership and are exposed to less risk than full partners.\u00a0Each limited partner's exposure to business losses is limited to that partner's original investment. The subscription agreement for joining the limited\u00a0partnership describes\u00a0the investment experience, sophistication, and net worth of the potential limited partner.\n", "\nSubscription agreements are generally covered by SEC Rules 506(b) and 506(c) of Regulation D.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff <span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff These stipulations define the method of conducting an offering and the amount of material information that companies are required to disclose to investors.

The\u00a0partnership\u00a0entity does not pay taxes. Instead,\u00a0the profits and losses flow through to each partner. Partners will pay taxes on their distributive share of the partnership's taxable income based on a partner agreement.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\u00a0Law firms and accounting firms\u00a0are often formed\u00a0as general partnerships.\n", "\nWhen a company wishes to raise capital, they will often issue shares of stock for purchase by either the general public or through a\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/privateplacement.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">private placement</a>.

Some agreements outline a specific rate of return that will\u00a0be paid to the investor, such as a particular percentage of company net income\u00a0or lump sum payments. Also,\u00a0the agreement will define the payment dates for these returns. This structure gives priority to the investor, as he or she earns a rate of return on the investment before company founders or other minority owners.\n"]}
