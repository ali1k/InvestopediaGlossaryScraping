It can also be referred to as the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/timedecay.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">time decay</a> of an option. This means an option loses value as time moves closer to its <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maturitydate.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">maturity</a>, as long as everything is held constant. Theta is generally expressed as a negative number and can be thought of as the amount by which an option's value declines every day.\n", "\nTheta\u00a0is part of the group of measures known as the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/greeks.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Greeks</a>,\u00a0which are used in options\u00a0pricing. Remember\u2014options give the buyer the right to buy or sell an underlying asset at the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strikeprice.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">strike price</a>\u00a0before the option expires. The strike price, which is also called an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exerciseprice.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">exercise price</a>, is set when the contract is first written, informing the investor of the price at which the underlying asset must reach before the option can be exercised.\n", "\nThe measure of theta quantifies the risk that time poses to option buyers since options are only <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exercise.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">exercisable</a>\u00a0for a certain period of time. This is known as time decay or the erosion of the value of an option as time passes. An option's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/012715/what-difference-between-profitability-and-profit.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">profitability</a> decreases as time goes on. But what happens when two options are similar but one expires over a longer period of time? The value of the longer-term option is higher since there is a greater chance or more time that the option could move beyond the strike price.\n", "\nBecause theta represents the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risk.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">risk</a> of time and the loss of value of an option, it is always expressed as a negative figure. The value of the option diminishes as time passes until the expiration date. Since theta is always negative for long options, there will always be a zero time value when the option expires. This is why theta is a good thing for sellers but not for buyers\u2014value decreases from the buyer's side as time goes by, but increases for the seller. That's why <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/optioninvestor/09/selling-options.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">selling an option</a> is also known as a positive theta trade\u2014as theta accelerates, the seller's earnings on their options increase.\n", "\nIf all else remains equal, the time decay causes an option to lose <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/extrinsicvalue.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">extrinsic value</a>\u00a0as it approaches its expiration date. Therefore, theta is one of the main Greeks that option buyers should worry about since time works against <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">long</a>\u00a0option holders.\n", "\nConversely, time decay is favorable to an investor who <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/writing-an-option.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">writes</a>\u00a0options. Option writers benefit from time decay because the options written become less valuable as the time to expiration approaches. Consequently, it is cheaper for option writers to buy back the options to close out the short position.\n", "\nPut a different way, option values are, if applicable, composed of both extrinsic and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intrinsicvalue.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">intrinsic value</a>. At option expiration, all that remains is intrinsic value, if any, because time is a significant part of the extrinsic value.\n", "\nThe Greeks measure\u00a0the sensitivity of options\u00a0prices to their respective variables. For instance, the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/delta.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">delta</a>\u00a0of an option indicates the sensitivity of an option's price in relation to a $1 change in the underlying security while the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gamma.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">gamma</a>\u00a0of an option indicates the sensitivity of an option's delta in relation to a $1 change in the underlying security.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vega.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Vega</a>\u00a0indicates how an option's price theoretically changes for each one percentage point move in implied volatility.\n", "\nLet's assume an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investor.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">investor</a> purchases a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">call option</a> with a strike price of $1,150 for $5. The underlying stock is trading at $1,125. The option has five days until expiration\u00a0and theta is $1. In theory, the value of the option drops $1 per day until it reaches the expiration date. This is unfavorable to the option holder.\n", "\nAssume the underlying stock remains at $1,125 and two days have passed. The option will be\u00a0worth approximately $3. The only way the option becomes worth more than $5 again is if the price rises above $1,155. This would give the option at least $5 in intrinsic value ($1,155 - $1,150 strike price), offsetting the loss due to theta or time decay.\n"]}
