Tax havens do not typically require residency or business presence for individuals and businesses to benefit from their tax policies. In some cases, intranational locations may also be identified as tax havens if they have special tax laws. For example, in the United States, Alaska, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming require no state income tax.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"9\"></span>\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/offshore.asp\">Offshore</a> tax havens benefit from the capital their countries draw into the economy.

However, there are several regulatory bodies that monitor tax haven countries, including the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the U.S. Government Accountability Office.\n", "\nCharacteristics of tax haven countries generally include no or low-income taxes, minimal reporting of information, lack of transparency obligations, lack of local presence requirements, and marketing of tax haven vehicles.\n", "\nThe <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/taxes/trumps-tax-reform-plan-explained/\">Tax Cuts and Jobs Act</a> (TCJA), which passed in December 2017, set the effective corporate rate of U.S. taxes at 21%.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\"></span>\u00a0It also added several other provisions that discouraged foreign investments.\n", "\nSystematically, the TCJA is known for being more territorial in nature than previous international tax laws.

Overall, tax havens may also offer advantages in the area of credit, since it may be less expensive for U.S.-based companies to borrow funds internationally. This type of lending, which can potentially fund acquisitions and other corporate activities, is also subject to reporting within the guidelines of U.S. tax law, GAAP, and guidelines under IFRS.\n", "\nThe United States has special rules in place for the reporting of foreign income by U.S. citizens and non-U.S. citizens. These rules are generally governed under the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreign-account-tax-compliance-act-fatca.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act</a> (FATCA).\n", "\nFATCA requires the filing of a Schedule B and/or Form 8938, which provides disclosure of foreign account holdings when investments exceed $50,000.

There can be exemptions, credits, and special situations that can apply for foreign investments. Offshore investing can also create a lot of opportunities for illegal activities. As such, there can be a great deal of regulatory oversight.\n", "\nTo maximize tax receipts, many foreign governments maintain relatively constant pressure on tax havens to release information regarding offshore investment accounts. However, because of the monetary burdens, regulatory oversight may not always be a top national priority.\n", "\nWorldwide, there are some programs in place to increase the enforcement of offshore investment reporting. The Automatic Exchange of Financial Information is one example, overseen by OECD.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"6\"></span>\n", "\nThe program requires participating countries to automatically transmit tax-related banking information of non-citizen depositors for use by countries of citizens in the facilitation of taxes on income, earnings, interest, dividends, and royalties.\n", "\nCertain countries may be targets for offshore activities. For example, Cyprus\u2019s financial sector built on the country\u2019s tax haven status collapsed in 2013. The European Commission, European Central Bank, and International Monetary Fund predicated the $11.8 billion bailout on the country\u2019s agreement for compliance with more robust tax reporting and participation with the Automatic Exchange of Financial Information in Tax Matters program.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"8\"></span><span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"7\"></span>\u00a0\n", "\nTax havens are typically offshore countries that offer foreign individuals and businesses little or no tax liability in a politically and economically static environment.

Individuals and corporations can potentially benefit from low or no taxes charged on income in foreign countries where loopholes, credits, or other special tax considerations may be allowed in accordance with the law. That's a key point to note since there can be no advantage in engaging in illegal activity. Tax havens may also offer advantages in the area of credit, since it may be less expensive for U.S.-based companies to borrow funds internationally.\u00a0Also, they are discreet in that they share limited or no financial information with foreign tax authorities.\u00a0\n", "\nIn most instances, depositing funds in an offshore account is not an illegal activity. What is illegal is if this is being done with the express purpose to escape U.S. taxation. Citizens of the United States are required to pay the appropriate amount in taxes on all income generated either domestically or internationally. So, tax havens are technically legal for U.S entities provided they pay the legally mandated tax on those assets to the IRS.\n", "\nOffshore tax havens benefit from the capital their countries draw into the economy. Funds can flow in from individuals and businesses with accounts setup at banks, financial institutions, and other investment vehicles. This inflow of capital may be subject to fees or, in some instances, to a lower tax rate that can raise revenue for the tax haven country.\n", "\nA list of some of the most popular tax haven countries includes Andorra, the Bahamas, Belize, Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, the Channel Islands, the Cook Islands, The Island of Jersey, Hong Kong, The Isle of Man, Mauritius, Lichtenstein, Monaco, Panama, St. Kitts, and Nevis.
