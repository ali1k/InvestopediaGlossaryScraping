A core mission of NASBA is maintaining public trust in the profession in the wake of accounting scandals at companies such as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/enron.asp\">Enron</a>, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/worldcom.asp\">WorldCom</a>, and others.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\"></span>\n", "\nThe association also monitors and provides feedback for legislative and regulatory issues facing the accounting trade.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\"></span>\n", "\nNASBA\u00a0runs training and education programs for accountants for the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cpa.asp\">certified public accountant</a> (CPA) exam.

The NASBA\u00a0runs the National Qualification Appraisal Service, so that CPAs licensed in one state may have their qualifications recognized in another state.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\"></span>\n", "\nNASBA holds regional and national meetings each year, publishes comment letters and white papers, and disseminates its own annual report.
