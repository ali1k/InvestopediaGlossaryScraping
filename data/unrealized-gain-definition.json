It is an increase in the value of an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">asset</a> that has yet to be sold for cash, such as a stock position that has increased in value but still remains open.\n", "\nA gain becomes <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/realizedprofit.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">realized</a> once the position is sold for a profit. It is possible that if an unrealized gain is not sold in time that the potential profit could be erased if the position loses its profit value before it is sold.\n", "\nAn unrealized gain occurs when the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentprice.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">current price</a> of a security is higher than the price the investor initially paid for the security, net of brokerage fees. Many investors calculate the current value of their investment <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/portfolio.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">portfolios</a> based on unrealized values. In general, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalgain.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">capital gains</a> are taxed only when they are sold and become realized.\n", "\nWhen unrealized gains are present, it usually means an investor believes the investment has room for higher future gains. Otherwise, they would sell now and recognize the current gain. Additionally, unrealized gains sometimes come about because holding an investment for an extended time period lowers the tax burden of the gain.\n", "\nFor example, if an investor holds a stock for longer than one year, their tax rate is reduced to the long-term <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital_gains_tax.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">capital gains tax</a>. Further, if an investor wants to move the capital gains tax burden to another tax year, they can sell the stock in January of a proceeding year rather than selling in the current year.\n", "\nUnrealized gains are recorded differently depending on the type of security. Securities that are <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/held-to-maturity-security.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">held-to-maturity</a> are not recorded in the financial statements, but the company may decide to include a disclosure about them in the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/footnote.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">footnotes to the financial statements</a>.\n", "\nSecurities that are <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/held-for-trading-security.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">held-for-trading</a> are recorded on the balance sheet at their\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fairvalue.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fair value</a>, and the unrealized gains and losses are recorded on the income statement.\n", "\nTherefore, the increase or decrease in the fair value of held-for-trading securities impacts the company's net income and its <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eps.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">earnings-per-share</a> (EPS). Securities that are <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/available-for-sale-security.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">available-for-sale</a> are also recorded on a company's balance sheet as an asset at fair value. However, the unrealized gains and losses are recorded in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/comprehensiveincome.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">comprehensive income</a> on the balance sheet.\n", "\nThe opposite of an unrealized gain is an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unrealizedloss.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">unrealized loss</a>. This type of loss occurs when an investor holds onto a losing investment, such as a stock that has dropped in value since the position was opened. Similar to an unrealized gain, a loss becomes realized once the position is closed for a loss.\n", "\nUnrealized gains and unrealized losses are often called \"paper\" profits or losses since the actual gain or loss is not determined until the position is closed. A position with an unrealized gain may eventually turn into a position with an unrealized loss as the market fluctuates and vice versa.\n", "\nIf an investor purchased 100 shares of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">stock</a> in ABC Company at $10 per share, and the fair value of the shares subsequently rises to $12 per share, the unrealized gain on the shares still in their possession would be $200 ($2 per share * 100 shares). If the investor eventually sells the shares when the trading price is $14, they will have a realized gain of $400 ($4 per share * 100 shares).\n"]}
