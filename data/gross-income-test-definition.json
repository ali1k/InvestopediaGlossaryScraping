Furthermore, this test only applies to potential dependents that are over the age of 18\u00a0or over the age of 23 if the candidate in question is a full-time student.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff\n", "\nThe amount that a potential-dependent can earn is indexed for inflation each year and consequently\u00a0fluctuates\u00a0periodically. For 2019, for example, the limit was $4,200.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff This is a spike from the 2015 threshold of $4,000, and the 2008 limit of $3,500.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"5\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff Because of periodically shifting numbers, it's vital for individuals to make certain they base\u00a0the test on the correct, up-to-date figure, before moving on the other four dependency tests. If an individual fails the Gross Income Test or any of the other qualifying relative dependent metrics, they may not claim that dependent for purposes of the personal exemption. And in order to\u00a0claim a dependency exemption for a qualifying child, a series of qualifying child dependency tests must be met.\u00a0There's no age limit for a qualifying relative, and if you are entitled to claim an exemption for a dependent, said dependent might not claim a personal exemption on their own tax return.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"6\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gross_earnings.asp\">Gross income</a> of a qualifying relative that may be deemed a dependent takes into consideration the totality of an individual\u2019s combined income sources, which may be the form of money, and non-tax-exempt\u00a0property and services. The terms for calculating income from merchandising, mining, or manufacturing endeavors are extremely specific. Namely, gross income is viewed as\u00a0total net sales, less the cost of goods sold, plus any miscellaneous business income. Gross receipts from rental properties are deemed gross income. Other gross income includes any business partners\u2019 share of the gross partnership income, but not a share of the net profits. Gross income furthermore includes all taxable social security benefits, taxable unemployment compensation, and certain fellowship grants and scholarships an employer provides.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nFinally, if a household member pays legally obligated child support to a child outside the home, the child support is not counted in the initial gross income test.\u00a0And there are no gross income tests for households that include an elder or disabled member.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff <span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"7\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n"]}
