The protocol is used by the FIX community which includes nearly 300 member firms including all major investment banks.\n", "\nFIX has become\u00a0the de-facto messaging standard for pre-trade, trade, and post-trade communication, as well as for U.S. regulatory reporting. It is compatible with almost every commonly used network technology. FIX Protocol, Ltd. owns and maintains the FIX system. The company was formed entirely to fulfill that purpose and to ensure the system remains in the public domain.\n", "\nFIX communications include texting and email, securities trade allocations, news, order submissions and changing, trade advertising, and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/execution.asp\">execution</a> reporting. Mostly used for <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/btob.asp\">business-to-business</a> interactions, it is designed to improve business messages and transaction flow. FIX achieves this goal by minimizing redundancy and reducing time spent on telephone communications, written messages,\u00a0transactions, and documentation. The benefits are particularly obvious to funds, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investment-manager.asp\">investment managers</a>, and investment banking firms. FIX systems transfer accurate and timely financial information concerning <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp\">securities</a> trades through and across security exchange houses.\n", "\nIntroduced in 1992 for equity trading between <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/salomon-brothers.asp\">Salomon Brothers</a> and Fidelity Investments, the FIX protocol is similarly becoming a standard in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option.asp\">options</a> and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futuresexchange.asp\">futures exchanges</a>. It was implemented to provide for more efficient and accountable transactions and record-keeping, replacing a system that was handled mostly over the phone. Under the old system, indications of interest\u00a0were often lost \"on hold\" or routed to the wrong trader. FIX has become the standard electronic protocol for pre-trade communications and trade execution.\n", "\nOf note, the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/swift.asp\">Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication</a> (SWIFT) is the standard for <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/backoffice.asp\">back office</a> messaging, FIX is the standard for <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/frontoffice.asp\">front office</a> messaging.\n", "\nThe FIX is popular among both the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/buyside.asp\">buy side</a> (institutions) as well as the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sellside.asp\">sell side</a> (brokers/dealers) of the financial markets.

It is mainly used for equity transactions, although it can handle bond, foreign exchange, and derivatives transactions.\n", "\nCollaborative efforts of the\u00a0FIX Trading Community\u2122 member firms\u00a0maintain\u00a0and continue to develop the FIX messaging standard.
