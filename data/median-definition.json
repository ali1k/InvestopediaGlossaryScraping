To determine the median value in a sequence of numbers, the numbers must first be sorted, or arranged, in value order from lowest to highest or highest to lowest. The median can be used to determine an approximate average, or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mean.asp\">mean</a>, but is not to be confused with the actual mean.\n", "\nThe median is sometimes used as opposed to the mean when there are outliers in the sequence that might skew the average of the values. The median of a sequence can be less affected by outliers than the mean.\n", "\nTo find the median value in a list with an <strong>odd</strong> amount of numbers, one would find the number that is in the middle with an equal amount of numbers on either side of the median. To find the median, first arrange the numbers in order, usually from lowest to highest.\n", "\nFor example, in a data set of {3, 13, 2, 34, 11, 26, 47}, the sorted order becomes {2, 3, 11, 13, 26, 34, 47}. The median is the number in the middle {2, 3, 11, <strong>13</strong>, 26, 34, 47}, which in this instance is 13 since there are three numbers on either side.\n", "\nTo find the median value in a list with an <strong>even</strong> amount of numbers, one must determine the middle pair, add them, and divide by two. Again, arrange the numbers in order from lowest to highest.\n", "\nFor example, in a data set of {3, 13, 2, 34, 11, 17, 27, 47}, the sorted order becomes {2, 3, 11, 13, 17, 27, 34, 47}. The median is the average of the two numbers in the middle {2, 3, 11, <strong>13</strong>,<strong> 17</strong>,<strong> </strong>26<strong> </strong>34, 47}, which in this case is fifteen {(13 + 17) \u00f7 2 = 15}.\n"]}
