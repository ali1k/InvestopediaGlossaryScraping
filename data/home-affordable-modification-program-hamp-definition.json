The program's focus\u00a0was to help homeowners who paid more than 31% of their <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/grossincome.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">gross income </a>toward mortgage payments. The program expired at the end of 2016.\n", "\nHAMP\u00a0was created under the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/troubled-asset-relief-program-tarp.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Troubled Asset Relief Program</a> (TARP) in response to the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/subprime_mortgage.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">subprime mortgage</a> crisis of 2008. During this period, many American homeowners found themselves unable to sell or refinance their homes after the market crashed because of tighter credit markets. Monthly payments became unaffordable when higher market rates kicked in on adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), leaving plenty of people at risk of foreclosure.\n", "\nIn order to qualify, mortgagors needed to make more than 31% of their gross income on their monthly payments. Property requirements were also enforced\u2014they had to pass the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/npv.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">net present value</a> (NPV) test, along with other eligibility\u00a0standards.\n", "\nA property became eligible if the analysis showed a lender or investor currently holding the loan would make more money by modifying the loan rather than foreclosing. Other than the requirement that a homeowner prove financial hardship, the home had to be habitable and have an unpaid <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/principal.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">principal</a> balance under $729,750.\n", "\nRelief took several forms, all of which would have the effect of reducing monthly payments. For instance, eligible homeowners could receive reductions in their mortgage principal and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">interest rates</a>. There was also the possibility of a temporary postponement of mortgage payments\u2014also known as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forbearance.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">forbearance</a>. And, if favorable, a homeowner was able to extend their existing loan terms.\n", "\nIn many cases, an already modified loan was eligible for HAMP modification, too, reducing a homeowner\u2019s payment even further.\n", "\nThe government refers to the ratio of payments to gross income as the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/front-end-debt-to-income-ratio.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">front-end debt-to-income ratio</a> (DTI). The HAMP program, working in conjunction with mortgage lenders, helped provide incentives for banks to reduce the debt-to-income ratio to less than or equal to 38%. The <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/ustreasury.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Treasury</a> would then step in to minimize the DTI ratio to 31% or less.\u00a0\n", "\nHAMP\u00a0incentivized\u00a0private lenders and investors to fund their loan adjustments. Mortgage servicers received an up-front payment of $1,000 for each eligible modification they performed. These lenders were also eligible to receive up to $1,000 per year for each borrower in the program for up to three years.\n", "\nThe original HAMP was limited to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/principalresidence.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">principal residences</a>. In 2012, the program was then revised to include homes not occupied by the owner, households with multiple mortgages, and homeowners whose DTI ratio was either lower or higher than the original requirement of 31%.\n", "\nHAMP was complemented by another initiative called the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/home-affordable-refinance-program-harp.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Home Affordable Refinance Program</a> (HARP). Like HAMP, HARP was offered by the federal government. But there were a subtle few differences.\n", "\nWhile HAMP helped people who were on the verge of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreclosure.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">foreclosure</a>, homeowners needed to be underwater or close to that point to qualify for HARP. The program allowed people with homes worth less than the outstanding balance on their mortgages to refinance their loans, as well as homeowners with a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/loantovalue.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">loan-to-value ratio</a> (LTV) of more than 80%\u2014up to 125%.\n", "\nOnly those whose loans were guaranteed or acquired by <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/fannie-mae-loans/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fannie Mae</a> or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/freddiemac.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Freddie Mac</a> prior to May 31, 2009, were eligible. Eligibility was also contingent on whether the homeowner was up-to-date on their mortgage payments. In addition, mortgagors should have been able to benefit from lower payments or from switching to a more stable mortgage product.\n", "\nThe deadline for HARP was originally intended for Dec. 31, 2017. However, that date was extended, pushing the program's expiration date to December 2018.\n"]}
