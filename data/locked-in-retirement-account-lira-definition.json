The locked-in retirement account is designed to hold pension funds for a former plan member, an ex-spouse, or a surviving spouse.\n", "\nCash withdrawals are not permitted while the funds are locked in. Pension funds that are transferred to a LIRA can be used to purchase a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lifeannuity.asp\">life annuity</a> or can be transferred to a life income fund (LIF) or a locked-in retirement income fund (LRIF).\n", "\nOnce the fund's beneficiary reaches\u00a0retirement age, the life annuity, LIF, or LRIF provide a pension for life.\n", "\nA LIRA may be created to hold funds that are transferred from a pension plan for a variety of reasons.
