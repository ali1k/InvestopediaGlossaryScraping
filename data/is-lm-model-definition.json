At lower interest rates, investment is higher, which translates into more total output (GDP), so the IS curve slopes downward and to the right.\n", "\nThe LM curve depicts the set of all levels of income (GDP) and interest rates at which money supply equals money (liquidity) demand. The LM curve slopes upward because higher levels of income (GDP) induce increased demand to hold money balances for transactions, which requires a higher interest rate to keep money supply and liquidity demand in equilibrium.\n", "\nThe intersection of the IS and LM curves shows the equilibrium point of interest rates and output when money markets and the real economy are in balance. Multiple scenarios or points in time may be represented by adding additional IS and LM curves.\n", "\nIn some versions of the graph, curves display limited convexity or concavity. Shifts in the position and shape of the IS and LM curves, representing changing preferences for liquidity, investment, and consumption, alter the equilibrium levels of income and interest rates.\n", "\nMany economists, including many Keynesians, object to the IS-LM model for its simplistic and unrealistic assumptions about the macroeconomy. In fact, Hicks later admitted that the model's flaws were fatal, and it was probably best used as \"a classroom gadget, to be superseded, later on, by something better.\"<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff Subsequent revisions have taken place for so-called \"new\" or \"optimized\" IS-LM frameworks.\n", "\nThe model is a limited policy tool, as it cannot explain how tax or spending policies should be formulated with any specificity. This significantly limits its functional appeal. It has very little to say about inflation, rational expectations, or international markets, although later models do attempt to incorporate these ideas. The model also ignores the formation of capital and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/labor-productivity.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">labor productivity</a>.\n"]}
