Each bar shows how prices moved over a specified time period. A daily bar chart shows a price bar for each day. Each bar typically shows <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/ohlcchart.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">open, high, low, and closing</a> (OHLC) prices. This may be adjusted to show only the high, low, and close (HLC). <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technical-analyst.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Technical analysts</a> use bar charts\u2014or other chart types such as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/candlestick.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">candlestick</a> or line charts\u2014to monitor price action, which aids in trading decisions.\n", "\nBar charts allow traders to analyze <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trend.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">trends</a>, spot potential trend <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reversal.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reversals</a>, and monitor volatility and price movements.\n", "\nA bar chart is a collection of price bars, with each bar showing price movements for a given period. Each bar has a vertical line that shows the highest and lowest price reached during the period. The <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/openingprice.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">opening</a> price is marked by a small horizontal line on the <em>left </em>of the vertical line, and the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/closingprice.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">closing</a> price is marked by a small horizontal line on the <em>right </em>of the vertical line.\n", "\nIf the closing price is above the open price, the bar may be colored black or green. If the close is below the open, the price dropped during that period, so it could be colored red. Color coding the bars helps traders see trends and price movements more clearly. Color coding is available as an option in most <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/082115/are-you-trend-trader-or-swing-trader.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">charting platforms</a>.\n", "\nTraders and investors decide which period they want to analyze. A 1-minute bar chart, which shows a new price bar each minute, would be useful for a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/daytrader.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">day trader</a> but not an investor. A weekly bar chart, which shows a new bar for each week of price movement, may be appropriate for a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/buyandhold.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">long-term investor</a>, but not so much for a day trader.\n", "\nBecause a bar chart shows the open, high, low, and closing prices for each period, there is a lot of information that traders and investors can utilize on a bar chart.\n", "\nLong vertical bars show there was a big price difference between the high and low of the period. That means volatility increased during that period. When a bar has very small vertical bars, it means there was little volatility.\n", "\nIf there is a large distance between the open and close it means the price made a significant move. If the close is far above the open, it shows buyers were very active during the period, which may indicate more buying in future periods is forthcoming. If the close is very near the open, it shows there was not a lot of conviction in the price movement during the period.\n", "\nThe location of the close relative to the high and low may also provide valuable information. If an asset rallied higher during the period, but the close was well below the high, that shows that toward the end of the period sellers came in. That is less <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bull.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bullish</a> than if the asset closed near its high for the period.\n", "\nIf the bar chart is colored coded based on whether the price rises or falls during the period, the colors can provide information at a glance. An overall <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/uptrend.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">uptrend</a> is typically represented by more green/black bars and strong upward price movements. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/downtrend.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Downtrends</a> are typically represented by more red bars and strong downward price movements.\n", "\nBar charts are very similar to Japanese <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/trading/candlestick-charting-what-is-it/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">candlestick</a> charts. The two chart types show the same information but in different ways.\n", "\nA bar chart is composed of a vertical line with small horizontal lines on the left and right that show the open and close. Candlesticks also have a vertical line showing the high and low of the period (called a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shadow.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">shadow</a> or wick), but the difference between the open and close is represented by a thicker portion called a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/realbody.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">real body</a>. The body is shaded in or colored red if the close is below the open. The body is white or green if the close is above the open. While the information is the same, the visual look of the two chart types is different.\n", "\nThe following chart shows a bar chart for the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=spy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SPY</a>). During declines, the bars typically get longer, showing an increase in volatility. Declines are also marked by more down (red) price bars compared to up (green) bars.\n", "\nAs the price rises, there tend to be more green bars than red bars. This helps to visually spot the trend. Even though there are typically red <em>and </em>green bars during an uptrend (or downtrend), one is more dominant. This is how prices move. In order for the price to move higher within an uptrend, the price bars will need to reflect that by moving higher as well, on average. If the price starts moving lower, on average, by creating more red bars, then the price is moving into a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pullback.asp\">pullback</a> or a trend reversal.\n"]}
