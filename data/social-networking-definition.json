Social networking can have a social purpose, a business purpose, or both, through sites like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram. Social networking has become a significant base for marketers seeking to engage customers.\n", "\nDespite some stiff competition, Facebook remains the largest and most popular social network, with 2.8 billion people using the platform on a monthly basis, as of Dec. 31, 2020.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\"></span> It was followed, in order of popularity, by Instagram, Facebook Messenger, Twitter, and Pinterest, according to Statistica.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\"></span>\n", "\nSocial networking involves the development and maintenance of personal and business relationships using technology. This is done through the use of social networking sites, such as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/100215/twitter-vs-facebook-vs-instagram-who-target-audience.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter</a>.

They can share photos and updates on things that are going on in their lives. People can also connect with others (notably, strangers) who share the same interests. Individuals can find each other through groups, lists, and the use of hashtags.\n", "\nSocial networking is commonly used by marketers so they can increase <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brand-recognition.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">brand recognition</a> and encouraging brand loyalty. Since it makes a company more accessible to new customers and more recognizable for existing customers, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/social-media-marketing-smm.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">social media marketing</a> helps promote a brand\u2019s voice and content.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff\n", "\nFor example, a frequent <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/120114/how-does-twitter-twtr-make-money.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Twitter</a> user may hear of a company for the first time through a news feed and decide to buy a product or service. The more exposed people are to a company\u2019s brand, the greater the company's chances of finding and retaining new customers.\n", "\nMarketers use social networking as a way to improve <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/conversion-rate.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">conversion rates</a>. Building a following provides access to and interaction with new, recent, and old customers. Sharing blog posts, images, videos, or comments on social media allows followers to react, visit the company\u2019s website, and become customers.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff\n", "\nThere isn't a one-size-fits-all approach to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketing-strategy.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">marketing strategies</a>. That's because every business is unique and has a different target demographic, history, and competitive marketplace. Because social networking companies want businesses to pay for their advertising, companies often restrict the number of reach businesses may receive through unpaid posts. For example, if a company has 500 followers, followers may not all receive the same post.\n", "\nSocial networking has the ability to affect both individuals and corporations\u2014both positively and negatively. That's why it's important to weigh out both the advantages and disadvantages of using these social media sites.\n", "\nAs mentioned above, social networking allows individuals to keep in contact with family and friends they would otherwise not be able to connect with because of distance or because they simply lost touch. People can also connect with other individuals who share the same interests and develop new relationships.\n", "\nSocial networking also allows companies to connect with new and existing clients. They can also use social media to create, promote, and increase brand awareness. They also rely on reviews and comments made by their clientele. The more customers post about a company, the more valuable the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brand.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">brand</a> authority becomes. This leads to more sales and a higher ranking in search engines. Social networking can, therefore, help establish a brand as legitimate, credible, and trustworthy.\n", "\nA company may use social networking to demonstrate its customer service level and enrich its relationships with consumers. For example, if a customer complains about a product or service on Twitter, the company may address the issue immediately, apologize, and take action to make it right.\n", "\nSocial networking can have a big impact on the spread of misinformation. And it can spread like wildfire. This became increasingly prevalent after 2012. This information starts as rumors, which spread faster than facts. One study found that misinformation is 70% more likely to be shared than factual information on Twitter.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"5\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff\n", "\nNetworking on social media can have just as much of a detrimental impact on companies. Criticism of a brand can spread very quickly on social media. This can create a virtual headache for a company's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/public-relations-pr.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">public relations</a> department.\n", "\nAlthough social networking itself is free, building and maintaining a company profile takes hours each week. Costs for those hours add up quickly. In addition, businesses need many followers before a social media marketing campaign starts generating a positive <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnoninvestment.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">return on investment (ROI)</a>. For example, submitting a post to 15 followers does not have the same effect as submitting the post to 15,000 followers.\n", "\nAlmost every product or service you use is backed by a company that has a social media presence. It's virtually impossible to think of any major corporation that doesn't operate, market, and advertise on social networks.
