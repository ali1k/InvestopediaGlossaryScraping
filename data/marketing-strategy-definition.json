A marketing strategy contains the company\u2019s <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valueproposition.asp\">value proposition</a>, key brand messaging, data on <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/target-market.asp\">target customer</a>\u00a0demographics, and other high-level elements.\n", "\nA thorough marketing strategy covers \"<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/four-ps.asp\">the four Ps</a>\" of marketing: product, price, place, and promotion.\n", "\nA clear marketing strategy should revolve around the company's value proposition, which communicates to consumers what the company stands for, how it operates, and why it deserves their business. This provides marketing teams with a template that should inform their initiatives across all of the company's products and services. For example, Walmart (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=wmt\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">WMT: NYSE</a>) is widely known as a discount retailer with \u201ceveryday low prices,\u201d whose business operations and marketing efforts are rooted\u00a0in that idea.\n", "\nThe marketing strategy informs the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketing-plan.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">marketing plan</a>, which is a document that details the specific types of marketing activities a company conducts and contains timetables for rolling out various marketing initiatives.\n", "\nMarketing strategies should ideally have longer lifespans than individual marketing plans because they contain value propositions and other key elements of a company\u2019s brand, which generally hold constant over the long haul. In other words, marketing strategies cover big-picture messaging, while marketing plans delineate the logistical details of specific campaigns.\n", "\nAcademics continue to debate the precise meaning of marketing strategy, and so multiple definitions exist. The following quotes from industry experts help crystallize the nuances of (modern) marketing strategy:\n", "\nThe ultimate goal of a marketing strategy is to achieve and communicate a sustainable <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/competitive_advantage.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">competitive advantage</a> over rival companies by understanding the needs and wants of its consumers. Whether it's a print ad design, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/masscustomization.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mass customization</a>, or a social media campaign, a marketing asset can be judged based on how effectively it communicates a company's core value proposition.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market-research.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Market research</a> can help chart the efficacy of a given campaign and can help identify untapped audiences to achieve bottom-line goals and increase sales.\n", "\nA marketing plan helps a company direct its advertising dollars to where it will have the most impact. A 2019 study conducted by\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://coschedule.com/marketing-statistics/\" rel=\"nofollow\">CoSchedule</a>, a provider of marketing software solutions, found that firms with a documented marketing strategy were 313% more likely to report success in their marketing campaigns. The company surveyed 3,599 marketers from more than 100 countries.\n", "\nA marketing strategy will detail the advertising, outreach, and PR\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/100715/what-makes-share-coke-campaign-so-successful.asp\">campaigns</a>\u00a0to be carried out by a firm, including how the company will measure the effect of these initiatives. They will typically follow the \"four P's\". The functions and components of a marketing plan include the following:\n", "\nThe 4 P's\" are product, price, promotion, and place. These are the key factors that are involved in the marketing of a good or service. The 4 P's can be used when planning a new business venture, evaluating an existing offer, or trying to optimize sales with a target audience. It can also be used to test a current marketing strategy on a new audience.\n", "\nThe terms marketing plan and marketing strategy are often used interchangeably because a marketing plan is developed based on an overarching\u00a0strategic framework. In some cases, the strategy and the plan may be incorporated into\u00a0one document, particularly for smaller companies that may only run one or two major campaigns in a year. The plan outlines marketing activities on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis while the marketing strategy outlines the overall\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valueproposition.asp\">value proposition</a>.\n"]}
