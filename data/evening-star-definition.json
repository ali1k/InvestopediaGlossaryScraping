The opposite of the evening star is the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/morningstar.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">morning star</a> pattern, which is viewed as a bullish indicator.\n", "\nA candlestick pattern is a way of condensely presenting certain information about a stock. Specifically, it represents the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockquote.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">open, high, low, and close price</a> for the stock over a given time period.\n", "\nEach candlestick consists of a candle and two wicks. The length of the candle is a function of the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/range.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">range</a> between the highest and lowest price during that trading day. A long candle indicates a large change in price, while a short candle indicates a small change in price. In other words, long candlestick bodies are indicative of intense <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volume.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">buying or selling pressure</a>, depending on the direction of the trend, while short candlesticks are indicative of little price movement.\n", "\nThe evening star pattern is considered a very strong <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technicalindicator.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">indicator</a> of future price declines. Its pattern forms over a period of three days:\n", "\nThe evening star pattern is considered a reliable indicator that a downward trend has begun. However, it can be difficult to discern amidst the noise of stock-price data. To help identify it reliably, traders often use <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/ppo.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">price oscillators</a> and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trendline.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">trendlines</a> to confirm whether an evening star pattern has in fact occurred.\n", "\nDespite its popularity among traders, the evening star pattern is not the only <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bear.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bearish</a> indicator. Other bearish candlestick patterns include the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearishharami.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bearish harami</a>, the dark cloud cover, the shooting star, and the bearish engulfing. Different traders will have their own preferences regarding what patterns to watch for when seeking to detect trend changes.\n", "\nThe following chart provides an example of the evening star pattern:\n", "\nAs you can see, the three days depicted begin with a long white candle that indicates prices have risen from significant buying pressure. The second day also shows a rise in prices, but the extent of the increase is modest compared to the previous day. Lastly, the third day shows a long red candle in which selling pressure has forced the price to around the midpoint of the first day.\n", "\nThese are the tell-tale signs that an evening star pattern has occurred. Technical analysts trading this security would consider selling or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">shorting</a> the security in anticipation of an upcoming decline.\n"]}
