The primary characteristic of personal property is that it's movable. Examples include vehicles, boats, furniture, clothing, and smartphones.\n", "\nLand has three physical characteristics that differentiate it from other assets in the economy:\n", "\nLand also has some distinct economic characteristics that influence its value as an investment:\n", "\nThere are five main types of real estate:\n", "\nDespite the magnitude and complexity of the real estate market, many people tend to think the industry consists merely of brokers and salespeople. However, millions of people in fact earn a living through real estate, not only in sales but also in appraisals, property management, financing, construction, development, counseling, education, and several other fields.\n", "\nMany professionals and businesses\u2014including accountants, architects, banks, title insurance companies, surveyors, and lawyers\u2014also depend on the real estate industry.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/mortages-real-estate/11/factors-affecting-real-estate-market.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Real estate is a critical driver </a>of economic growth in the U.S. In fact, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/housingstarts.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">housing starts</a>\u2014the number of new residential construction projects in any given month\u2014released by the U.S. Census Bureau is a key economic indicator.

Unlike other investments, real estate is dramatically affected by its location. Factors such as employment rates, the local economy, crime rates, transportation facilities, school quality, municipal services, and property taxes can drive real estate prices up or down.\n", "\nYou can invest in real estate indirectly, as well. One of the most popular ways to do so is through a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reit.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">real estate investment trust</a> (REIT)\u2014a company that holds a portfolio of income-producing real estate. There are several broad types of REITs, including equity, mortgage, and hybrid REITs. REITs are further classified based on how their shares are bought and sold:\n", "\nThe most popular way to invest in a REIT is to buy shares that are publicly traded on an exchange. Since the shares trade like any other security traded on an exchange (think stocks), it makes REITs very liquid and transparent.\n", "\nLike many stocks, you earn income from REITs through dividend payments and appreciation of the shares.

However, MBS are still in existence and traded.\n", "\nThe most accessible way for the average investor to buy into these products is via\u00a0ETFs. Like all investments, these products carry a degree of risk. However, they may also offer portfolio diversification. Investors must investigate the holdings to ensure the funds specialize in investment-grade mortgage-backed securities, not the subprime variety that figured in the crisis.\n", "\nTwo popular ETFs that give ordinary investors access to MBS include:\n"]}
