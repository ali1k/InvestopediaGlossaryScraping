Rather than regular fixed and floating loan interest rates being swapped, fixed and floating assets are being exchanged.\n", "\nAll swaps are <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/derivative.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">derivative</a>\u00a0contracts through which two parties\u00a0exchange financial instruments. These instruments can be almost anything, but most swaps involve cash flows based on a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/notionalprincipalamount.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">notional principal amount</a> agreed upon by both parties. As the name suggests, asset swaps involve an actual asset exchange instead of just cash flows.\n", "\nSwaps do not trade on <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exchange.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">exchanges</a>, and retail investors do not generally engage in swaps. Rather, swaps are <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otc.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">over-the-counter</a> contracts between businesses or financial institutions.\n", "\nAsset swaps can be used to overlay the fixed interest rates of bond coupons with floating rates. In that sense, they are used to transform cash flow characteristics of underlying assets and transforming them to hedge the asset's risks, whether related to currency, credit, and/or interest rates.\n", "\nTypically, an asset swap involves transactions in which the investor acquires a bond position and then enters into an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrateswap.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">interest rate swap</a> with the bank that sold them the bond. The investor pays fixed and receives floating. This transforms the fixed coupon of the bond into a LIBOR-based floating coupon.\n", "\nIt is widely used by banks\u00a0to convert their long-term fixed rate assets to a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/floatinginterestrate.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">floating rate</a> in order to match their short-term liabilities (depositor accounts).\n", "\nAnother use is to insure against loss\u00a0due to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditrisk.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">credit risk</a>, such as default or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bankruptcy.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bankruptcy</a>, of the bond's issuer. Here, the swap buyer is also buying protection.\n", "\nWhether the swap is to hedge interest rate risk or default risk, there are two separate trades that occur.\n", "\nFirst, the swap buyer purchases a bond from the swap seller in return for a full price of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/par.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">par</a> plus <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accruedinterest.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">accrued interest</a> (called the dirty price).\n", "\nNext, the two parties create a contract where the buyer agrees to pay fixed coupons to the swap seller equal to the fixed rate coupons received from the bond. In return, the swap buyer receives variable rate payments of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/libor.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LIBOR</a> plus (or minus) an agreed-upon fixed spread. The <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maturity.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">maturity</a> of this swap is the same as the maturity of the asset.\n", "\nThe mechanics are the same for the swap buyer wishing to hedge <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/default2.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">default</a> or some other event risk. Here, the swap buyer is essentially buying protection and the swap seller is also selling that protection.\n", "\nAs before, the swap seller (protection seller) will agree to pay the swap buyer (protection buyer) LIBOR plus (or minus) a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spread.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">spread</a> in return for the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashflow.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cash flows</a> of the risky bond (the bond itself does not change hands). In the event of default, the swap buyer will continue to receive LIBOR plus (or minus) the spread from the swap seller. In this way, the swap buyer has transformed its original risk profile by changing both its interest rate and credit risk exposure.\n", "\nThere are two components used in calculating the spread for an asset swap. The first one is the value of coupons of underlying assets minus par swap rates. The second component is a comparison between bond prices and par values to determine the price that the investor has to pay over the lifetime of the swap. The difference between these two components is the asset swap spread paid by the protection seller to the swap buyer.\n", "\nSuppose an investor buys a bond at a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dirtyprice.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">dirty price</a> of 110% and wants to hedge the risk of a default by the bond issuer. She contacts a bank for an asset swap. The bond's fixed coupons are 6% of par value. The swap rate is 5%. Assume that the investor has to pay 0.5% price premium during the swap's lifetime. Then the asset swap spread is 0.5% (6 - 5 - 0.5). Hence the bank pays the investor LIBOR rates plus 0.5% during the swap's lifetime.\n"]}
