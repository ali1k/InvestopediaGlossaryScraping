Although BPO originally applied solely to manufacturing entities, such as soft drink manufacturers that outsourced large segments of their\u00a0supply chains, BPO now applies to the outsourcing of services, as well.\n", "\nMany businesses, from small startups to large companies, opt to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/082815/unintended-consequences-outsourcing.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">outsource</a> processes, as new and innovative services are increasingly available in today's ever-changing, highly competitive business climate.\n", "\nBroadly speaking, companies adopt BPO practices in the two main areas of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/backoffice.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">back office</a> and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/frontoffice.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">front office</a> operations. Back office BPO refers to a company contracting its core business support operations such as accounting, payment processing, IT services, human resources, regulatory compliance, and quality assurance to outside professionals who ensure the business runs smoothly.\ufeff\n", "\nBy contrast,\u00a0front office BPO tasks commonly include customer-related services such as\u00a0tech support, sales,\u00a0and marketing.\n", "\n\ufeffThe breadth of a business' BPO options depends on whether it contracts its operations within or outside the borders of its home country. BPO is deemed \"offshore outsourcing\" if the contract is sent to another country where there is political stability, lower labor costs, and/or tax savings. A U.S. company using an offshore BPO vendor in Singapore is one such example of offshore outsourcing.\n", "\nBPO is referred to as \"nearshore outsourcing\" if the job is contracted to a neighboring country. Such would be the case if a U.S. company partnered with a BPO vendor located in Canada.\n", "\nA third option, known as \"onshore outsourcing\" or \"domestic sourcing,\" occurs when BPO is contracted within the company\u2019s own country, even if its vendor partners are located in different cities or states.\n", "\nBPO is often referred to as information technology-enabled services (ITES) because it relies on technology/infrastructure that enables external companies to efficiently perform their roles.\n", "\nCompanies are often drawn to BPO because it affords them greater operational flexibility. By outsourcing non-core and administrative functions, companies can reallocate\u00a0time and resources to core competencies like customer relations and product leadership, which ultimately results in advantages over competing businesses in its industry.\n", "\nBPO offers businesses access to innovative technological\u00a0resources that they might not otherwise\u00a0have\u00a0exposure to. BPO partners and companies constantly strive to improve their processes by adopting the most recent technologies and practices.\n", "\nSince the U.S. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corporatetax.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">corporate income tax</a> is among the highest in the developed world, American companies benefit from outsourcing operations to countries with lower income taxes and cheaper labor forces as viable cost reduction measures.\n", "\nBPO also offers companies the benefits of quick and accurate reporting,\u00a0improved productivity, and the\u00a0ability to swiftly reassign its resources, when necessary.\n", "\nWhile there are many advantages of BPO, there are also disadvantages. A business that outsources its business processes may be prone to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/data-breach.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">data breaches</a> or have communication issues that delay project completion, and such businesses may underestimate the running costs\u00a0of BPO providers.\n"]}
