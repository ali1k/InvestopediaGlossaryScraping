As an example, if interest rates are rising and bond prices are falling, an investor may sell their low paying bonds and buy higher-paying bonds or hold onto the cash and wait for an even better rate of return.\n", "\nA three-year <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurynote.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Treasury note</a> might pay a 2% interest rate, a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/10-yeartreasury.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">10-year treasury note</a> might pay a 4% interest rate and a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/30-yeartreasury.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">30-year treasury</a> bond might pay a 6% interest rate.
