The accidental death benefit is usually paid in addition to the standard benefit payable if the insured died of natural causes.\n", "\nDepending on the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/issuer.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">issuer</a> of the policy, an accidental death benefit may extend up to a year after the initial accident occurs, provided the accident led to the insured's death.\n", "\nAccidental death benefits are riders or provisions that may be added to basic <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lifeinsurance.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">life insurance</a> policies at the request of the insured party. Some people choose to add accidental death benefit riders to their policies to protect their beneficiaries if an accident ever occurs. This is important as accidents are hard to predict and can leave family members in a bind when sudden death occurs.\n", "\nThese death benefits are even more important for people\u00a0who work in or around potentially hazardous environments. Even those who drive more than average\u2014either professionally or as a commuter\u2014should consider accidental death benefit riders.\n", "\nAs an optional feature, the insured party must pay an additional fee on top of their regular <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/premium.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">premiums</a> to purchase this benefit. Although it may come at an additional cost, the accidental death benefit increases the payout to a policy's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beneficiary.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">beneficiary</a>. This means that the beneficiary receives the death benefit paid by the policy itself plus any additional accidental death benefit covered by the rider. These riders typically end once the insured person reaches\u00a0age\u00a070.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurance.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Insurance</a> companies define accidental death as an event that strictly occurs as a result of an accident. Deaths from car crashes, slips, choking, drowning, machinery, and any other situations that can't be controlled are deemed accidental. In the case of a fatal accident, death usually must occur within a period specified in the policy.\n", "\nSome policies' accidental death benefits may also cover dismemberment\u2014total or partial loss of limbs\u2014burns, instances of paralysis, and other similar cases. These riders are called <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accidental-death-dismemberment-insurance.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">accidental death and dismemberment (AD&amp;D) insurance</a>.\n", "\nAccidents typically exclude things like acts of war and\u00a0death caused by illegal activities. Death from an illness is also excluded. Any hazardous hobbies that the insured regularly engages in\u2014race car driving, bungee jumping, or any other similar activity\u2014are specifically excluded as well.\n", "\nIn this type of arrangement, the\u00a0accidental death benefit\u00a0plan is included as part of a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/group-life-insurance.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">group life insurance</a> contract, such as those offered by your employer. The benefit amount is usually the same as that of the group life benefit.\n", "\nThis accidental death benefit\u00a0plan is offered to members of a group as a separate, elective benefit. Offered by your employer, premiums are your responsibility. You generally pay these premiums through regular payroll deductions. Employees are covered for accidents that occur while on the job. Policies pay out benefits for <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/voluntary-life-insurance.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">voluntary accident insurance</a> even if the insured party isn't at work.\n", "\nThe accidental death\u00a0benefit plan in this arrangement is provided through an employee benefit plan and provides supplemental accident protection to workers while they are traveling on company business. Unlike voluntary accident insurance, the employer usually pays the entire premium for this coverage.\n", "\nSome group accidental death benefit\u00a0plans also provide coverage for <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dependent.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">dependents</a>.\n", "\nAs a\u00a0hypothetical example, assume Derrick\u00a0has\u00a0a $500,000 life insurance policy with a $1 million\u00a0accidental death benefit rider.\u00a0If Derrick\u00a0dies due to a heart attack\u2014a natural cause\u2014the insurance company will pay his\u00a0beneficiary $500,000.\u00a0If he\u00a0dies as a result of a car accident, his\u00a0beneficiary will\u00a0receive the $500,000 life insurance benefit plus the $1 million\u00a0accidental death\u00a0benefit for a\u00a0total <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/payout.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">payout</a> of $1.5 million.\n"]}
