The risk of damage or loss to the goods being transported\u00a0transfers\u00a0from\u00a0the seller to\u00a0the buyer as soon as the goods are delivered to the carrier or appointed person. It is comparable, but different to Cost, Insurance, and Freight (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cif.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CIF</a>).\n", "\nUnder CIP, the\u00a0seller is\u00a0obligated\u00a0to insure goods in transit for 110% of the contract value. If the buyer desires additional insurance, such extra coverage must be arranged by the buyer.\n", "\nCarriage and Insurance Paid To (CIP)\u00a0is one of 11\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incoterms.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Incoterms</a>,\u00a0a series of\u00a0globally accepted commercial\u00a0trade terms\u00a0most recently published in 2010 by the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/international-chamber-of-commerce-icc.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">International Chamber of Commerce</a>.\n", "\nCarriage and Insurance Paid To (CIP) is typically used in conjunction with a destination. So, for example, CIP New York means the seller pays freight and insurance charges to New York.\u00a0As is the case with \u201cCarriage Paid To\u201d (CPT), carriage or freight charges with CIP refer to transportation charges for any accepted mode of transport,\u00a0such as road, rail, sea, inland waterway, air, or multimodal transport that involves a combination thereof.\n", "\nFor further context, consider this theoretical scenario: LG\u00a0in South Korea\u00a0wants to ship\u00a0a container of tablet computers to Best Buy\u00a0in the United States. Under CIP, LG\u00a0is responsible for all freight costs and minimum insurance coverage\u00a0to deliver the tablet computers to\u00a0the carrier or appointed person for Best Buy at\u00a0an agreed-upon destination. Once the shipment is delivered to\u00a0the carrier or appointed person for Best Buy, LG's\u00a0(the seller) obligation is complete, and Best Buy (the buyer) assumes full risk and responsibility for the shipment.\n", "\nSince the seller is\u00a0only obligated to purchase\u00a0the minimum amount of insurance coverage to transport\u00a0the shipment to the destination, the buyer should consider\u00a0arranging\u00a0additional coverage that protects the shipment from all risks. Otherwise, the buyer may have to bear huge losses if the shipment is damaged or lost through some adverse event that is not covered by the minimal insurance coverage provided by the seller.\n", "\nThe buyer may also\u00a0ask the seller to provide extra insurance coverage and\u2014depending on the relative bargaining positions of the buyer and seller\u2014can negotiate for the seller to bear part or all of the cost of such additional insurance.\n"]}
