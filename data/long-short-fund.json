These funds often use several alternative investing techniques such as leverage, derivatives and short positions to purchases relatively undervalued securities and sell overvalued ones.\n", "\nLong/short funds may also be referred to as enhanced funds or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/130-30_strategy.asp\">130/30 funds</a>.\n", "\nLong/short funds typically seek to enhance the returns from investing in a specific market segment by actively taking both long and short positions in securities. Long/short funds use varying active management techniques to determine portfolio holdings. They may also use leverage, derivatives and short positions which can increase the risks of the fund as well as the fund\u2019s potential total return.\n", "\nLong/short funds represent some similarities to hedge funds. They seek to offer investment strategies with greater risk and greater return potential over standard benchmarks. Most long/short funds feature higher\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp\">liquidity</a>\u00a0than hedge funds, no lock-in periods and lower fees. However, they still have higher fees and less liquidity than most mutual funds.

Long/short funds are more closely regulated than hedge funds therefore they have limitations on the use of leverage and derivatives where hedge funds do not.\n", "\nLong/short funds can be a good investment for investors seeking targeted index exposure with some active management. Long/short funds also offer the advantage of hedging against changing market environments and other trends that active management can account for.\n", "\nThe most common long/short strategy is to be long 130% and short 30% (130 - 30 = 100%) of assets under management.To engage in a 130-30 strategy, an\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investment-manager.asp\">investment manager</a>\u00a0might rank the stocks used in the S&amp;P 500 from best to worse on expected return, as signaled by past performance. A manager will use a number of data sources and rules for ranking individual stocks. Typically stocks are ranked according to a selection criteria (for example, total returns, risk-adjusted performance or relative strength) over a designated look-back period of six months or one year. The stocks are then ranked best to worst.\n", "\nFrom the best ranking stocks, the manager would invest 100% of the portfolio's value and short sell the bottom ranking stocks, up to 30% of the portfolio's value.
