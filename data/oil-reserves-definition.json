BP currently estimates that the South and Central America region has enough oil reserves to last for 136 years at current production levels.\n", "\nHowever, the volume of oil reserves does not necessarily translate into production figures. For example, Venezuela's share of the overall oil production market has crashed in recent years due to internal strife. According to the 2019 BP Statistical Review of World Energy, the South American nation accounted for just 1.6% of overall production volumes, despite having the world's largest oil reserves.\n", "\nThe other important data is the persistent downtrend in Middle Eastern oil reserves relative to production. In the 1980s, Middle Eastern countries had R/P ratios similar to what South and Central America enjoy today. Over the last 30 years, this ratio has consistently deteriorated as production rates increase and reserves become harder to find. Reserves-to-production for the Middle East now stands at roughly 80 years.\u00a0\n", "\nA similar, yet not as pronounced, trend of a downward sloping R/P is happening in the U.S., which has aggressively increased production over the last several years. The R/P for the U.S. is roughly 30 years.\u00a0\n"]}
