It represents ownership of a number of shares of stock in a foreign company that the bank holds in trust.\n", "\nInternational depository receipts are more often known in the U.S. as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/adr.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">American depository receipts</a> (ADRs). In Europe, they are known as Global Depository Receipts and trade on the London, Luxembourg, and Frankfurt exchanges.\n", "\nThe acronym IDR also is used to identify Indian Depository Receipts.\n", "\nIDRs are purchased by investors as an alternative to the direct purchase of foreign stocks on foreign exchanges. For example, American traders can buy shares of the Swiss bank Credit Suisse Group AG or Swedish automaker Volvo AB directly from American exchanges via ADRs.\n", "\nFor the companies, the IDR makes it easier and cheaper to reach international buyers.

Arbitrage is the simultaneous purchase and sale of an asset with the aim of profiting from an imbalance in the price on various exchanges and various currencies. The trade exploits the price differences of identical or near-identical financial instruments. Arbitrage can exist as a result of market <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inefficientmarket.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">inefficiencies</a>.\n", "\nThe regulatory body for the capital markets of India, the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sebi.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Securities and Exchange Board of India</a> (SEBI), issued new guidelines in 2019 for companies listing depository receipts.
