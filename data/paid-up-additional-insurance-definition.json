For some, the paid-up additions rider allows you to contribute as much or as little as you want from year to year. Other companies stipulate that contributions remain at consistent levels, or you might risk losing the rider and be forced to reapply for it in the future.\n", "\nOnly member-owned\u00a0mutual insurance companies\u00a0issue dividends.

The attained\u00a0age of the insured will determine the face value of the new policy. As a result, the death benefit is smaller than that of the lapsed policy.\n", "\nA policyholder can opt to roll the cash value of their whole life policy into paid-up insurance. In such a scenario the policy is not necessarily\u00a0paid up in the strict definition of the term, but it is capable of making its own premium payments. Depending on the type of policy and how well it has performed, a policyholder\u00a0may have to resume\u00a0premium payments in the future, or it may reach a point where the premiums are covered for the rest of the life of the policy.\n", "\nConsider a 45-year-old male who\u00a0purchases a whole life policy with an\u00a0annual base premium of $2,000 for a\u00a0$100,000 death benefit.
