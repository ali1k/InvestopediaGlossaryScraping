In cases where a subsidiary is 100% owned by another firm, the subsidiary is referred to as a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/whollyownedsubsidiary.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">wholly owned subsidiary</a>.

Still, subsidiaries\u00a0are separate and distinct legal entities from their parent companies, which reflects\u00a0in the independence of\u00a0their liabilities, taxation, and governance. If a parent company owns a subsidiary in a foreign land, the subsidiary must follow the laws of the country where it is incorporated and operates.\n", "\nHowever, given their controlling interest parent companies often have considerable influence with their <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/032615/what-difference-between-subsidiary-and-wholly-owned-subsidiary.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">subsidiaries</a>.

If the stake is less than that, the firm is considered an\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/associate-company.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">associate</a> or affiliate company. When it comes to financial reporting, an associate is treated differently than a subsidiary.\n", "\nA subsidiary usually prepares independent financial statements. Typically, these are sent to the parent, which will aggregate them\u2014as it does financials from all its operations\u2014and\u00a0carry them on its consolidated financial statements. In contrast, an associate company's financials are not combined with the parents. Instead, the parent registers the value of its stake in the associate as an asset on its <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancesheet.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">balance sheet</a>.\n", "\nAs is common practice and per the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Securities and Exchange Commission</a>\u00a0(SEC), public companies should generally consolidate all majority-owned firms or subsidiaries. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consolidation.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Consolidation</a> is typically seen as a more meaningful method of accounting than providing separate financials for a parent company and each of its subsidiaries.\u00a0\n", "\nFor example, eBay reported total revenue on its consolidated income statement, for the year ended Dec. 31, 2017, totaling US$9.6 billion. The e-commerce firm\u00a0notes in the annual report that the individual domestic and consolidated subsidiary,\u00a0StubHub, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/news/ebay-inc-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2017-results/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">generated revenue of $307 million</a>.\n", "\nThe SEC states that only in rare cases, such as when a subsidiary is undergoing bankruptcy, should a majority-owned subsidiary not be consolidated.

Ownership of such firms is typically treated as an equity investment and denoted as an asset on the parent company's balance sheet. For regulatory reasons, unconsolidated subsidiary firms are typically those in which parent firms do not have a significant stake.\n", "\nThere are advantages and disadvantages to the subsidiary structure.\n", "\nSubsidiaries can contain and limit problems for a parent company. Potential losses to the parent company can be limited by using the subsidiary as a kind of liability shield against financial losses or lawsuits. Entertainment companies often set individual movies, or TV shows up as separate subsidiaries for this reason.\n", "\nThe subsidiary structure can also offer tax advantages: They may only be subject to taxes in their state or country, versus having to pay for all the parent's profits.\n", "\nSubsidiaries can be the experimental ground for different organizational structures, manufacturing techniques, and types of products. Fashion-industry companies often have a variety of brands or labels, each set up as a subsidiary.

Aggregating and consolidating a subsidiary's financials make a parent's accounting more complicated and complex.\n", "\nSince subsidiaries must remain independent to some degree, transactions with the parent may have to be \"at arm's length,\" and the parent may not have all the control it wishes. Yet the parent may also be liable for criminal actions or corporate malfeasance by the subsidiary. It may have to guarantee the subsidiary's loans, leaving it exposed to financial losses.\n", "\nPublic companies are required by the SEC to disclose significant subsidiaries under Item 601 of Regulation S-K.

The company has developed a public transportation management system that aggregates millions of data points from smartphones, cars and Wi-Fi hotspots to analyze and predict where traffic and commuters are most congregated. The system can redirect public transportation resources, such as buses, to these congested areas to keep the public transit system moving efficiently.\n", "\nFor Alphabet, Sidewalk Labs provides it with a business unit that develops technology that can one day help the entire company. Since one of Alphabet's largest products is Google Maps, subsidiaries such as Sidewalk Labs can strengthen the company's overall business operations.\n"]}
