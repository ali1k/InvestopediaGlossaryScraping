Profitability ratios are most useful when compared to similar companies, the company's own history, or average ratios for the company's industry.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/grossprofit.asp\">Gross profit</a> margin is one of the most widely used profitability or margin ratios. Gross profit is the difference between revenue and the costs of production\u2014called <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cogs.asp\">cost of goods sold </a>(COGS).\n", "\nSome industries experience <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/seasonality.asp\">seasonality</a> in their operations. For example, retailers typically experience significantly higher revenues and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earnings.asp\">earnings</a> during the year-end holiday season. Thus, it would not be useful to compare a retailer's fourth-quarter gross profit margin with its first-quarter gross profit margin because they are not directly comparable. Comparing a retailer's fourth-quarter profit margin with its fourth-quarter profit margin from the previous year would be far more informative.\n", "\nProfitability ratios are one of the most popular metrics used in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-analysis.asp\">financial analysis</a>, and they generally fall into two categories\u2014margin ratios and return ratios.\n", "\nMargin ratios give insight, from several different angles, on a company's ability to turn sales into a profit. Return ratios offer several different ways to examine how well a company generates a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/return.asp\">return</a> for its shareholders.\n", "\nSome common examples of profitability ratios are the various measures of profit margin, return on assets (ROA), and return on equity (ROE). Others include <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnoninvestmentcapital.asp\">return on invested capital</a> (ROIC) and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/roce.asp\">return on capital employed</a> (ROCE).\n", "\nDifferent <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profitmargin.asp\">profit margins</a> are used to measure a company's profitability at various cost levels of inquiry, including gross margin, operating margin, pretax margin, and net profit margin. The margins shrink as layers of additional costs are taken into consideration\u2014such as the COGS, operating expenses, and taxes.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/grossmargin.asp\">Gross margin</a> measures how much a company makes after accounting for COGS. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operatingmargin.asp\">Operating margin</a> is the percentage of sales left after covering COGS and operating expenses. The <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pretax-margin.asp\">pretax margin</a> shows a company's profitability after further accounting for non-operating expenses.

The use of the term \"return\" in the ROA measure customarily refers to net profit or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/netincome.asp\">net income</a>\u2014the value of earnings from sales after all costs, expenses, and taxes.

ROE, calculated as net income divided by shareholders' equity, may increase without additional equity investments.
