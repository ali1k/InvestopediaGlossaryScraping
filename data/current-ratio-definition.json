Analysts must also consider the quality of a company\u2019s other assets versus its obligations. If the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inventory.asp\">inventory</a> is unable to be sold, the current ratio may still look acceptable at one point in time, even though the company may be headed for default.\n", "\nA current ratio of less than one may seem alarming, although different situations can affect the current ratio in a solid company. For example, a normal monthly cycle for the company\u2019s collections and payment processes may lead to a high current ratio as payments are received, but a low current ratio as those collections ebb.\n", "\nCalculating the current ratio at just one point in time could indicate the company can\u2019t cover all its <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/030915/what-are-some-examples-current-liabilities.asp\">current debts</a>, but it doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t be able to once the payments are received.\n", "\nAdditionally, some companies, especially larger retailers such as Walmart, have been able to negotiate much longer-than-average payment terms with their suppliers.

However, while a high ratio, say over 3, could indicate the company can cover its current liabilities three times, it may also indicate that it's not using its current assets efficiently, is not securing financing very well, or is not managing its <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/workingcapital.asp\">working capital</a>.\n", "\nWhat makes the current ratio \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d often depends on how it is changing. A company that seems to have an acceptable current ratio could be trending toward a situation where it will struggle to pay its bills. Conversely, a company that may appear to be struggling now, could be making good progress toward a healthier current ratio.\n", "\nIn the first case, the trend of the current ratio over time would be expected to harm the company\u2019s valuation. An improving current ratio, meanwhile, could indicate an opportunity to invest in an undervalued stock in the midst of a turnaround.\n", "\nImagine two companies with a current ratio of 1.00 today. Based on the trend of the current ratio in the following table, which would analysts likely have more optimistic expectations for?\n", "\nTwo things should be apparent in the trend of Horn &amp; Co. vs. Claws, Inc. First, the trend for Claws is negative, which means further investigation is prudent. Perhaps it is taking on too much debt, or its cash balance is being depleted: either of which could be a solvency issue if it worsens. The trend for Horn &amp; Co. is positive, which could indicate better collections, faster <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inventoryturnover.asp\">inventory turnover</a>, or that the company has been able to pay down debt.\n", "\nThe second factor is that Claws\u2019 current ratio has been more volatile, jumping from 1.35 to 1.05 in a single year, which could indicate increased <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operational_risk.asp\">operational risk</a> and likely drag on the company\u2019s value.\n", "\nThe current ratio for three companies\u2014Apple, Walt Disney, and Costco Wholesale\u2014is calculated as follows for the fiscal year ended 2017:\n", "\nFor every $1 of current debt, Costco Wholesale had $.99 cents available to pay for the debt at the time this snapshot was taken.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\"></span> Likewise, Walt Disney had $.81 cents in current assets for each dollar of current debt.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\"></span> Apple, meanwhile, had more than enough to cover its current liabilities if they were all theoretically due immediately and all current assets could be turned into cash.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\"></span>\n", "\nOther similar liquidity ratios can be used to supplement a current ratio analysis. In each case, the differences in these measures can help an investor understand the current status of the company\u2019s assets and liabilities from different angles, as well as to understand how those accounts are changing over time.\n", "\nThe commonly used <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/acidtest.asp\">acid-test ratio</a>, or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quickratio.asp\">quick ratio</a>, compares a company\u2019s easily liquidated assets (including cash, accounts receivable, and short-term investments, excluding inventory and prepaid expenses) to its current liabilities. The cash asset ratio, or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cash-ratio.asp\">cash ratio</a>, is also similar to the current ratio, but it compares only a company\u2019s marketable securities and cash to its current liabilities.\n", "\nFinally, the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/ocfratio.asp\">operating cash flow ratio</a> compares a company\u2019s active <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cash-flow-from-operating-activities.asp\">cash flow from operations</a> (CFO) to its current liabilities.\n", "\nOne limitation of using the current ratio emerges when using the ratio to compare different companies with one another. Businesses differ substantially between industries, and so comparing the current ratios of companies across different industries may not lead to productive insight.\n", "\nFor example, in one industry it may be more typical to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trade-credit.asp\">extend credit</a> to clients for 90 days or longer, while in another industry short-term collections are more critical. Ironically, the industry that extends more credit may actually have a superficially stronger current ratio because its current assets would be higher. It is usually more useful to compare companies within the same industry.\n", "\nAnother drawback of using current ratios, briefly mentioned above, involves its lack of specificity. Unlike many other liquidity ratios, it incorporates all of a company\u2019s current assets, even those that cannot be easily liquidated. For example, imagine two companies which both have a current ratio of 0.80 at the end of the last quarter. On the surface, this may look equivalent but the quality and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/07/liquidity.asp\">liquidity</a> of those assets may be very different as shown in the following breakdown:\n", "\nIn this example, Company A has much more inventory than Company B, which will be harder to turn into cash in the short term. Perhaps this inventory is overstocked or unwanted, which may eventually reduce its value on the balance sheet. Company B has more cash, which is the most liquid asset, and more accounts receivable which could be collected more quickly than inventory can be liquidated. Although the total value of current assets matches, Company B is in a more liquid, solvent position.\n", "\nThe current liabilities of Company A and Company B are also very different. Company A has more accounts payable while Company B has a greater amount of short-term notes payable. This would be worth more investigation because it is likely that the accounts payable will have to be paid before the entire balance of the notes payable account. However, Company B does have fewer wages payable, which is the liability most likely to be paid in the short term.\n", "\nIn this example, although both companies seem similar, Company B is likely in a more liquid and solvent position. An investor can dig deeper into the details of a current ratio comparison by evaluating other liquidity ratios that are more narrowly focused than the current ratio.\n", "\nWhat counts as a \u201cgood\u201d current ratio will depend on the company\u2019s industry and historical performance. As a general rule, however, a current ratio below 1.00 could indicate that a company might struggle to meet its short-term obligations, whereas ratios of 1.50 or greater would generally indicate ample liquidity. Publicly-listed companies in the U.S. reported a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/median.asp\">median</a> current ratio of 1.69 in 2019.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"5\"></span>\n", "\nCalculating the current ratio is very straightforward. To do so, simply divide the company\u2019s current assets by its current liabilities. Current assets are those which can be converted into cash within one year, whereas current liabilities are obligations expected to be paid within one year. Examples of current assets include cash, inventory, and accounts receivable. Examples of current liabilities include accounts payable, wages payable, and the current portion of any scheduled interest or principal payments.\n", "\nA current ratio of 1.5 would indicate that the company has $1.50 of current assets for every $1.00 of current liabilities. For example, suppose a company\u2019s current assets consist of $50,000 in cash plus $100,000 in accounts receivable. Its current liabilities, meanwhile, consist of $100,000 in accounts payable. In that scenario, the company would have a current ratio of 1.5, calculated by dividing its current assets ($150,000) by its current liabilities ($100,000).\n"]}
