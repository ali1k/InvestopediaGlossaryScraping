The seller of\u00a0a weather derivative agrees to bear the\u00a0risk of disasters in return for a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/premium.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">premium</a>. If no damages occur before the expiration of the contract, the seller will make a profit\u2014and in the event of unexpected or adverse weather, the buyer of\u00a0the derivative claims the agreed amount.\n", "\nThe <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profit.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">profitability</a> and revenues of virtually every industry\u2014agriculture, energy, entertainment, construction, travel, and others\u2014depend to a great extent on the vagaries of temperature, rainfall, and storms. Unexpected weather rarely results in price adjustments that entirely make up for lost <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/revenue.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">revenue</a>, making weather derivatives, securities that allow companies to hedge against the possibility of weather that might adversely affect their business, a pivotal investment for many.\n", "\nCompanies whose business depends on the weather, such as hydro-electric businesses or those who manage sporting events,\u00a0might use weather derivatives as part of a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/what-risk-management/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">risk-management</a> strategy. Farmers, meanwhile, may use weather derivatives to hedge against a poor harvest caused by too much or too little rain,\u00a0sudden\u00a0temperature swings, or destructive winds.\n", "\nIn 1997, weather derivatives began trading <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otc.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">over-the-counter\u00a0</a>(OTC) and, within a few years, they had become an $8 billion industry tradeable on an exchange and treated by some hedge funds as an investment class. The <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cme.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chicago Mercantile Exchange</a>\u00a0(CME) lists weather futures contracts for a few dozen cities, the majority of them in the U.S.\n", "\nCME weather futures, unlike OTC contracts, are standardized contracts traded publicly on the open market in an electronic auction type of\u00a0environment, with continuous negotiation of prices and complete\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pricetransparency.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">price transparency</a>.

For example, an index might be the total rainfall over a specified period in a specific place. Another can be for the number of times the temperature falls below freezing.\u00a0\n", "\nOne climate index for weather derivatives is known as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/heatingdegreeday.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">heating degree days</a>\u00a0or HDD. Under HDD contracts, each day the daily mean temperature falls below a predetermined reference point over a specified period, the amount of the departure is recorded and added to a cumulative count. The final figure determines whether the seller pays out or receives payment.\n", "\nWeather derivatives are similar to but different from <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurance.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">insurance</a>. Insurance covers low-probability, catastrophic\u00a0weather events such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and tornadoes. In contrast, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/derivative.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">derivatives</a> cover higher-probability events such as a dryer-than-expected summer.\n", "\nInsurance does not protect against the reduction of demand resulting from a slightly wetter summer than average, for example, whereas weather derivatives can do just that.\u00a0Since weather derivatives and insurance cover two different possibilities, a company might have an interest in purchasing\u00a0both.\n", "\nAlso, since the contract is index-based, buyers of weather derivatives do not need to demonstrate a loss. In order to collect insurance, on the other hand, damage must be shown.\n", "\nOne important point that differentiates utilities/<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/investing/commodities-trading-overview/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">commodity</a>\u00a0derivatives (power, electricity, agricultural) and weather derivatives is that the former set allows hedging on price based on a specific volume, while the latter offers to hedge the actual utilization or the yield, independent of the volume.\n", "\nFor instance, one can lock the price of X barrels of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/crude-oil.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">crude oil</a> or X bushels of corn by buying oil <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futures.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">futures</a> or corn futures, respectively. But getting into weather derivatives allows hedging the overall risk for yield and utilization.\n", "\nA temperature dipping below 10 degrees will result in complete damage to wheat crop, whereas rain on weekends in Las Vegas will impact city tours. Hence, a combination of weather and commodity derivatives is best for overall risk mitigation.\n"]}
