interest rate that an investor will earn for an investment, a loan, or another product based on compounding. The AER reveals to investors what they can expect to return from an investment, meaning the actual return of the investment based on compounding, which is more than the stated or nominal interest rate.\n", "\nAssuming interest is calculated (or compounded) more than once a year,\u00a0the AER will be higher than the stated interest rate. The more compounding periods, the greater the difference between the two will be. The annual equivalent rate (AER) is also known as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/effectiveinterest.asp\">effective annual interest rate</a> or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/apy.asp\">annual percentage yield (APY)</a>.\n", "\nLet's look at AER in both savings accounts and bonds.\n", "\nAssume an investor wishes to sell all the securities in their investment portfolio and place all the proceeds in a savings account. The investor is deciding between placing the proceeds in Bank A, Bank B, or Bank C, depending on the highest rate offered. Bank A has a quoted interest rate of 3.7% that pays interest on an annual basis. Bank B has a quoted interest rate of 3.65% that pays interest quarterly, and Bank C has a quoted interest rate of 3.7% that pays interest semiannually.\n", "\nTherefore, Bank A would have an annual equivalent rate of 3.7%, or (1 + (0.037 / 1))<sup>1</sup> - 1. Bank B has an AER of 3.7% = (1 + (0.0365 / 4))<sup>4</sup> - 1, which is equivalent to that of Bank A even though Bank B is compounded quarterly. It would thus make no difference to the investor if they placed their cash in Bank A or Bank B.\n", "\nOn the other hand, Bank C has the same interest rate as Bank A, but Bank C pays interest semiannually. Consequently, Bank C has an AER of 3.73%, which is more attractive than the other two banks' AER. The calculation is (1 + (0.037 / 2))<sup>2</sup> - 1 = 3.73%.\n", "\nLet's now consider a bond issued by General Electric. As of March 2019, General Electric offers a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/noncallable.asp\">noncallable</a> semiannual coupon with a 4% coupon rate expiring December 15, 2023. The nominal, or stated rate, of the bond is 8%\u2014or the 4% coupon rate times two annual coupons. However, the annual equivalent rate is higher given the fact that interest is paid twice a year. The AER of the bond is calculated as (1+ (0.04 / 2 ))<sup>2</sup> - 1 = 8.16%.\n", "\nWhile the stated interest rate doesn't account for compounding, the AER does. The stated rate will generally be lower than AER if there's more than one compounding period. AER is used to determine which banks offer better rates and which investments might be attractive.

As well, AER doesn't include any fees that might be tied to purchasing or selling the investment. There's also the fact that compounding itself has limitations, with the maximum possible rate being continuous compounding.\n", "\nThe AER is one of the various ways to calculate interest on interest\u2014compounding. Compounding allows investors to boost their returns by making money on interest.
