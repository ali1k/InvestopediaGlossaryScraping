The human-life approach contrasts with the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/needsapproach.asp\">needs approach</a>.\n", "\nWhen using the human-life approach, it's necessary\u00a0to replace all of the income that's lost when an employed family member dies. This figure\u00a0includes\u00a0after-tax pay\u00a0and makes adjustments for expenses (like a second car) incurred while earning that income. It also considers the value of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/healthinsurance.asp\">health insurance</a> or other employee benefits.\n", "\nWhen determining the life insurance amount needed for a family, there are many important factors to consider. It is imperative to spend the appropriate time assessing the many variables involved so that a family can ensure that it will be taken care of and will not be in any sort of financial distress if a family member passes away. The following are five key steps in calculating life insurance needs for the human-life approach.\n", "\n<strong>Step One:\u00a0</strong>Estimate the insured\u2019s remaining lifetime earnings, taking\u00a0into consideration both the \u201caverage\u201d annual salary and potential future increases, which will have a significant impact on life insurance requirements.\n", "\n<strong>Step Two:\u00a0</strong>Subtract a reasonable estimate of annual <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incometax.asp\">income taxes</a> and living expenses spent on the insured. This provides\u00a0the\u00a0actual salary needed to provide for family needs, minus the presence of the insured. As a rule of thumb, this figure should be close to\u00a0about 70%\u00a0of the pre-death income, although this number may vary\u00a0from family to family, depending on\u00a0individual budgets.\n", "\n<strong>Step Three:\u00a0</strong>Determine the length of time for which earnings will need to be replaced. This time period could be\u00a0until the\u00a0insured\u2019s dependents are fully\u00a0grown, and no longer require\u00a0financial support, or until the insured's assumed\u00a0retirement age.\n", "\n<strong>Step Four:</strong><em>\u00a0</em>Select a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/discountrate.asp\">discount rate</a> for\u00a0future earnings. A conservative figure for this estimate would be\u00a0the assumed rate of return on\u00a0U.S. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurybill.asp\">Treasury bills</a> or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurynote.asp\">notes</a>. This is needed because a\u00a0life insurance company will leave a death benefit in an interest-bearing account.\n", "\n<strong>Step Five:\u00a0</strong>Multiply\u00a0the net salary needed by the length of time needed to determine the future earnings.\u00a0Then, using the assumed rate of return, figure out the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/presentvalue.asp\">present value</a> of future earnings.\n", "\nConsider a 40-year-old that makes $65,000 per year. After following the above steps, it is determined that the family needs\u00a0$48,500 per year to support itself if the 40-year old individual passes away, and must do\u00a0so until what the retirement age of the individual would have been. In this case, 25 years away till 65. Assuming\u00a0a 5%\u00a0discount rate, the present value of this 40-year-old's\u00a0future net salary over 25 years would be $683,556.\n"]}
