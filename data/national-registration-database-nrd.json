It allows security dealers and investment advisors to file registration forms electronically.\n", "\nThe NRD\u00a0increases the efficiency of the filing and sharing of information between provincial security regulators. Examples of items that need to be filed include a change in the information of a member firm and the termination of an investment advisor.\u00a0\n", "\nAn individual or company who\u00a0trades or underwrites\u00a0securities, or provides investment advice, must register annually with one or more provincial securities regulators. The goal is to protect the investing public by ensuring\u00a0that only qualified and reputable individuals and firms are licensed.\u00a0The NRD was\u00a0initiated by\u00a0the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/csa.asp\">Canadian Securities Administrators</a>\u00a0(CSA) and the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investment-industry-regulatory-organization-of-canada-iiroc.asp\">Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada</a>\u00a0(IIROC). The CSA is composed\u00a0of securities regulators from\u00a0each province and territory.\u00a0\n", "\nOn the CSA website, investors can search for a company or individual to check if they are registered before they invest. The NRD has two websites; the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"http://nrd-info.ca/\" rel=\"nofollow\">NRD Information Website</a>, which contains information for the public, and the\u00a0National Registration Database\u00a0for use by authorized representatives.\n", "\nSecurities regulators recognized that\u00a0the registration process could be drastically improved\u00a0by introducing\u00a0an electronic system that would\u00a0replace the existing paper-based system.\u00a0A national web-based registration system could help the CSA achieve its\u00a0long-term goals of easing the regulatory burden for\u00a0capital market participants\u00a0and\u00a0harmonizing\u00a0securities regulations across jurisdictions.\n", "\nA study commissioned by the CSA\u00a0in 2001 estimated the total economic benefits of NRD to the Canadian financial services industry would be\u00a0$85 million over a five year period.\u00a0\n", "\nThe study also found that most of the gains would be realized as a result of efficiency gains. For example, the registration process would provide cash benefits to firms, lower labor costs, and save time.\u00a0Large firms hoped to gain over 50% of the $85 million projected benefits, and small firms hoped to benefit on a per registrant basis to a greater extent than large firms. Small firms expected benefits equal to $2,200 per registrant compared to $264 for each large firm registrant.\n", "\nTo register with the NRD, firms must pay a fee when they initially register. Firms and individuals\u00a0must also pay a fee if they\u00a0register\u00a0in an additional jurisdiction or want to reactivate\u00a0registration. The fee is\u00a0$75 for each Form 33-109F4, which must be submitted for each individual or firm applying for registration\u00a0and\u00a0$20.50 for each Form 33-109F4, which must be submitted for each individual applying for registration in each additional jurisdiction.\n"]}
