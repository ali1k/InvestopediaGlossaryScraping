The fee paid to an underwriter often takes the form of a commission, premium, spread, or interest. Underwriters play a critical role in many industries in the financial world, including the mortgage industry, insurance industry, equity markets, and\u00a0some common types of debt security trading. An individual in the position of a lead underwriter is sometimes called a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bookrunner.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">book runner</a>.\n", "\nThe term underwriter first emerged in the early days of marine insurance. Shipowners sought insurance for a ship and its\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www.referenceforbusiness.com/knowledge/Cargo.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">cargo</a>\u00a0to protect themselves in the event that the ship and its contents were lost. Shipowners would prepare a document that described their ship, its contents, crew, and destination.\n", "\nBusinessmen who wished to assume some of the obligation or risk would sign their name at the bottom and indicate how much exposure they were willing to assume. An agreed-upon rate and terms were set out in the paper. These businessmen became known as underwriters.\n", "\nModern-day underwriters play a variety of roles depending\u00a0on the industry they are working in. In general, underwriters are tasked with determining the level of the risk involved in a transaction or other kind of business decision. Risk is the likelihood that an outcome or investment's actual gains will differ from an expected outcome or\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/roys-safety-first-criterion.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">return</a>.\n", "\nInvestors rely on underwriters\u00a0because they determine if a business risk is worth taking. Underwriters also contribute to\u00a0sales-type activities; for example, in the case of an\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ipo.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">initial public offering (IPO)</a>, the underwriter might purchase the entire IPO issue and sell it to investors. An IPO is the process whereby a company that was previously privately-owned selling shares of a previously private company on a public stock exchange for the first time.\n", "\nThe most common type of underwriter is a mortgage loan underwriter. Mortgage loans are approved based on a combination of an applicant's income, credit history, debt ratios, and overall savings.\n", "\nMortgage loan underwriters ensure that a loan applicant meets all of these requirements, and they subsequently approve or deny a loan. Underwriters also review a property's appraisal to ensure\u00a0that\u00a0it is accurate and the home is worth the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/purchaseprice.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">purchase price</a> and loan amount.\n", "\nMortgage loan underwriters have final approval for all mortgage loans. Loans that are not approved can go through an appeal process, but the decision requires overwhelming evidence to be overturned.\n", "\nInsurance underwriters, much like mortgage underwriters, review applications for coverage and accept or reject an applicant based on risk analysis. Insurance brokers and other entities submit insurance applications on behalf of clients, and insurance underwriters review the application and decide whether or not to offer insurance coverage.\n", "\nAdditionally, insurance underwriters advise on risk management issues, determine available coverage for specific individuals, and review existing clients for continued coverage analysis.\n", "\nIn the equity markets, underwriters\u00a0administer\u00a0the public issuance and distribution of securities\u2014in the form of common or preferred stock\u2014from a corporation or other issuing body. Perhaps the most prominent\u00a0role of an equity underwriter\u00a0is\u00a0in\u00a0the IPO\u00a0process.\u00a0\n", "\nIPO underwriters are financial specialists who\u00a0work\u00a0closely with the issuing body to determine the initial\u00a0offering price of the\u00a0securities, buy the securities from the issuer, and sell the securities to investors via the underwriter's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/distribution-network.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">distribution network</a>.\n", "\nIPO underwriters are typically\u00a0investment banks that have IPO specialists on staff. These investment banks work with a company to ensure that all regulatory requirements are satisfied. The IPO specialists contact a large network of investment organizations\u2014such as mutual funds and insurance companies\u2014to gauge investment interest. The amount of interest received by these large institutional investors helps an underwriter set the IPO price of the company's stock. The underwriter also guarantees that a specific number of shares will be sold at that initial price and will purchase any surplus.\n", "\nUnderwriters purchase debt securities\u2014such as government bonds, corporate bonds, municipal bonds, or preferred stock\u2014from the issuing body (usually a company or government agency)\u00a0to resell them for a\u00a0profit. This profit is\u00a0known as the \"underwriting spread.\"\n", "\nAn\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/020915/how-do-i-become-underwriter.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">underwriter</a>\u00a0may\u00a0resell\u00a0debt securities\u00a0either directly to the marketplace or to dealers (who will then sell them to other buyers). When the issuance of a\u00a0debt security\u00a0requires more than one underwriter, the resulting\u00a0group of underwriters\u00a0is known as an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underwriter-syndicate.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">underwriter syndicate</a>.\n"]}
