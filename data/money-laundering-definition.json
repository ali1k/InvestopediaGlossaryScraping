The money from the criminal activity is considered dirty, and the process \"launders\" it to make it look clean.\n", "\nMoney laundering is a serious financial crime that is employed by white collar and street-level criminals alike.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff Most financial companies have<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aml.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> anti-money-laundering (AML)</a> policies in place to detect and prevent this activity.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nMoney laundering is essential for criminal organizations that wish to use\u00a0illegally obtained money effectively.\u00a0Dealing in large amounts of illegal cash is inefficient and dangerous. Criminals need a way to deposit the money in legitimate <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financialinstitution.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">financial institutions</a>, yet they can only do so if it appears to come from legitimate sources.\n", "\nThe process of laundering money typically involves three steps: placement, layering, and integration.\n", "\nThere are many ways to launder money, from the simple to the very complex. One of the most common techniques is to use a legitimate, cash-based business owned by a criminal organization. For example, if the organization owns a restaurant, it might inflate the daily cash receipts to funnel illegal cash through the restaurant and into the restaurant's bank account. After that, the funds can be withdrawn as needed. These types of businesses are often referred to as \"fronts.\"\n", "\nIn one common form of money laundering, called <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smurf.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">smurfing</a> (also known as \"structuring\"), the criminal breaks up large chunks of cash into multiple small deposits, often spreading them over many different accounts, to avoid detection. Money laundering can also be accomplished through the use of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currency-exchange.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">currency exchanges</a>, wire transfers, and \"mules\"\u2014cash smugglers, who sneak large amounts of cash across borders and deposit them in foreign accounts, where money-laundering enforcement is less strict.\n", "\nOther money-laundering methods involve investing in commodities such as gems and gold that can easily be moved to other jurisdictions, discreetly investing in and selling valuable assets such as real estate, gambling, counterfeiting; and using <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shellcorporation.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">shell companies</a> (inactive companies or corporations that essentially exist on paper only).\n", "\nThe Internet has put a new spin on the old crime. The rise of online banking institutions, anonymous online payment services and peer-to-peer (P2P) transfers with mobile phones have made detecting the illegal transfer of money even more difficult. Moreover, the use of proxy servers and anonymizing software makes the third component of money laundering, integration, almost impossible to detect\u2014money can be transferred or withdrawn leaving little or no trace of an IP address.\n", "\nMoney can also be laundered through online auctions and sales, gambling websites, and virtual gaming sites, where ill-gotten money is converted into gaming currency, then back into real, usable, and untraceable \"clean\" money.\n", "\nThe newest frontier of money laundering involves <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cryptocurrency.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cryptocurrencies</a>, such as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bitcoin.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bitcoin.</a> While not totally anonymous, they are increasingly being used in blackmail schemes, the drug trade, and other criminal activities due to their relative anonymity compared with more conventional forms of currency.\n", "\nAnti-money-laundering laws (AML) have been slow to catch up to these types of cybercrimes, since most of the laws are still based on detecting dirty money as it passes through traditional banking institutions.\n", "\nGovernments around the world have stepped up their efforts to combat money laundering in recent decades, with regulations that require financial institutions to put systems in place to detect and report suspicious activity. The amount of money involved is substantial. According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, global money laundering transactions account for roughly $800 billion to $2 trillion annually, or some 2% to 5% of global GDP.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"9\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nIn 1989, the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/g7.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Group of Seven (G-7)</a> formed an international committee called the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-action-task-force-fatf.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Financial Action Task Force (FATF)</a> in an attempt to fight money laundering on an international scale.
