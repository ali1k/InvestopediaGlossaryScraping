It superseded the 1947 <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gatt.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade</a> (GATT) created in the wake of World War II.\n", "\nThe WTO is based on agreements signed by the majority of the world\u2019s trading nations. The main function of the organization is to help producers of goods and services, exporters, and importers protect and manage their businesses. As of 2021, the WTO has <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/org6_e.htm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">164 member countries</a>, with Liberia and Afghanistan the most recent members, having joined in July 2016, and 23 \u201cobserver\u201d<em> </em>countries.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nThe WTO is essentially <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/investing/what-is-the-world-trade-organization/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">an alternative dispute or mediation entity</a> that upholds\u00a0the international rules of trade among nations. The organization provides a platform that allows member governments to negotiate and resolve\u00a0trade issues with other members. The WTO\u2019s main focus is to provide open lines of communication concerning trade between its members.\n", "\nFor example, the WTO has\u00a0lowered trade barriers and increased trade among\u00a0member countries. On the other hand, it has also maintained trade barriers when it makes\u00a0sense to do so in the global context. Therefore, the WTO attempts to provide negotiation mediation that benefits\u00a0the global\u00a0economy.\n", "\nOnce negotiations are complete and an agreement is in place, the WTO then offers to interpret that agreement in the event of a future dispute. All WTO agreements include a settlement process, whereby the organization legally conducts neutral conflict resolution.\n", "\nOn February 15, 2021 the WTO's General Council selected two-time Nigerian finance minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala as its director-general. She is the first woman and the first African to be selected for the position. She took office on March 1, 2021 and her term will end in August 2025.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"6\"></span><span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"5\"></span>\n", "\nNo negotiation, mediation, or resolution would be possible without the foundational WTO agreements.

They bind a country\u2019s government to a set of constraints that must be observed when\u00a0setting future trade policies. These agreements\u00a0protect producers, importers, and exporters\u00a0while encouraging world governments to meet specific social and environmental standards.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\"></span>\n", "\nThe history of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/011916/brief-history-international-trade-agreements.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">international trade</a> has been a battle between <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/protectionism.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">protectionism</a> and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/free-trade.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">free trade</a>, and the WTO has fueled globalization with both positive and adverse effects.

Skeptics\u00a0believe that the WTO undermines the principles of organic democracy and widens the international wealth gap. They point to the decline in domestic industries and increasing\u00a0foreign influence as negative impacts on the world economy.\n", "\nAs part of his broader attempts to renegotiate U.S. international trade deals, when he was in office, President Trump threatened to withdraw from the WTO, calling it a \u201cdisaster.\u201d A U.S. withdrawal from the WTO could have disrupted trillions of dollars in global trade, however, he didn't withdraw from it during this time in office.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n"]}
