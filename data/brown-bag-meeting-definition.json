This type of meeting is referred to as a brown bag meeting or a brown bag seminar because participants typically bring their lunches, which are associated with being packed in brown paper bags.\n", "\nMeetings of this kind usually occur in office training or conference rooms. They don't necessarily have to be held during the lunch hour and can take place at any time during the workday or after hours.\n", "\nBrown bag meetings are informal training and learning sessions offered by employers to their staff. These meetings are also called lunch and learn sessions.\n", "\nThe brown bag meeting is an efficient and straightforward way for\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corporation.asp\">corporations</a>\u00a0to save money while training or informing staff. The underlying assumption is that employees will bring their own lunch to the meeting. Formal meetings are usually catered or held offsite, with the company assuming all dining costs.\u00a0Depending on the number of attendees, these costs can be significant.\u00a0\n", "\nOther organizations, such as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/non-profitorganization.asp\">nonprofits</a> and academic institutions, also offer brown bag meetings. These meetings are usually informative, range from one to four hours, and have a small number of participants.\n", "\nThere are four primary types of brown bag meetings. These types include the seminar, small group, combination, and the social meeting.\n", "\nA seminar meeting is the most common, and usually includes a guest speaker or expert who transfers their knowledge and experience about a specific topic to the gathering. This format often includes a short question-and-answer period at the end of the session.\n", "\nIn a small group meeting, each participant answers a single question or a set of pre-defined questions. Other attendees may comment, ask for more information or clarity, and discuss the responses. The process continues until all participants answer the topic questions. This format allows for the maximum transfer of knowledge and experience and reinforces group dynamics. Small group meetings are frequently referred\u00a0to as workshops.\n", "\nA combination meeting is a hybrid of a seminar and a\u00a0small group meeting. The meeting starts with a speaker presenting a key topic for the meeting. The remaining time is spent operating in a small group format. The small group format is useful for problem-solving, brainstorming, and team-building. The attendees will frequently reconvene and each small group will present its findings to the group at large.\n", "\nThe social meeting type allows participants the opportunity to get to know each other in a relaxed setting. Participants may learn each person\u2019s role and career objectives. This format builds trust and promotes cohesiveness.\n", "\nThese meetings can also be helpful in disseminating topics not specifically related to work but that can be useful for employees. These include healthy living, investing, retirement options, technology-related topics, and safety outside the workplace.\n", "\nSimply put, there is no limit to what employers can cover during these informal meetings.\n", "\nBrown bag meetings promote dialogue and information sharing among participants. Sharing among participants enhances training and ensures consistent dissemination of information.\n", "\nThey also promote teamwork, reinforce company values and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/missionstatement.asp\">missions</a>, and increase employee morale. They can also help employees learn about and develop important skills they can use outside the workplace.\n", "\nThe sessions can be structured or unstructured, and are often used to transfer knowledge, solve problems, brainstorm, and build trust among attendees.\n", "\nMeetings may include presentations. They may also be led by speakers who provide expert advice, discuss policy changes, or talk about\u00a0innovative products and services. Brown bag meetings are useful for cross-training, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/project-management.asp\">project management</a> initiatives, and cross-functional team meetings.\n"]}
