Balance of trade is the largest component of a country's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bop.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">balance of payments</a> (BOP). Sometimes the balance of trade between a country's goods and the balance of trade between its services are distinguished as two separate figures.\n", "\nThe balance of trade is also referred to as the trade balance, the international trade balance, commercial balance, or the net exports.\n", "\nThe formula for calculating the BOT can be simplified as the total value of exports minus the total value of its imports.\u00a0Economists use the BOT to measure the relative strength of a country's economy. A country that imports more goods and services\u00a0than it exports in terms of value has a trade deficit or a negative trade balance. Conversely, a country that exports more goods and services than it imports has a trade surplus or a positive trade balance.\n", "\nThere are countries where it is almost certain that a trade deficit will occur. For example, the United States, where actually, a trade deficit is not a recent occurrence. In fact, the country has had a persistent trade deficit since the 1970s. Throughout most of the 19th century, the country also had a trade deficit (between 1800 and 1870, the United States ran a trade deficit for all but three years).<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff Conversely, China's trade surplus has increased even as the pandemic has reduced global trade. In July 2020, China generated a $110 billion surplus in manufactured goods off $230 billion in exports\u2014so even counting imported parts, China is getting close to exporting $2 worth of manufactured goods for every manufactured good it imports.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nA trade surplus or deficit\u00a0is not always\u00a0a viable indicator of an economy's health, and it must be considered in the context\u00a0of the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/businesscycle.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">business cycle</a> and other economic indicators. For example, in a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/recession.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">recession</a>, countries prefer\u00a0to export more to\u00a0create\u00a0jobs and demand in the economy.

Japan was second and China was third, in terms of the largest trade surplus. Conversely, the United States had the largest trade deficit, even with the ongoing trade war with China, with the United Kingdom and Brazil coming in second and third.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nFor example, the United States imported $239\u00a0billion in goods and services in August 2020 but exported only $171.9 billion\u00a0in goods and services to other countries. So, in August, the United States had a\u00a0trade balance of -$67.1\u00a0billion, or a $67.1\u00a0billion <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trade_deficit.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">trade deficit</a>.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nA\u00a0country with a large\u00a0trade deficit\u00a0borrows money\u00a0to pay for its goods and services, while a country with a large\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trade-surplus.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">trade surplus</a>\u00a0lends money to\u00a0deficit\u00a0countries. In some cases, the trade balance may correlate\u00a0to a\u00a0country's political and economic stability because it reflects the amount of foreign\u00a0investment\u00a0in that country.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debit.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Debit</a> items include imports, foreign aid, domestic spending abroad, and domestic investments abroad.

By subtracting the credit items from the debit items, economists arrive at a trade deficit or trade surplus for a given country over the period of a month, a quarter, or a year.\n"]}
