Value pricing is customer-focused pricing, meaning companies base their pricing on how much the customer believes a product is worth.\n", "\nValue-based pricing is different than \"cost-plus\" pricing, which factors the costs of production into the pricing calculation.\u00a0Companies that offer unique or highly valuable features or services are better positioned to take advantage of the\u00a0value pricing\u00a0model than companies which chiefly sell commoditized items.\n", "\nThe value-based pricing principle mainly applies to markets where possessing an item enhances a customer's self-image or facilitates unparalleled life experiences.\u00a0To that end, this <a class=\"CMY_Link CMY_Valid\" data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/perceived-value.asp\">perceived value</a>\u00a0reflects the worth of an item that consumers are willing to assign to it, and consequently directly affects the price the consumer ultimately pays.\n", "\nAlthough pricing\u00a0value\u00a0is an inexact science, the price can be determined with marketing\u00a0techniques.\u00a0For example, luxury automakers solicit customer feedback, that effectively quantifies customers' perceived value of their experiences driving a particular car model. As a result, sellers can use the value-based pricing approach to establish a vehicle's price, going forward.\n", "\nAny company engaged in value pricing must have a product or service that differentiates itself from the competition. The product must be customer-focused, meaning any improvements and added features should be based on the customer's wants and needs. Of course, the product or service must be of high quality if the company's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/03/022803.asp\">executives</a> are looking to have a value-added pricing strategy.\n", "\nThe company must also have open communication channels and strong relationships with its customers. In doing so, companies can obtain feedback from its customers regarding the features they're looking for as well as how much they're willing to pay.\n", "\nThe fashion industry is one of the most heavily influenced by value-based pricing, where value price determination is standard practice. Typically, popular\u00a0name-brand designers command higher prices based on consumers' perceptions of how the brand affects their image. Also, if a designer can persuade an A-list celebrity to wear his or her look to a red-carpet event, the perceived value of the associated brand can suddenly skyrocket. On the other hand, when a brand's image diminishes for any reason, the pricing strategy tends to re-conform to a cost-based pricing principle.\n", "\nOther industries subject to value-based pricing models include name-brand pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and personal care.\n"]}
