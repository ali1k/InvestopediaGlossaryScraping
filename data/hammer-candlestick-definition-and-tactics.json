This pattern forms a hammer-shaped candlestick, in which the lower shadow is at least twice the size of the real body. The body of the candlestick represents the difference between the open and closing prices, while the shadow shows the high and low prices for the period.\n", "\nA hammer occurs after a security has been declining, suggesting the market is attempting to determine a bottom.\n", "\nHammers signal a potential <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitulation.asp\">capitulation</a> by sellers to form a bottom, accompanied by a price rise\u00a0to indicate a potential <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reversal.asp\">reversal</a> in price direction. This happens all during the one period, where the price falls after the open but then regroups to close near the open.\n", "\nHammers are most effective when they are preceded by at least three or more declining candles. A declining candle is one which closes lower than the close of the candle before it.\n", "\nA hammer should look similar to a \"T\". This indicates the potential for a hammer candle. A hammer candlestick does not indicate a price reversal to the upside until it is confirmed.\n", "\nConfirmation occurs if the candle following the hammer closes above the closing price of the hammer. Ideally, this confirmation candle shows strong buying. Candlestick traders will typically look to enter <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long.asp\">long</a> positions or exit <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp\">short positions</a> during or after the confirmation candle. For those taking new long positions, a stop loss can be placed below the low of the hammer's shadow.\n", "\nHammers aren't usually used in isolation, even with confirmation. Traders typically utilize price or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trendanalysis.asp\">trend analysis</a>, or technical indicators to further confirm <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/06/advcandlesticks.asp\">candlestick patterns</a>.\n", "\nHammers occur on all time frames, including one-minute charts, daily charts, and weekly charts.\n", "\nThe chart shows a price decline followed by a hammer pattern. This pattern had a long lower shadow, several times longer than the real body. The hammer signaled a possible price reversal to the upside.\n", "\nConfirmation came on the next candle, which <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gap.asp\">gapped</a> higher and then saw the price get bid up to a close well above the closing price of the hammer.\n", "\nDuring the confirmation candle is when traders typically step in to buy. A <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stop-lossorder.asp\">stop loss</a> is placed below the low of the hammer, or even potentially just below the hammer's real body if the price is moving aggressively higher during the confirmation candle.\n", "\nA <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/doji.asp\">doji</a> is another type of candlestick with a small real body. A doji signifies indecision because it is has both an upper and lower shadow. Dojis may signal a price reversal or trend continuation, depending on the confirmation that follows This differs from the hammer which occurs after a price decline, signals a potential upside reversal (if followed by confirmation), and only has a long lower shadow.\n", "\nThere is no assurance the price will continue to move to the upside following the confirmation candle. A long-shadowed hammer and a strong confirmation candle may push the price quite high within two periods. This may not be an ideal spot to buy as the stop loss may be a great distance away from the entry point, exposing the trader to risk which doesn't justify the potential reward.\n", "\nHammers also don't provide a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pricetarget.asp\">price target</a>, so figuring what the reward potential for a hammer trade is can be difficult. Exits need to be based on other types of candlesticks patterns or analysis.\n", "\nA hammer candlestick is a technical trading pattern that resembles a \u201cT\u201d whereby the price trend of a security will fall below its opening price, illustrating a long lower shadow, and then consequently reverse and close near its opening. Hammer candlestick patterns occur after a security has fallen in price, typically over three trading days. Often they are meant to signal a reversal pattern\n", "\nThe hammer candlestick is a bullish trading pattern which may indicate that a stock has reached its bottom, and is positioned for trend reversal. Specifically, it indicates that sellers entered the market, pushing the price down, but were later outnumbered by buyers who drove the asset price up. Importantly, the upside price reversal must be confirmed, which means that the next candle must close above the hammer\u2019s previous closing price.\n", "\nWhile a hammer candlestick pattern signals a bullish reversal, a shooting star pattern indicates a bearish price trend. Shooting star patterns occur after a stock uptrend, illustrating an upper shadow. Essentially the opposite of a hammer candlestick, the shooting star rises after opening, but closes roughly at the same level of the trading period. A shooting star pattern signals the top of a price trend.\n"]}
