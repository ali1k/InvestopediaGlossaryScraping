Therefore, investors who are <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bear.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bearish</a> on the long-term prospects of the USD may therefore also be bullish on gold. The term \u201cgold bug\u201d simply refers to the most adamant and outspoken among them.\n", "\nIn some cases, the term gold bug can be used in a pejorative sense, referring to an investor who is unreasonably confident that gold will increase in value. In this context, the term has a similar meaning as the expression \u201cpermabull\u201d, except that it relates specifically to gold. For the most part, however, the term gold bug does not carry a positive or negative connotation. Instead, it simply refers to an investor that has become convinced that gold is likely to rise in value.\n", "\nFor gold bugs, this apparent decline in fiscal health increases the risk that the government will respond to the rising debt burden by effectively <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/devaluation.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">devaluing</a> the USD. For example, if the government were to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/default2.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">default</a> on the national debt\u2014whether deliberately or indirectly, such as by failing to raise the so-called \u201c<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debt-ceiling.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">debt ceiling</a>\u201d\u2014this could cause the value of the USD to decline precipitously on <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/11/why-trade-forex.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">international currency exchange markets</a>, which in turn would cause the price of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"5\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/import.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">imported goods</a> to rise for US consumers.\n", "\nAlternatively, many gold bugs fear that the government will be forced to indirectly devalue the dollar even if they do not formally default on the national debt. For instance, expansionary monetary policy could cause inflation to gradually rise. This would effectively \u201cinflate away\u201d the national debt by eroding the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/032515/what-difference-between-real-and-nominal-interest-rates.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">real value</a> of its outstanding <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/principal.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">principal</a>. On the other hand, this strategy could have severe negative effects on the wealth and purchasing power of investors and citizens whose savings consist largely of USD-denominated assets.\u00a0\n", "\nFor gold bugs, therefore, investing in gold can be an attractive way to both hedge against these risks and profit from any potential USD devaluation.\n", "\nThere are many common arguments for this belief. To begin with, gold bugs often argue that the fiat currency system allows governments to engage in fiscally reckless behaviors such as relying on chronic government borrowing to finance persistent <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/budget-deficit.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">budget deficits</a>. In the United States, for instance, the budget deficit in 2021 is expected to reach $2.3 trillion, which is the second-largest deficit recorded since 1945 (the largest deficit was in 2020).<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff In fact, the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www.thebalance.com/us-deficit-by-year-3306306\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">federal budget has run deficits</a> during all but 11 years since then.
