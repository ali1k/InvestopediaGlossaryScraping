Typically composed of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidasset.asp\">liquid assets</a>, loss reserves\u00a0allow an insurer to cover claims made against insurance policies that it underwrites. Estimating <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liability.asp\">liabilities</a> can be a complex undertaking. Insurers must take into account the duration of the insurance contract, the type of insurance offered,\u00a0the odds of\u00a0a claim being made, and the time of it being\u00a0resolved quickly. Insurers have to adjust their loss reserve calculations as circumstances change.\n", "\nWhen an insurer underwrites a new policy, it records a premium receivable (which is an asset) and a claim obligation (which is a liability). The liability is considered part of the unpaid losses account, which represents the loss reserve.\n", "\nAccounting for loss reserves involves complex calculations\u00a0because losses can come\u00a0at any time, including years down the road. For example, a\u00a0final settlement of litigation with a claimant\u00a0may require\u00a0a multi-year\u00a0court battle, which would drain an insurance company's funds over a long period. Maintaining an adequate level of loss reserves puts an insurance company in a better financial position to pay out claims and any long legal battles.\n", "\nEstimating the correct loss reserve is crucial for a company in maintaining its profitability and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/solvency.asp\">solvency</a>. If an insurance company is too conservative in their loss reserve calculation, they will have allocated too much to the reserve, reducing their income, and the investment ability of assets. On the other hand, if they are too liberal with their calculation, then they will not have allocated enough to their reserves, which would result in booking losses and possible insolvency for the company.\n", "\nInsurers prefer to use <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/presentvalue.asp\">present value</a> when calculating claims since it\u00a0allows them to discount the future value of claim payments and realize how much they have to reserve today. It also takes into consideration the years of interest earned on the reserves before having to pay out a claim. This would technically reduce the liability amount. However, regulators require\u00a0claims to be recorded at the actual value of the loss\u2014its <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nominalvalue.asp\">nominal value</a>. The undiscounted loss reserve will be greater than the discounted loss reserve. This regulatory requirement results in\u00a0higher reported\u00a0liabilities.\n", "\nLoss reserves also impact an insurance company's tax liabilities. Regulators determine an insurer\u2019s taxable income by taking the sum of annual premiums and subtracting any increases in loss reserves. This calculation is called\u00a0a loss reserve deduction. Income, which is the insurer\u2019s <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underwriting-income.asp\">underwriting income</a>, includes the loss reserve deduction plus\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investmentincome.asp\">investment income</a>.\n", "\nThe incorporation of loss reserves into financial statements can often lead to the use of\u00a0loss reserves\u00a0for <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/income-smoothing.asp\">income smoothing</a>. The claims process can be complex so determining whether an insurer is using loss reserves to smooth income requires examining\u00a0changes to the insurer\u2019s loss reserve errors, relative to past investment income.\n", "\nLending institutions also use loss reserves to manage their books, and when applied to the banking industry, are known as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/loanlossprovision.asp\">loan loss provisions</a>, which operate in the same fashion that loss reserves do for an insurance company.\u00a0\n", "\nFor example, consider Bank ABC that\u00a0has made loans in the amount of $10,000,000 to various companies and individuals. Though Bank ABC\u00a0works very hard to qualify the people to whom it grants loans, some\u00a0will\u00a0inevitably\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/default2.asp\">default</a> or\u00a0fall behind, and some loans will have to be renegotiated.\n", "\nBank ABC\u00a0understands these realities\u00a0and, thus,\u00a0estimates that 2%\u00a0of its loans, or $200,000, will probably never be paid back.\u00a0This $200,000 estimate is Bank ABC's\u00a0loan\u00a0loss reserve, and it records this reserve as a negative number on the\u00a0asset\u00a0portion of its\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancesheet.asp\">balance sheet</a>.\n", "\nIf Bank ABC\u00a0decides to write all or a portion of a loan off, it will remove the loan from its asset balance and also remove the amount of the write-off from the loan loss reserve. The amount deducted from the loan loss reserve may be tax-deductible\u00a0for Bank ABC.\n"]}
