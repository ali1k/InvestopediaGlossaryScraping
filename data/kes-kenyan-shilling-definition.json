The shilling is further divided into 100 cents. Prices often include the abbreviation KSh, as in \u201c100 KSh\u201d to refer to 100 shillings. KES is the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreign-exchange.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">foreign exchange</a>\u00a0(FX) trading symbol\n", "\nIn 2009 the KES/USD exchange rate had reached approximately 75 shillings per U.S. dollar, but over the next several years\u00a0weakened to a rate of more than 105 shillings per dollar in 2015 and again in 2017. Since 2016, the Kenyan shilling has hovered around the 100 mark against the dollar as concerns grow around the amount of public debt Kenya has taken on over the years. As of January 2021, USD $1 is equal to roughly 110 KES.\n", "\nThe Kenyan shilling is among the most stable currencies in east Africa. In fact, it often circulates in bordering countries with less stable currencies, such as Sudan and Somalia. Although less volatile than other regional currencies, the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exchangerate.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">exchange rate</a> for the Kenyan shilling has\u00a0generally weakened relative to the U.S. dollar over the past decade.\n", "\nThe Kenyan shilling was first introduced in 1966 to replace the East African shilling. That currency had circulated in British controlled areas of east Africa from the 1920s until the early 1960s when Kenya (and other African countries) gained independence from British rule. Because of recent changes to Kenya\u2019s constitution forbidding the depicting of portraits of individual people, the country began to issue\u00a0new\u00a0banknotes\u00a0and coins\u00a0in 2018.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www.centralbank.go.ke\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">The Central Bank of Kenya</a> manages the nation\u2019s currency and allows its exchange rate to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/floatingexchangerate.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">float freely</a> against others in the global forex market. The central bank operates under a mandate to sustain price stability, maintain liquidity in the country's financial system, and support growth and employment.\n", "\nThe relative valuation of a currency such as the Kenyan shilling to other currencies depends, in no small extent, on the desire for individuals and organizations to hold assets denominated in shillings, which is partly influenced by how other trading partners view Kenya\u2019s potential for economic growth and stability.\n", "\nAccording to the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/kenya/overview\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">World Bank</a>, while Kenya\u2019s economy had been stagnant in recent years, the annual growth rate for the country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) has increased, reaching 5.8 percent in 2016. That yearly growth rate ranks Kenya as one of the fastest-growing economies in Sub-Saharan Africa and only reached 5.4 percent in 2019. Kenya's GDP growth owes a large part to an increase in tourism and investment in the nation\u2019s infrastructure.\u00a0\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/country/kenya\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">World Bank data</a> also shows that gross national income per capita (measured in U.S. dollars) in Kenya doubled between 2006 and 2016 and that the nation\u2019s GDP (also measured in U.S. dollars) more than doubled, increasing from $25.8 billion to $70.5 billion over that same period. The caveat is that Kenya's public debt as a percentage of national output is now 60% compared to around 40% in 2013.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mpesa.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">M-Pesa</a> is a mobile banking service that allows users to store and transfer money through their mobile phones. M-Pesa was introduced in Kenya as an alternative way for the population of the country to have access to financial services. Safaricom, the largest mobile phone operator in Kenya, launched M-Pesa in 2007. The service is a blend of two entities where\u00a0<em>M</em>\u00a0means mobile and\u00a0<em>Pesa</em>\u00a0means money or payment in the Swahili language.\n", "\nCash collected from M-Pesa is deposited in bank accounts held by Safaricom.
