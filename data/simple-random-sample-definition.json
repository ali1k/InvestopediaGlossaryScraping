A simple random sample is meant to be an unbiased representation of a group.\n", "\nAn example of a simple random sample would be the names of 25 employees being chosen out of a hat from a company of 250 employees. In this case, the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/population.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">population</a> is all 250 employees, and the sample is random because each employee has an equal chance of being chosen. Random sampling is used in science to conduct randomized control tests or for blinded experiments.\n", "\nResearchers can create a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042815/what-are-disadvantages-using-simple-random-sample-approximate-larger-population.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">simple random sample</a> using a couple of methods. With a lottery method, each member of the population is assigned a number, after which numbers are selected at random.\n", "\nThe example in which the names of 25 employees out of 250 are chosen out of a hat is an example of the lottery method at work. Each of the 250 employees would be assigned a number between 1 and 250, after which 25 of those numbers would be chosen at random.\n", "\nBecause individuals who make up the subset of the larger group are chosen at random, each individual in the large population set has the same probability of being selected. This creates, in most cases, a balanced subset that carries the greatest potential for representing the larger group as a whole, free from any bias.\n", "\nFor larger populations, a manual lottery method can be quite onerous. Selecting a random sample from a large population usually requires a computer-generated process, by which the same methodology as the lottery method is used, only the number assignments and subsequent selections are performed by computers, not humans.\n", "\nWith a simple random sample, there has to be room for error represented by a plus and minus\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/variance.asp\">variance</a> (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/samplingerror.asp\">sampling error</a>). For example, if in a high school of 1,000 students a survey were to be taken to determine how many students are left-handed, a random sampling can determine that eight out of the 100 sampled are left-handed. The conclusion would be that 8% of the student population of the high school are left-handed, when in fact the global average would be closer to 10%.\n", "\nThe same is true regardless of the subject matter. A survey on the percentage of the student population that has green eyes or\u00a0is physically incapacitated\u00a0would result in a mathematical probability based on a simple random survey, but always with a plus or minus variance. The only way to have a 100% accuracy rate would be to survey all 1,000 students which, while possible, would be impractical.\n", "\nSimple random samples and stratified random samples are <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042415/what-difference-between-simple-random-sample-and-stratified-random-sample.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">both statistical measurement tools</a>. A simple random sample is used to represent the entire data population. A stratified random sample divides the population into smaller groups, or strata, based on shared characteristics.\n", "\nUnlike simple random samples, stratified random samples are used with populations that can be easily broken into different subgroups or subsets. These groups are based on certain criteria, then elements from each are randomly chosen in proportion to the group's size versus the population.\n", "\nThis method of sampling means there will be selections from each different group\u2014the size of which is based on its proportion to the entire population. But the researchers must ensure\u00a0the strata do not overlap. Each point in the population must only belong to one stratum so each point is\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutuallyexclusive.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mutually exclusive</a>. Overlapping strata would increase the likelihood that some data are included, thus skewing the sample.\n", "\nEase of use represents the biggest advantage of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042815/what-are-disadvantages-using-simple-random-sample-approximate-larger-population.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">simple random sampling</a>. Unlike more complicated sampling methods, such as stratified random sampling and probability sampling, no need exists to divide the population into sub-populations or take any other additional steps before selecting members of the population at random.\n", "\nA simple random sample is meant to be an unbiased representation of a group. It is considered a fair way to select a sample from a larger population since every member of the population has an equal chance of getting selected.\n", "\nA <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/samplingerror.asp\">sampling error</a> can occur with a simple random sample if the sample does not end up accurately reflecting the population it is supposed to represent. For example, in our simple random sample of 25 employees, it would be possible to draw 25 men even if the population consisted of 125 women and 125 men.\n", "\nFor this reason, simple random sampling is more commonly used when the researcher knows little about the population. If the researcher knew more, it would be better to use a different sampling technique, such as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/stratified_random_sampling.asp\">stratified random sampling</a>, which helps to account for the differences within the population, such as age, race, or gender. Other disadvantages include the fact that for sampling from large populations, the process can be time-consuming and costly compared to other methods.\n", "\nNo easier method exists to extract a research sample from a larger population than simple random sampling.\u00a0Selecting enough subjects completely at random from the larger population also yields a sample that can be representative of the group being studied.\n", "\nAmong the disadvantages of this technique are difficulty gaining access to respondents that can be drawn from the larger population, greater time, greater costs, and the fact that bias can still occur under certain circumstances.\n", "\nA stratified random sample, in contrast to a simple draw, first divides the population into smaller groups, or strata, based on shared characteristics. Therefore, a stratified sampling strategy will ensure that members from each subgroup are included in the data analysis. Stratified sampling is used to highlight differences between groups in a population, as opposed to simple random sampling, which treats all members of a population as equal, with an equal likelihood of being sampled.\n", "\nUsing simple random sampling allows researchers to make generalizations about a specific population and leave out any bias. Using statistical techniques, inferences and predictions can be made about the population without having to survey or collect data from every individual in that population.\n"]}
