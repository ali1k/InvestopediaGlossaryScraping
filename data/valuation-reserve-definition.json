They function as a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedge.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hedge</a> to an investment portfolio and ensure that an insurance company remains solvent.\n", "\nBecause policies such as life insurance, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/healthinsurance.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">health insurance</a>, and various <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/annuity.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">annuities</a> may be in effect for extended periods of time, valuation reserves protect the insurance company from losses from investments that may not perform as expected. This helps ensure that the policyholders are paid for claims and that annuity holders receive income even if an insurance company\u2019s assets lose value.\n", "\nInsurance companies receive <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurance-premium.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">premiums</a> for the services they provide. In return, when a client files an insurance <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurance_claim.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">claim</a> that needs to be paid out, an insurance company must ensure that it has money on hand to honor this request.\n", "\nThe same applies to any annuities that an insurance company issues. It must ensure that it can meet the regular payments of an annuity.

Valuation reserves help insurance companies do this.\n", "\nValuation reserves make sure that an insurance company holds enough assets to cover any risks that arise from the contracts it has <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underwriting.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">underwritten</a>.

Before 1992, a mandatory securities valuation reserve was required by the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nainsurancec.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">National Association of Insurance Commissioners</a> to protect against a decline in the value of the securities an insurance company holds.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nAfter 1992, however, the mandatory securities valuation reserve requirements were changed to include\u00a0an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset-valuation-reserve-avr.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">asset valuation reserve</a> and an interest maintenance reserve. This reflected the nature of the insurance business, with companies holding different categories of assets and customers purchasing more annuity-related products.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nLife insurance companies have the obligation to pay beneficiaries that purchase insurance and annuities. These companies need to hold an appropriate level of assets in reserve to make sure they can meet these obligations over the many years that the policies may be in effect.\n", "\nVarious state laws and standards require that this level be calculated on an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/actuarialanalysis.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">actuarial</a> basis.

Then, by 1990, reserves for life insurance fell to 29% of all reserves while the percentage held for individual annuities climbed up to 23%.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff This reflected the growth in the popularity of retirement plans that were administered by insurance companies.\n", "\nA changing <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">interest rate</a> climate can create risk that impacts reserves needed for ongoing annuity payments more than for life insurance benefits that are paid in one lump sum. By recommending changing regulations to separate asset valuation reserves from interest maintenance reserves, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners recognized the need to protect against fluctuations in the value of equity and credit-related <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalgain.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">capital gains</a> and losses differently than interest-related gains and losses.\n"]}
