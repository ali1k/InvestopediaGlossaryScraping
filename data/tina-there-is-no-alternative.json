Today, it is often used by investors to explain a less-than-ideal <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetallocation.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">portfolio allocation</a>, usually of\u00a0stocks, because\u00a0other <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetclasses.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">asset classes</a> offer even worse returns. This situation and the subsequent decisions of investors can lead to the \"TINA Effect\" whereby\u00a0stocks rise only because investors have no viable alternative.\n", "\nHerbert Spencer, who lived from 1820 to 1903, was a British intellectual who strongly defended classical liberalism. He believed in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/laissezfaire.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">laissez-faire</a> government and positivism \u2013 the ability of technological and social progress to solve society's problems \u2013 and considered that\u00a0Darwin's theory of \"survival of the fittest\" should apply to human interactions. To critics of capitalism, free markets, and democracy, he frequently responded, \"There is no alternative.\"\n", "\nTINA can evoke either positive or negative connotations. On the positive side, believing that there is no alternative to some course of action rallies support around the chosen path. On the other hand, such a belief may cause one to lose hope.\n", "\nMargaret Thatcher, a Conservative, served as Britain's prime minister from 1979 to 1990. She used the phrase in a similar way to Spencer when\u00a0responding to critics of her market-oriented policies of deregulation, political centralization, spending cuts, and a rollback of the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/welfare-state.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">welfare state</a>. Alternatives to this approach abounded, from the policies advocated by Labour to those in place in the Soviet Union. To Thatcher, however,\u00a0free-market <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/neoliberalism.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">neoliberalism</a> had no alternative.\n", "\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, American political scientist Francis Fukuyama argued that this view had been permanently vindicated. With <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/communism.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">communism</a> discredited, he wrote that no ideology could ever seriously compete with capitalism and democracy again: the \"end of history\" that <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/karl-marx.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Marx</a>\u00a0promised had arrived, albeit in a different form.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nA different usage of the TINA effect\u00a0has been seen among investors in recent years, and the phrase now refers\u00a0to a lack of satisfactory alternatives to an investment that is seen as\u00a0questionable. For example, late in a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bullmarket.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bull market</a>, investors might be concerned with the possibility of\u00a0a reversal and be unwilling to allocate much of their portfolios to stocks.\n", "\nOn the other hand, if bonds offer low yields.\u00a0and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">illiquid</a> assets such as\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/privateequity.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">private equity</a> or real estate are also unattractive, investors\u00a0may hold stocks despite their concerns rather than revert\u00a0to cash. If enough participants are of the same mind, the market can experience a \"TINA effect,\" rising gradually despite an apparent lack of drivers\u00a0since there are no other options for capital\u00a0increase.\n"]}
