The overdraft allows the account holder to continue withdrawing money even when the account has no funds in it or has insufficient funds to cover the amount of the withdrawal.\n", "\nBasically, an overdraft means that the bank allows customers to borrow a set amount of money. There is interest on the loan, and there is typically a fee per overdraft. At many banks, an overdraft fee can run upwards of $35.\n", "\nWith an overdraft account, a bank is covering payments a customer has made that would otherwise be rejected, or in the case of actual checks, would <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bouncedcheck.asp\">bounce</a> and be returned without payment.\n", "\nAs with any loan, the borrower <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/071114/whats-better-way-borrow-money-overdraft-or-credit-cards.asp\">pays interest</a> on the outstanding balance of an overdraft loan. Often, the interest on the loan is lower than the interest on credit cards, making the overdraft a better short-term option in an emergency. In many cases, there are additional fees for using overdraft protection that reduce the amount available to cover your checks, such as insufficient funds fees per check or withdrawal.\n", "\nOverdraft protection provides the customer with a valuable tool to manage their checking account. If you're short a few dollars on your rent payment, overdraft protection ensures that you won't have a check returned against insufficient funds, which would reflect poorly on your ability to pay. However, banks provide the service because of how they benefit from it\u2014namely, by charging a fee. As such, customers should be sure to use the overdraft protection sparingly and only in an emergency.\n", "\nThe dollar amount of overdraft protection varies by account and by the bank. There are <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/071114/what-are-pros-and-cons-overdraft-protection.asp\">pros and cons to using</a> overdraft protection. Often, the customer needs to request the addition of overdraft protection. If the overdraft protection is used excessively, the financial institution can remove the protection from the account.\n", "\nYour bank can opt to use its own funds to cover your overdraft. Another option is to link the overdraft to a credit card. If the bank uses its own funds to cover your overdraft, it typically won't affect your credit score. When a credit card is used for the overdraft protection, it's possible that you can increase your debt to the point where it could affect your credit score. However, this won't show up as a problem with overdrafts on your checking accounts.\n", "\nIf you don't pay your overdrafts back in a predetermined amount of time, your bank can turn over your account to a collection agency. This collection action can affect your credit score and get reported to the three main credit agencies: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. It depends on how the account is reported to the agencies as to whether it shows up as a problem with an overdraft on a checking account.\n", "\nOverdraft is a loan provided by a bank that allows a customer to pay for bills and other expenses when the account reaches zero. For a fee, the bank provides a loan to the client in the event of an unexpected charge or insufficient account balance. Typically these accounts will charge a one-time funds fee and interest on the outstanding balance\u00a0.\n", "\nUnder overdraft protection, if a client\u2019s checking account enters a negative balance, they will be able to access a predetermined loan provided by the bank, and are charged a fee. In many cases overdraft protection is used to prevent a check from bouncing, and the embarrassment that this may cause. Additionally, it may prevent a non-sufficient fund fee, but in many cases each will type of fee will charge roughly the same amount.\n", "\nWhile the pros of overdraft involve providing temporary emergency funds when an account unexpectedly has insufficient funds, it's important to weigh the costs. Overdraft protection often comes with a significant fee and interest, that if not paid off in a timely manner, can add an additional burden to the account holder. According to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, customers who had overprotection, in fact, paid more in fees than those without overdraft protection.\u00a0\n"]}
