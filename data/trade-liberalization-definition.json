These barriers include <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tariff.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tariffs</a>, such as duties and surcharges, and nontariff barriers, such as licensing rules and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quota.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">quotas</a>. Economists often view\u00a0the easing or eradication of these restrictions as steps to promote free trade.\n", "\nTrade liberalization is a controversial topic. Critics of trade liberalization claim that the policy can cost jobs because cheaper goods will flood the nation's domestic market. Critics also suggest that the goods can be of inferior quality and less safe than competing domestic products that may have undergone more rigorous safety and quality checks.\n", "\nProponents of trade liberalization, however, claim that it\u00a0ultimately lowers consumer costs, increases efficiency, and fosters <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economicgrowth.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">economic growth</a>.\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/protectionism.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Protectionism</a>, the opposite of trade liberalization, is characterized by\u00a0strict barriers and market regulation. The outcome of trade liberalization and the resulting integration among countries is known as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/globalization.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">globalization</a>.\n", "\nTrade liberalization promotes <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/free-trade.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">free trade</a>, which allows countries to trade goods\u00a0without regulatory barriers or their associated costs. This reduced regulation decreases costs for countries that trade with other nations and\u00a0may, ultimately,\u00a0result in lower consumer prices because imports are subject to\u00a0lower fees and competition is likely to increase.\u00a0\n", "\nIncreased competition from abroad as a result of trade liberalization creates an incentive for greater efficiency and cheaper production by domestic firms. This competition might also spur a country to shift resources to\u00a0industries in which it may have a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/competitive_advantage.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">competitive advantage</a>.\u00a0For example, trade liberalization has encouraged\u00a0the United Kingdom to concentrate on its service sector rather than manufacturing.\n", "\nHowever, trade liberalization can negatively affect certain businesses within a nation because of greater competition from foreign producers and may result in less\u00a0local support for those industries. There may also be a financial and social risk if products or raw materials come from countries with lower environmental standards.\n", "\nTrade liberalization can\u00a0pose a threat to developing nations or economies because they are forced to compete in the same market as stronger economies or nations. This challenge can stifle established local industries or result in the failure of newly developed industries there.\n", "\nCountries with advanced education systems tend to adapt\u00a0rapidly to a free-trade economy because they have a labor market that can\u00a0adjust to changing demands and production facilities that can\u00a0shift their focus to more in-demand goods. Countries with lower educational standards may struggle to\u00a0adapt\u00a0to a\u00a0changing economic environment.\n", "\nThe <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nafta.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">North American Free Trade Agreement</a> (NAFTA) was signed on Dec. 17, 1992, by Canada, Mexico, and the United States. It entered into force on Jan. 1, 1994.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff The agreement eliminated the tariffs on products that were traded among the three countries. One of NAFTA's goals was to integrate Mexico with the highly developed economies of the United States and Canada, in part because Mexico was considered a lucrative new market for Canada and the United States. The three governments also hoped that the trade deal would improve Mexico's economy.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nOver time, regional trade tripled, and cross-border investment increased among the countries. However, Former President Donald J. Trump considered the agreement detrimental to U.S. jobs and manufacturing. On Sept. 30, 2018, the Trump administration concluded negotiations on an updated pact, the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/usmca-4582387\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement</a> (USMCA), which entered into force on July 1, 2020.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\u00a0\n", "\nMost economists agree that NAFTA was beneficial to the Canadian and U.S. economies. According to a Council on Foreign Relations report, regional trade increased from <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/naftas-economic-impact\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">$290 billion in 1993 to over $1.1 trillion in 2016</a>, and U.S. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fdi.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">foreign direct investment</a> (FDI) stock in Mexico increased from $15 billion to more than $100 billion. However, economists also say that other factors may also have contributed to these outcomes, such as technological change and extended trade with China.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nCritics of NAFTA argue that the agreement caused job losses and wage stagnation in the United States because companies moved their production to Mexico to take advantage of lower labor costs.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff It remains to be seen how the USMCA will affect these factors.\n"]}
