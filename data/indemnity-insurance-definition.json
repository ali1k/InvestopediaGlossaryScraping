Insurance companies provide coverage in exchange for <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/premium.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">premiums</a> paid by the insured parties. These policies are commonly designed to protect professionals and business owners when they are found to be at fault for a specific event such as misjudgment or malpractice.

A client who suffers a loss can file a civil claim. In response, the professional\u2019s indemnity insurance will pay\u00a0litigation costs as well as any damages awarded by the court.\n", "\nAs with any other form of insurance, indemnity insurance covers the costs of an indemnity claim including but not limited to court costs, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fee.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fees</a>,\u00a0and settlements. The amount covered by insurance depends on the specific agreement, and the cost of the insurance depends on many factors including the history of indemnity claims. Typical examples of indemnity insurance include professional insurance policies like <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/malpractice-insurance.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">malpractice insurance</a> and errors and omissions insurance (E&amp;O). These special insurance policies indemnify or reimburse\u00a0professionals against claims made as they conduct their business.\n", "\nCertain professionals must carry indemnity insurance. These professionals include those involved in financial and legal services, such as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-advisor.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">financial advisors</a>, insurance agents, accountants, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortgagebroker.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mortgage brokers</a>, and attorneys.

Malpractice insurance protects medical practitioners from civil claims arising from negligence which results in physical or mental harm to patients. A growing number of executives purchase indemnity insurance to protect their deferred compensation plans against company claims or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bankruptcy.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bankruptcy</a>. Other professions, such as contractors, consultants, and maintenance professionals, carry indemnity insurance as a practical matter due to their exposure to failure to perform claims.\n", "\nProfessional indemnity insurance provides a critical layer of protection for service providers. Often these professionals might also need other forms of liability coverage such as general liability insurance or product liability coverage.

Let's say Mr. Brown takes out a life $250,000 life insurance policy and names his wife as the beneficiary. He pays monthly premiums on the policy to the insurance company. A decade later, Mr. Brown dies in a car accident. After processing the paperwork, the insurance company issues Mr. Brown's wife a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/payout.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">payout</a> for the policy amount\u2014$250,000.
