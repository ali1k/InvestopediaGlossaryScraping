A life income fund cannot be withdrawn in a lump sum. Owners must use the fund in a manner that supports retirement income for their lifetime. Each year's\u00a0Income Tax\u00a0Act specifies the minimum and maximum withdrawal amounts for RRIFs, which encompasses LIFs. The Income Tax Act\u2019s RRIF stipulations take into consideration fund balances and an annuity factor.\n", "\nLife income funds are offered by Canadian financial institutions. They provide individuals with an investment vehicle for managing the payouts from <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/locked-in-retirement-account.asp\">locked-in</a> pension funds and other assets. In many cases, pension assets may be held but not accessible if an employee leaves a firm. These assets, usually called locked-in assets, can be managed in other investment vehicles but may require conversion to a life income fund when the owner is ready to begin taking withdrawals.\n", "\nLife income fund payouts are determined by a government formula which applies to all types of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rrif.asp\">RRIFs</a>. Most provinces in Canada require that life income fund assets be invested in a life annuity. In many provinces, LIF withdrawals can begin at any age as long as the income is used for retirement income. Once an investor begins taking LIF payouts they must monitor the minimum and maximum amounts that can be withdrawn. These amounts are disclosed in the annual Income Tax Act, which provides stipulations pertaining to all RRIFs. The maximum RRIF/LIF withdrawal is the larger of two formulas, both defined as a percentage of the total investments.\n", "\nThe\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financialinstitution.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">financial institution</a>\u00a0from which the LIF is issued must provide an annual statement to the LIF owner. Based on the annual statement, the LIF owner must specify at the beginning of each\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiscalyear.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fiscal year</a>\u00a0the amount of income they would like to withdraw. This must be within a defined range to ensure the\u00a0account holds\u00a0enough funds to provide lifetime income for the LIF owner.\n", "\nLife income funds are offered by many institutions in Canada to support retirement distributions for investors.
