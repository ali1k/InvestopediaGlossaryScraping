The idea is that people, businesses, and corporations with <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vertical_equity.asp\">higher incomes</a> can and should pay more in taxes.\u00a0\n", "\nAbility-to-pay taxation argues that those who earn higher incomes should pay a greater percentage of those incomes in taxes compared with those who earn less. For example, in 2020 individuals in the United States with taxable <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/income.asp\">income</a> less than $9,875 faced a 10% income tax rate, while those with taxable income of more than $518,000 faced a rate of 37%, the nation's top individual rate.\u00a0Earnings between those amounts face tax rates as set by income brackets.\n", "\nThe idea underlying ability-to-pay taxation is that everyone should make an equal sacrifice in paying taxes, and because people with more money effectively have less use for a given dollar, paying more of them in taxes does not impose a greater burden. Think of it this way: To a person with earns $1 million a year, $10,000 will make very little difference in their life, while it will make a big difference to a person earning only $60,000 a year.\n", "\nThe idea of a progressive income tax\u2014that is, that people with the ability to pay more should pay a higher percentage of their income\u2014is centuries old. In fact, it was espoused by none other than <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/updates/adam-smith-economics/\">Adam Smith</a>, considered the father of economics, in 1776.\n", "\nSmith wrote: \u201cThe subjects of every state ought to contribute toward the support of the government, as near as possible, in proportion to their respective abilities; that is in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state.\u201d\n", "\nAdvocates of ability-to-pay taxation argue that those who have benefitted most from the nation\u2019s way of life in the form of higher incomes and greater wealth can afford and should be obligated to give back a little more to keep the system running.\n", "\nThe argument is that the society that government tax revenue has helped build\u2014<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/infrastructure.asp\">infrastructure</a> such as highways and fiberoptic communications networks, a strong military, public schools, a free market system\u2014provide the environment in which their success is possible and in which they can continue to enjoy that success.\n", "\nCritics of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/progressivetax.asp\">progressive taxation</a> argue that it is <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www.hoover.org/research/inequity-progressive-income-tax\" rel=\"nofollow\">fundamentally unfair</a>. They say it penalizes hard work and success and reduces the incentive to make more money. Many argue that everyone should pay the same income-tax rate\u2014a \"flat tax\"\u2014to make the system more equitable.\n", "\nWhile the U.S. still maintains a progressive tax system, tax rates for the rich have plummeted over the past several decades. When President Ronald Reagan took office in 1981, the highest income <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economic-recovery-tax-act.asp\">tax bracket for individuals was 70%</a>. In 2020, the top rate for incomes is 37%. Meanwhile, inequality has reached levels not seen in at least a century. The top 1% now holds more wealth than the bottom 90%.\n"]}
