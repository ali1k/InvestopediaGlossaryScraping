Most companies that sell directly to consumers can be referred to as B2C companies.\n", "\nB2C became immensely popular during the dotcom boom of the late 1990s when it was mainly used to refer to online retailers who sold products and services to consumers through the Internet.\n", "\nAs a business model, business-to-consumer differs significantly from the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/btob.asp\">business-to-business</a> model, which refers to commerce between two or more businesses.\n", "\nBusiness-to-consumer (B2C) is among the most popular and widely known of sales models. The idea of B2C was first utilized by Michael Aldrich in 1979, who used television as the primary medium to reach out to consumers.\n", "\nB2C traditionally referred to mall shopping, eating out at restaurants, pay-per-view movies, and infomercials. However, the rise of the Internet created a whole new B2C business channel in the form of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ecommerce.asp\">e-commerce</a>, or selling goods and services over the Internet.\n", "\nAlthough many B2C companies fell victim to the subsequent dot-com bust as investor interest in the sector dwindled and venture capital funding dried up, B2C leaders such as Amazon\u00a0and Priceline\u00a0survived the shakeout and have since seen great success.\n", "\nAny business that relies on B2C sales must maintain good relations with their <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/customer.asp\">customers</a> to ensure they return. Unlike business-to-business (B2B), whose marketing campaigns are geared to demonstrate the value of a product or service, companies that rely on B2C must elicit an emotional response to their marketing in their customers.\n", "\nTraditionally, many manufacturers sold their products to retailers with physical locations. Retailers made profits on the markup they added to the price paid to the manufacturer. But that changed once the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/030415/worlds-top-10-internet-companies.asp\">Internet</a> came. New businesses arose that promised to sell directly to the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/end-user.asp\">consumer</a>, thus cutting out the middleperson\u2014the retailer\u2014and lowering prices. During the bust of the dotcom boom in the 1990s, businesses fought to secure a web presence. Many retailers were forced to shutter their doors and went out of business.\n", "\nDecades after the dotcom revolution, B2C companies with a web presence are continuing to dominate over their traditional brick-and-mortar competitors. Companies such as Amazon, Priceline, and eBay are survivors of the early dot com boom. They have gone on to expand upon their early success to become industry disruptors.\n", "\nThere are typically five types of online B2C business models that most companies use online to target consumers.\n", "\n<strong>1. Direct sellers. </strong>This is the most common model, in which people buy goods from online retailers. These may include <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/manufacturing.asp\">manufacturers</a> or small businesses, or simply online versions of department stores that sell products from different manufacturers.\u00a0\n", "\n<strong>2. Online intermediaries. </strong>These are liaisons or go-betweens who don\u2019t actually own products or services that put buyers and sellers together. Sites like Expedia, Trivago, and Etsy fall into this category.\n", "\n<strong>3. Advertising-based B2C. </strong>This model uses free content to get visitors to a website. Those visitors, in turn, come across digital or online ads. Basically, large volumes of web traffic are used to sell advertising, which sells goods and services. Media sites like the Huffington Post, a high-traffic site that mixes in advertising with its native content is one example.\u00a0\n", "\n<strong>4. Community-based. </strong>Sites like Facebook, which builds online communities based on shared interests, help marketers and advertisers promote their products directly to consumers. Websites will target ads based on users\u2019 demographics and geographical location.\n", "\n<strong>5. Fee-based. </strong>Direct-to-consumer sites like Netflix charge a fee so consumers can access their content. The site may also offer free, but limited, content while charging for most of it. The New York Times and other large newspapers often use a fee-based B2C business model.\u00a0\n", "\nDecades after the e-commerce boom, B2C companies are continuing to eye a growing market: mobile purchasing. With <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smartphone.asp\">smartphone</a> apps and traffic growing year-over-year, B2C companies have been shifting attention to mobile users and capitalizing on this popular technology.\n", "\nThroughout the early 2010s, B2C companies were rushing to develop mobile apps, just as they were with websites decades earlier. In short, success in a B2C model is predicated on continuously evolving with the appetites, opinions, trends, and the desires of consumers.\n", "\nAs mentioned above, the business-to-consumer model differs from the business-to-business (B2B) model. While consumers buy products for their personal use, businesses buy products to use for their companies. Large purchases, such as capital equipment, generally requires approval from those who head up a company. This makes a business' purchasing power much more complex than that of the average consumer.\n", "\nUnlike the B2C business model, pricing structures tend to be different in the B2B model. With B2C, consumers often pay the same price for the same products. However, prices are not necessarily the same. In fact, businesses tend to negotiate prices and payment terms.\n", "\nAfter surging in popularity in the 1990s, business to consumer (B2C) increasingly became a term that referred to companies with consumers as their end users. This stands in contrast to business to business (B2B), or companies whose primary clients are other businesses. B2C companies operate on the internet and sell products to customers online. Amazon, Facebook, and Walmart are some examples of B2C companies.\n", "\nOne example of a major B2C company today is Shopify, which has developed a platform for small retailers to sell their products and reach a broader audience online.\u00a0Before the advent of the internet, however, business to consumer was a term that was used to describe take out restaurants, or companies in a mall, for instance. In 1979, Michael Aldrich further utilized this term to attract consumers through television.\n", "\nBroadly speaking, B2C models will fall into the following five categories: direct sellers, online intermediaries, advertising-based B2C, community based, and fee based. The most frequently occurring is the direct seller model, where goods are purchased directly from online retailers. By contrast, an online intermediary model would include companies like Expedia, which connect buyers and sellers. Meanwhile, a fee-based model includes services such as Disney+, which charges a subscription to stream their video-on-demand content.\n"]}
