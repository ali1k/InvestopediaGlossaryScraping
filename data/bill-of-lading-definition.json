A bill of lading also serves as a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/receipt.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">shipment receipt</a> when the carrier delivers the goods at a predetermined destination. This document must accompany the shipped products, no matter\u00a0the form of\u00a0transportation, and\u00a0must be signed by an authorized representative from the carrier, shipper and receiver.\ufeff<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff <span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nAs an example, a\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/logistics.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">logistics</a> company intends to transport, via heavy truck, gasoline from a plant in Texas to a gas station in Arizona. A plant\u00a0representative and the driver sign the bill of lading after loading the gas on the truck. Once the carrier delivers the fuel to the gas station in Arizona,\u00a0the truck driver requests that the station clerk also sign the document.\n", "\nThe bill of lading is a legally binding document that provides the carrier and shipper with all of the necessary details to accurately process a shipment. It has three main functions. First, it is a document of title to the goods described in the bill of lading. Secondly, it is a receipt for the shipped products. Finally, the bill of lading represents the agreed terms and conditions for the transportation of the goods.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff <span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nEvery business\u00a0needs to have\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/internalcontrols.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">internal controls</a>\u00a0in place\u00a0to prevent theft. One key component\u00a0of\u00a0internal control\u00a0is segregation of duties, which prevents one employee from having too much control within a\u00a0business.\n", "\nNo two internal controls systems are the same. However, most follow a standard set of core philosophies that have become standard management practice. The implemention of internal controls can help streamline operations and prevent <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fraud.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fraud</a>.\n", "\nA bill of lading is one of several key documents that must be properly managed and reviewed to\u00a0prevent asset theft. Assume, for example,\u00a0XYZ Fine Dining receives shipments of fresh meat and fish five times a week. The restaurant manager\u00a0determines\u00a0the\u00a0type and amount of meat and fish the restaurant needs to order. He then\u00a0fills out a purchase order, and\u00a0XYZ\u2019s owner reviews and initials each <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/purchase-order-lead-time.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PO</a> before it is emailed to the food vendor. The vendor gathers the\u00a0meat and fish, and both he and a representative from the overnight carrier sign a bill of lading.\n", "\nNext, the carrier delivers the food to the restaurant, and the manager compares the information on the bill of lading to what he requested on the PO. If the\u00a0information matches, the\u00a0PO and\u00a0the bill of lading are sent to the\u00a0owner, who\u00a0reviews the documents and writes a check payable to the food vendor.\n", "\nIn this example, the owner does not issue a check to the\u00a0vendor without reviewing the\u00a0purchase order (PO) and\u00a0the bill of lading. This step ensures XYZ only pays for\u00a0what\u00a0it\u00a0ordered and what it\u00a0received. If the two documents do not match when the restaurant manager compares them,\u00a0the manager\u00a0will ask the vendor\u00a0about the exception. A third employee\u00a0reconciles the\u00a0bank statement and\u00a0makes company\u00a0deposits. All of these steps must be in place to\u00a0prevent theft.\n"]}
