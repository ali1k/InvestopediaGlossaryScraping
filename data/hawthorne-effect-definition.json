However, the researchers were perplexed to find that productivity improved, not just when the lighting was improved, but also when the lighting was diminished. Productivity improved whenever changes were made in other variables such as working hours and rest breaks.\n", "\nThe researchers concluded that the workers\u2019 productivity was not being affected by the changes in working conditions, but rather by the fact that someone was concerned enough about their working conditions to conduct an experiment on it.\n", "\nResearch often relies on human subjects. In these cases, the Hawthorne Effect\u00a0is the intrinsic bias\u00a0that\u00a0researchers must take into consideration when studying their findings. Although it can be challenging to determine how a subject's awareness of a study might\u00a0modify\u00a0their behavior, researchers should nevertheless strive to be mindful of this phenomenon and adapt accordingly.\n", "\nWhile there is no universally agreed-upon methodology for achieving this, experience and keen attention to the situation can help researchers prevent this effect from tarnishing their results.\n", "\nAs an example of the Hawthorne Effect, consider a 1978 study conducted to determine if cerebellar neurostimulators could reduce the motor dysfunction of young cerebral palsy sufferers. The objective testing revealed that the patients in the study claimed that their motor dysfunctions decreased and that they embraced the treatment. But this patient feedback countered the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quantitativeanalysis.asp\">quantitative analysis</a>, which demonstrated that there was scant increased motor function.\n", "\nIndeed, the increased human interaction with doctors, nurses, therapists, and other medical personnel during these trials had a positive psychological impact on patients, which consequently fostered their illusion of physical improvements to their conditions. When analyzing the results, researchers concluded that the Hawthorne Effect negatively impacted the data, as there was no evidence that the cerebellar neurostimulators were measurably effective.\n"]}
