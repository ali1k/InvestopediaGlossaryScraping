For example, utilities have many assets and debt on the balance sheet compared to a relatively small amount of net income. A normal ROE in the utility sector could be 10% or less. A technology or retail firm with smaller balance sheet accounts relative to net income may have normal ROE levels of 18% or more.\n", "\nA good rule of thumb is to target an ROE that is equal to or just above the average for the peer group. For example, assume a company, TechCo, has maintained a steady ROE of 18% over the last few years compared to the average of its peers, which was 15%. An investor could conclude that TechCo\u2019s management is above average at using the company\u2019s assets to create profits. Relatively high or low ROE ratios will vary significantly from one industry group or sector to another. When used to evaluate one company to another similar company, the comparison will be more meaningful. A common shortcut for investors is to consider a return on equity near the long-term average of the S&amp;P 500 (14%) as an acceptable ratio and anything less than 10% as poor.\n", "\nSustainable growth rates and dividend growth rates can be estimated using ROE, assuming that the ratio is roughly in line or just above its peer group average. Although there may be some challenges, ROE can be a good starting place for developing future estimates of a stock\u2019s growth rate and the growth rate of its <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">dividends</a>. These two calculations are functions of each other and can be used to make an easier comparison between similar companies.\n", "\nTo estimate a company\u2019s future growth rate, multiply the ROE by the company\u2019s <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/retentionratio.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">retention ratio</a>. The retention ratio is the percentage of net income that is retained or reinvested by the company to fund future growth.\n", "\nAssume that there are two companies with an identical ROE and net income, but different retention ratios. Company A has an ROE of 15% and returns 30% of its net income to shareholders in a dividend, which means company A retains 70% of its net income. Business B also has an ROE of 15% but returns only 10% of its net income to shareholders for a retention ratio of 90%.\n", "\nFor company A, the growth rate is 10.5%, or ROE times the retention ratio, which is 15% times 70%. Business B's growth rate is 13.5%, or 15% times 90%.\n", "\nThis analysis is referred to as the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/sustainable-growth-rate/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sustainable growth rate</a> model. Investors can use this model to make estimates about the future and to identify stocks that may be risky because they are running ahead of their sustainable growth ability. A stock that is growing slower than its sustainable rate could be undervalued, or the market may be discounting risky signs from the company. In either case, a growth rate that is far above or below the sustainable rate warrants additional investigation.\n", "\nThis comparison seems to make business B more attractive than company A, but it ignores the advantages of a higher dividend rate that may be favored by some investors. We can modify the calculation to estimate the stock\u2019s dividend growth rate, which may be more important to income investors.\n", "\nContinuing with our example from above, the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividendgrowthrate.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">dividend growth rate</a> can be estimated by multiplying ROE by the<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/payoutratio.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> payout ratio</a>. The payout ratio is the percentage of net income that is returned to common shareholders through dividends. This formula gives us a sustainable dividend growth rate, which favors company A.\n", "\nThe company A dividend growth rate is 4.5%, or ROE times the payout ratio, which is 15% times 30%. Business B's dividend growth rate is 1.5%, or 15% times 10%. A stock that is growing its dividend far above or below the sustainable dividend growth rate may indicate risks that should be investigated.\n", "\nIt is reasonable to wonder why an average or slightly above-average ROE is good rather than an ROE that is double, triple, or even higher than the average of their peer group. Aren\u2019t stocks with a very high ROE a better value?\n", "\nSometimes an extremely high ROE is a good thing if net income is extremely large compared to equity because a company\u2019s performance is so strong. However, an extremely high ROE is often due to a small equity account compared to net income, which indicates risk.\n", "\nThe first potential issue with a high ROE could be inconsistent profits. Imagine a company, LossCo, that has been unprofitable for several years. Each year\u2019s losses are recorded on the balance sheet in the equity portion as a \u201cretained loss.\u201d The losses are a negative value and reduce shareholder equity. Assume that LossCo has had a windfall in the most recent year and has returned to profitability. The denominator in the ROE calculation is now very small after many years of losses, which makes its ROE misleadingly high.\n", "\nA second issue that could cause a high ROE is excess debt. If a company has been borrowing aggressively, it can increase ROE because equity is equal to assets minus debt. The more debt a company has, the lower equity can fall. A common scenario is when a company borrows large amounts of debt to buy back its own stock. This can inflate<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eps.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> earnings per share</a> (EPS), but it does not affect actual performance or growth rates.\n", "\nFinally, negative net income and negative shareholder equity can create an artificially high ROE. However, if a company has a net loss or negative shareholders\u2019 equity, ROE should not be calculated.\n", "\nIf shareholders\u2019 equity is negative, the most common issue is excessive debt or inconsistent profitability. However, there are exceptions to that rule for companies that are profitable and have been using cash flow to buy back their own shares. For many companies, this is an alternative to paying dividends, and it can eventually reduce equity (buybacks are subtracted from equity) enough to turn the calculation negative.\n", "\nIn all cases, negative or extremely high ROE levels should be considered a warning sign worth investigating. In rare cases, a negative ROE ratio could be due to a cash flow supported share buyback program and excellent management, but this is the less likely outcome. In any case, a company with a negative ROE cannot be evaluated against other stocks with positive ROE ratios.\n", "\nA high ROE might not always be positive. An outsized ROE can be indicative of a number of issues\u2014such as inconsistent profits or excessive debt. Also, a negative ROE due to the company having a net loss or negative shareholders\u2019 equity cannot be used to analyze the company, nor can it be used to compare against companies with a positive ROE.\n", "\nWhile return on equity looks at how much profit a company can generate relative to shareholders\u2019 equity, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnoninvestmentcapital.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">return on invested capital</a> (ROIC) takes that calculation a couple of steps further.\n", "\nThe purpose of ROIC is to figure out the amount of money after dividends a company makes based on all its sources of capital, which includes shareholders equity and debt. ROE looks at how well a company uses shareholder equity while ROIC is meant to determine how well a company uses all its available capital to make money.\n", "\nFor example, imagine a company with an annual income of $1,800,000 and average shareholders' equity of $12,000,000.

what is changing in a company rather than looking at one simple ratio. As always with financial statement ratios, they should be examined against the company's history and its competitors.\n", "\nFor example, when looking at two peer companies, one may have a lower ROE. With the five-step equation, you can see if this is lower because:\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditor.asp\">creditors</a>\u00a0perceive the company as riskier and charge it higher interest, the company is poorly managed and has leverage that is too low, or the company has higher costs that decrease its\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operating_profit.asp\">operating profit</a>\u00a0margin. Identifying sources like these leads to better knowledge of the company and how it should be valued.\n", "\nAs with most other performance metrics, what counts as a \u201cgood\u201d ROE will depend on the company\u2019s industry and competitors. While the long-term average ROE for companies in the S&amp;P 500 has been around 14%, specific industries can be significantly higher or lower than this average. All else being equal, an industry will likely have a lower average ROE if it is highly competitive and requires substantial assets in order to generate revenues. On the other hand, industries with relatively few players and where only limited assets are needed to generate revenues may show a higher average ROE.\n", "\nTo calculate ROE, analysts simply divide the company\u2019s net income by its average <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholdersequity.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">shareholders\u2019 equity</a>. Since shareholders\u2019 equity is equal to assets minus liabilities, ROE is essentially a measure of the return generated on the net assets of the company. The reason average shareholders\u2019 equity is used is that this figure might fluctuate during the accounting period in question.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnonassets.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ROA</a> and ROE are similar, in that they are both trying to gauge how efficiently the company generates its profits. However, whereas ROE compares net income to the <em>net</em> assets of the company, ROA compares net income to the company\u2019s assets alone, without deducting its liabilities. In both cases, companies in industries where significant assets are needed for operations will likely show a lower average return.\n"]}
