Many of the rules and definitions for applying the day-count convention are set forth by the International Swap Dealers Association, which provides documentation for a wide range of financial transactions.\n", "\nFor example, an agreed-upon day-count convention would be used to calculate the amount of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accruedinterest.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">accrued interest</a> or the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/presentvalue.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">present value</a> (PV) when the next coupon payment is less than a full coupon period away.\n", "\nAmong the most common conventions are 30/360, 30/365, actual/360, actual/365, and actual/actual.\n", "\nEach <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bondmarket.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bond market</a> and financial instrument has its own day-count convention, which varies depending on the type of instrument, whether the interest rate is fixed or floating, and the country of issuance. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bonds</a> and notes issued by the U.S. Treasury earn interest calculated on an actual/actual basis.
