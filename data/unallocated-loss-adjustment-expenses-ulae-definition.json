Insurers that use third parties to investigate the veracity of claims or to act as loss adjusters may include this expense in its allocated loss adjustment expenses.\n", "\nULAE expenses are more general and may include overhead and salaries. The most common expenses fall into the categories of operations and field adjusters.\n", "\nBecause unallocated loss adjustment expenses do not apply to a specific claim, there's no\u00a0loss date or report date for them.

Analysts can determine how accurate an insurance company has been at estimating its reserves by examining its <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/loss-reserve.asp\">loss reserve</a> development.\n", "\nSome liability policies contain a clause, called an endorsement, that requires the policyholder to reimburse the insurance company for unallocated or allocated loss adjustment expenses. These expenses may include fees charged by attorneys, investigators, experts, arbitrators, mediators, and other costs incidental to adjusting a claim.\n", "\nIt is important to carefully read the\u00a0endorsement language, which\u00a0may say that a loss adjustment expense\u00a0is not intended to include the policyholder\u2019s attorney fees and\u00a0costs if an\u00a0insurer denies coverage and a\u00a0policyholder successfully sues the insurer.\u00a0\n", "\nIn this situation, the insurance company has done no actual adjusting\u00a0of the claim, and should not be entitled to apply its deductible to the expenses incurred by the policyholder in defending the claim denied by the\u00a0insurance company.\n"]}
