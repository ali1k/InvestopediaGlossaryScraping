This type of news is closely followed by investors, who can access such findings through the press releases issued on companies\u2019 <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investorrelations.asp\">investor relations</a> pages.\n", "\nNew indications are an early sign that a particular drug or procedure may be worth investing in further. For example, a company that has already obtained <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/regulated-market.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">regulatory approval</a> for a particular drug would report new indications if their research suggests that additional applications for that drug might be possible. New indications are therefore viewed as a positive development by most investors, since they could signify additional revenue-generating opportunities for a company\u2019s existing drugs.\n", "\nIn the United States, companies must go through a rigorous and lengthy process in order to bring new drugs to the market. The <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fda.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Food and Drug Administration (FDA)</a> oversees the development and approval of new drugs through their <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/new-drug-application-nda.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">New Drug Application (NDA)</a> process. The process routinely takes years to complete, with some stretching over a decade. Despite this lengthy process, only about 30% of new applicants have their NDAs approved.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nFor these reasons, one of the most efficient ways for pharmaceutical companies to expand into new markets would be to find new or expanded applications for products that have already received FDA approval. In fact, some companies specialize in repurposing already-approved drugs in an effort to reach <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commercialization.asp\">commercialization</a> of new medicines more quickly.\n", "\nNew indications are often used in news releases on medical treatments and pharmaceutical companies when referring to their drugs or the equipment involved. For example, on August 16, 2018, the FDA released a new indication approval for the drug Opdivo (nivolumab), which is used for the treatment of cancers such as advanced melanoma, advanced renal cell carcinoma, and advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nWhen it was first approved in December 2014, this drug had a more narrow intended usage, specializing in patients with advanced melanoma that could not be removed with surgery or that no longer responded to other drugs.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff The new indication therefore represents an opportunity for the drug to be sold into a larger addressable market than previously anticipated.\n"]}
