A bank, rather than an account holder, guarantees the payment. Banker's acceptances (also known as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/billofexchange.asp\">bills of exchange</a>) are used by companies as a relatively safe form of payment for large transactions. BAs can also be short-term debt instruments, similar to U.S. Treasury bills, that trade at a discount to face value in the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/moneymarket.asp\">money markets</a>.\n", "\nFor the company that issues it, a banker's acceptance is a way to pay for a purchase without borrowing to do so. For the company that receives it, the bill is a guaranteed form of payment.\n", "\nA banker's acceptance requires the bank to pay the holder a set amount of money on a set date. They are most commonly issued 90 days before the date of maturity but can mature at any later date from one to 180 days. They are typically issued in multiples of $100,000.\n", "\nBAs are issued at a discount to their face value. Thus, like a bond, they earn a return. They also can be traded like bonds in the secondary money market. There is no penalty for cashing them in early, except for the lost interest that would have been earned had they been held until their maturity dates.\n", "\nBanker\u2019s acceptances have been around since the 12th century. Just like now, BAs were used as a method of facilitating trade. In the 18th and 19th centuries, BAs started to become an actively traded market in London.\u00a0\n", "\nThe U.S. launched the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalreservebank.asp\">Federal Reserve</a> in the early 1900s to help create banker\u2019s acceptances that compete with London\u2019s. The Fed\u2019s goal was to boost U.S. trade and it was given the authority to purchase certain BAs. While the Fed still buys government bonds, it no longer buys BAs.\n", "\nBanker's acceptances, like certified checks, are a relatively safe form of payment for both sides of a transaction. The money owed is guaranteed to be paid on the date specified on the bill.\n", "\nThe use of BAs is most common in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/11/why-trade-forex.asp\">international trade transactions</a>. A buyer with an importing business can issue a banker\u2019s acceptance with a date after a shipment is due to be delivered, and the seller with an exporting business will have the payment instrument in hand before finalizing the shipment.\n", "\nThe person who is paid with a banker's acceptance may hold onto it until its maturity date in order to receive its full value or can sell it immediately at a discount to face value.\n", "\nUnlike a regular check, a banker\u2019s acceptance relies on the creditworthiness of the banking institution rather than the individual or business that issues it. The bank requires that the issuer meet its credit eligibility requirements, typically including a deposit sufficient to cover the banker\u2019s acceptance.\n", "\nBanks and institutional investors trade banker's acceptances on the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/secondarymarket.asp\">secondary market</a> before they reach maturity. The strategy is similar to that used in trading <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/z/zero-couponbond.asp\">zero-coupon bonds</a>. The BA is sold below face value, at a discount determined by the length of time before the maturity date.\n", "\nBanker's acceptances are considered to be relatively safe investments because the bank and the borrower are liable for the amount that is due when the instrument matures.\n", "\nOne of the key advantages of a banker\u2019s acceptances is it\u2019s backed by a financial institution\u2014i.e. protected against default. This gives the seller assurances related to payment. Meanwhile, buyers are afforded the ability to make purchases in a timely manner and not worry about having to make payments in advance.\u00a0\n", "\nNow, the key risk is that the financial institution will have to make good on the promised payment. This is the key risk for the bank. To help hedge against this, the bank may require the buyer to post collateral.\n", "\nFor a banker\u2019s acceptance, the importer will seek to make a purchase from an exporter (generally in another country). The exporter wants assurance of payment, but the importer also wants assurance that the seller can deliver. Banker\u2019s acceptance is a form of payment backed by a bank that eliminates transaction-related risks for the importer and exporter.\u00a0\n", "\nBanker's acceptances are money market instruments and, like most money markets, are relatively safe and liquid, particularly when the paying bank enjoys a strong credit rating.\n", "\nBanker\u2019s acceptances are assumed to be safe investments as they\u2019re backed by the bank, which means they often trade at a discount to face value. The banker\u2019s acceptance rate is the market rate at which these instruments trade. It\u2019s the return an investor would receive if they purchased today and held until the payment date.\u00a0\n", "\nCommercial paper is a promissory note that pays a fixed rate. It\u2019s unsecured and can be for a few days or years. Commercial paper is generally used to cover short-term obligations (such as the cost for a new project) or short-term receivables. BAs are also short-term promissory notes, although they have the unconditional guarantee of a bank and are often used for trade.\n", "\nFrom an investment perspective, banker\u2019s acceptances are relatively safe investments being money market investments and inline with T-bills from a risk-return perspective. For importers and exporters, BAs help boost trade by reducing transaction-related risks.\u00a0\n"]}
