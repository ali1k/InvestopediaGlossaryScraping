For instance, if a business takes a loan from a financial entity like a bank, the borrowed money will raise the company's assets and the loan liability will also rise by an equivalent amount.\n", "\nIf a business buys <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rawmaterials.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">raw material</a> by paying cash, it will lead to an increase in the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inventory.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">inventory</a> (asset) while reducing cash capital (another asset). Because there are two or more accounts affected by every transaction carried out by a company, the accounting system is referred to as double-entry accounting.\n", "\nThe double-entry practice ensures that the accounting equation always remains balanced, meaning that the left side value of the equation will always match with the right side value. In other words, the total amount of all assets will always equal the sum of liabilities and shareholders' equity.\n", "\nThe global adherence to the double-entry accounting system makes the account keeping and tallying processes much easier, standardized, and fool-proof to a good extent. The accounting equation ensures that all entries in the books and records are vetted, and a verifiable relationship exists between each liability (or expense) and its corresponding source; or between each item of income (or asset) and its source.\n", "\nAlthough the balance sheet always balances out, the accounting equation doesn't provide investors information as to how well a company is performing. Instead, investors must interpret the numbers and decide for themselves whether the company has too many or too few liabilities, not enough assets, or perhaps too many assets, or is financing the company properly to ensure long term growth.\n", "\nBelow is a portion of Exxon Mobil Corporation's\u00a0(<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=xom\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">XOM</a>)\u00a0balance sheet\u00a0in millions as of Dec. 31, 2019:\n", "\nThe accounting equation whereby assets = liabilities + shareholders' equity is calculated as follows:\n", "\nThe accounting equation is the proposition that a company\u2019s assets must be equal to the sum of its liabilities and equity. Phrased differently, it means that the equity of a company is equal to its assets minus its liabilities. This concept is part of the theoretical foundation behind double-entry bookkeeping, and forms the basis for how investors and accountants interpret and analyze financial statements.\n", "\nThe accounting equation is important because it captures the relationship between the three components of a balance sheet: assets, liabilities, and equity. All else being equal, a company\u2019s equity will increase when its assets increase, and vice-versa. Likewise, adding liabilities will decrease equity, whereas reducing liabilities\u2014such as by paying off debt\u2014will increase equity. These basic concepts are captured by the accounting equation and are essential to modern accounting methods.\n", "\nTo illustrate, suppose we have a company with $1 million in assets and $500,000 in liabilities. According to the accounting equation, Assets = Liabilities + Equity. By plugging in these figures, we can quickly discern that the company\u2019s Equity would be $500,000. These values would appear on the company\u2019s balance sheet, and could be used by investors, analysts, or company managers to assess the quality of the business and forecast its future prospects.\n"]}
