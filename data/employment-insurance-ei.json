Employment insurance can also be extended to individuals who are unable to work because of illness or who are caring for a young child or a seriously ill family member. In addition to financial assistance, the program assists the unemployed with job search services.\n", "\nThe Employment Insurance Act replaced the Unemployment Insurance Act of 1996. The updated scheme was designed to link <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/062315/unemployment-rates-country.asp\">unemployment</a> benefits with wages\u00a0and to reduce penalties for those who could\u00a0only find temporary work. To qualify for benefits, individuals must work a certain number of hours, and the length of time for which\u00a0benefits are provided\u00a0depends on an individual's geographic region's unemployment rate.\u00a0\n", "\nEmployers contribute 1.4 times the amount of employee premiums. Since 1990, there has been no\u00a0government contribution to this fund. The amount a person receives and how long they can stay on EI varies with their previous salary, how long they were working, and the unemployment rate in their area.\u00a0\n", "\nEI\u00a0maternity benefits\u00a0are offered to biological mothers, including surrogate mothers, who cannot work because they are pregnant or have recently given birth, and parents of a newly adopted child.\n", "\nA maximum of\u00a015 weeks\u00a0of EI maternity benefits is available, and according to the Canadian government website, if a child has been \"born or placed with you\" after March 17, 2019, you may be \"eligible for 5 extra weeks of standard parental care benefits\" or \"8 extra weeks of extended parental benefits\" depending on your circumstances.\n", "\nBenefits can be paid as early as 12 weeks before the expected date of birth and can end as late as 17 weeks after the actual date of birth. The weekly benefit rate is 55% of the claimant\u2019s average weekly insurable earnings up to a maximum amount.\n", "\nEI sickness assistance provides\u00a0benefits to people who are unable to work because of sickness, injury\u00a0or quarantine. Applicants can\u00a0receive up to a maximum of 15 weeks of\u00a0EI\u00a0sickness benefits.\n", "\nEI also offers compassionate care benefits, which are paid to people who have to be away from work temporarily to provide care or support to a family member or who is gravely ill themselves with a\u00a0significant risk of death. A maximum of 26 weeks of compassionate care benefits may be paid to eligible people.\n", "\nOver half of EI benefits are paid in Ontario and the Western provinces. However,\u00a0EI is especially important in the Atlantic provinces, where there are more unemployed persons. Part of the reason why is that many Atlantic province\u00a0workers are\u00a0employed in seasonal work such as fishing, forestry, or tourism. They\u00a0go on EI over the winter, when there is no work. There are special rules for fishermen making it easier for them to collect employment insurance.\n"]}
