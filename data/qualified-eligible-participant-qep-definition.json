These requirements are defined by Rule 4.7 of the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cea.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Commodity\u00a0Exchange Act</a> (CEA).\n", "\nQualified eligible participants (QEPs) must meet a set of conditions described by the Commodity Exchange Act. They must own at least $2 million in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">securities</a> and other investments, as well as at least $200,000 in initial margin and option premiums for commodity interest transactions. Also, they must have had an open account with a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fcm.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">futures commission merchant</a> (FCM) at any time during the preceding six months. Finally, they must have a combined portfolio of the investments specified in the above requirements.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nQEPs are considered to be more knowledgeable than the typical investor regarding\u00a0sophisticated investments. Hedge funds, for example, are understood to be riskier than <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutualfund.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mutual funds</a>, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pensionplan.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pension funds</a>, and other investment vehicles. They are\u00a0liable to see\u00a0significant losses but produce\u00a0higher-than-average long-term returns when successful. Hedge fund managers go long on assets they predict will do well in the future, while shorting assets they anticipate will fall in price.\u00a0\n", "\nBy law, a plurality of hedge fund participants must be QEPs.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff Hedge funds that limit their\u00a0investors only to QEPs\u00a0may obtain an exemption from several <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) regulations. This exemption allows hedge fund managers more considerable latitude in their investment decisions, which opens the door for both more significant risks and rewards than other types of investments.\n", "\nHedge funds are blamed by many for contributing to the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/09/financial-crisis-review.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2007-2008 Financial Crisis</a> by adding risky, leverage-based derivatives to the banking system. These investments created high returns when the market was good, but amplified the impact of the market's decline.\n", "\nQualified eligible participants\u00a0are similar to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accreditedinvestor.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">accredited investors</a> in that they both must meet specific income and net worth requirements.
