The person or entity writing the check is known as the payor or drawer, while the person to whom the check is written is the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/payee.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">payee</a>. The <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/drawee.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">drawee</a>, on the other hand, is the bank on which the check is drawn.\n", "\nChecks may be cashed or deposited. When the payee presents a check to a bank or other <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financialinstitution.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">financial institution</a> to negotiate, the funds are drawn from the payor\u2019s bank account. It is another way to instruct the bank to transfer funds from the payor\u2019s account to the payee or the payee\u2019s account. Checks are generally <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/personal-finance/complete-guide-checking-accounts/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">written against a checking account</a>, but they can also be used to negotiate funds from a savings or other type of account.\n", "\nIn some parts of the world, such as Canada and England, the spelling used is \u201ccheque.\u201d\n", "\nA check is a bill of exchange or document that guarantees a certain amount of money. It is printed for the drawing bank to give to an account holder\u2014the payor\u2014to use. The payor writes the check and presents it to the payee, who then takes it to their bank or other financial institution to negotiate for cash or to deposit into an account.\n", "\nThe use of checks allows two or more parties to make a monetary transaction without the need of actually exchanging physical <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currency.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">currency</a>.\u00a0Instead, the amount for which the check is written is a substitute for physical currency of the same amount.\n", "\nChecks can be used to make bill payments, as gifts, or to transfer sums between two people or entities. They are generally seen as a more secure way of transferring money than cash, especially when there are large sums involved. If a check is lost or stolen, a third party is not able to cash it, as the payee is the only one who can negotiate the check. Modern substitutes for checks include debit and credit cards, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wiretransfer.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">wire transfers</a>, and internet banking.\n", "\nChecks have been in existence in one form or another since ancient times. Many people believe a type of check was used among the ancient Romans.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff While each culture that adopted a form of check had its own system, they all shared the basic idea of substituting the check for physical currency.\n", "\nIn 1717 the Bank of England was the first organization to issue preprinted checks.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff The oldest American check dates to the 1790s.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nModern checks, as we know them today, became popular in the 20th century. Check usage surged in the 1950s as the check process became automated and machines were able to sort and clear checks. Check cards, first created in the 1960s, were the precursors to today\u2019s debit cards.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff Credit and debit cards\u2014and other forms of electronic payment\u2014have since overshadowed checks as the dominant means of paying for most goods and services. Checks are now somewhat uncommon but still used among the general population.\n", "\nWhile not all checks look alike, they generally share the same key parts. The name and contact information of the person writing the check is located at the top left-hand side.\u00a0The name of the bank that holds the drawer\u2019s account appears on the check as well.\n", "\nThere are a number of lines that need to be filled in by the payor:\n", "\nThere is also a memo line on the bottom left hand corner of the check underneath the drawing bank\u2019s information. The payor may use it to fill in any pertinent information, such as a reference number, an account number, or any other reason for writing the check.\n", "\nA series of coded numbers are found along the bottom edge of the check, directly underneath the memo line and the payor\u2019s signature line. These numbers represent the bank\u2019s <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/routing_transit_number.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">routing number</a>, the payor\u2019s account number, and the check number. In certain countries, such as Canada, the routing number is replaced with an institution number\u2014which represents the bank\u2019s identifying code\u2014and the transit or branch number where the account is held.\n", "\nThe back of the check has an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/endorsement.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">endorsement</a> line for the payee\u2019s signature when the check is negotiated. The receiving bank stamps the back with a deposit stamp at the time it is negotiated, after which it goes for clearing. Once the drawing bank receives the check, it is stamped again and filed. In some cases the check is sent back to the payor if they request it.\n", "\nChecks can be used for several different purposes.\n", "\nOne example is a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/certifiedcheck.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">certified check</a>, which verifies that the drawer\u2019s account has enough funds to honor the amount of the check. In other words, the check is guaranteed not to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bouncedcheck.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bounce</a>. To certify a check, it must be presented at the bank on which it is drawn, at which time the bank will ascertain its authenticity with the payor.\n", "\nA <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashierscheck.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cashier\u2019s check</a> is guaranteed by the banking institution and signed by a bank cashier, which means the bank is responsible for the funds. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/best-ways-to-get-a-cashier-s-check-4590106\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">This type of check is often required in large transactions</a>, such as buying a car or house.\n", "\nAnother example is a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/payroll.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">payroll</a> check, or paycheck, which an employer issues to compensate an employee for their work. In recent years physical paychecks have given way to direct deposit systems and other forms of electronic transfer.\n", "\nWhen someone writes a check for an amount larger than what is held in their checking account, the check cannot be negotiated. This is referred to as a \u201cbounced check.\u201d The check bounces because it cannot be processed, as there are insufficient or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nsf.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">non-sufficient funds (NSF)</a> in the account (the two terms are interchangeable). A bounced check usually incurs a penalty fee to the payor. In some cases the payee is also charged a fee.\n"]}
