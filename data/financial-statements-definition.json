Instead, it contains three sections that report cash flow for the various activities for which a company uses its cash.

The statements are open to interpretation, and as a result, investors often draw vastly different conclusions about a company's financial performance.\n", "\nFor example, some investors might want stock repurchases while other investors might prefer to see that money invested in long-term assets. A company's debt level might be fine for one investor while another might have concerns about the level of debt for the company. When analyzing financial statements, it's important to compare multiple periods to determine if there are any trends as well as compare the company's results its peers in the same industry.\n"]}
