LTC insurance offers more flexibility and options than many public assistance programs, such as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/medicare.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Medicaid</a>.\n", "\nMany people are unable to rely on children or family members for support and buy\u00a0long-term care insurance to\u00a0help cover\u00a0out-of-pocket expenses. Otherwise, long-term care expenses would\u00a0quickly deplete the savings of an\u00a0individual and/or their family.\n", "\nWhile the costs of long-term care differ by region, it is usually very expensive. In 2019, for example, the average cost of a private room in a skilled nursing facility or nursing home was $102,200 a year, according to a report\u00a0on long-term care\u00a0by Genworth. A home health aide costs an average of $52,624 annually. <span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nIn the United States, Medicaid provides\u00a0for low-income individuals or those who spend down savings and investments because of care and exhaust their assets. Each state has its own guidelines and eligibility requirements. In most states, you can keep up to $2,000 as an individual and $3,000 for a married couple outside of your countable assets, which include checking and savings account balances, CDs, stocks, and bonds. Your home, car, personal belongings, or savings for funeral expenses don't count as assets.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nLong-term care insurance usually covers all or part of assisted living facilities and in-home care. Medicaid rarely does. Full home care coverage is an option with long-term care insurance. It will cover expenses\u00a0for a visiting or live-in\u00a0caregiver, companion, housekeeper, therapist or\u00a0private-duty nurse\u00a0up to seven days a week, 24 hours per\u00a0day, up to the policy benefit maximum.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nMany experts suggest shopping for long-term care insurance between the ages of\u00a045 and 55, as part of an overall retirement plan to protect assets from the high costs and burdens of extended healthcare. Long-term care insurance is also cheaper if you buy it younger. In 2020, the average annual premium for a couple, both 55-years-old, is $3,050, according to the American Association for Long-Term Care Insurance.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"5\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nLong-term care insurance premiums can be <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tax-deduction.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tax deductible</a> if the policy is tax-qualified and the policyholder <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/itemizeddeduction.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">itemizes</a> tax deductions, among other factors.\u00a0Usually, companies that pay long-term care premiums for an employee can deduct them as a business expense.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nDue to the high cost of this product, a number of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/100515/4-best-alternatives-longterm-care-insurance.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">alternative ways of paying for health needs</a> in later years have come on the market.
