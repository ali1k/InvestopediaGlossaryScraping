AMT uses a separate set of rules to calculate\u00a0taxable income\u00a0after allowed deductions. Preferential\u00a0deductions\u00a0are added back into the taxpayer's income to calculate his or her alternative minimum taxable income (AMTI), and then the AMT\u00a0exemption\u00a0is subtracted to determine the final taxable figure.\n", "\nThe difference between a taxpayer's AMTI and his AMT exemption is taxed using the relevant rate schedule. This yields the tentative minimum tax (TMT). If the TMT is higher than the taxpayer's regular\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxliability.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tax liability</a>\u00a0for the year, they pay\u00a0the regular tax and the amount by which the TMT exceeds the regular tax. In other words, the\u00a0taxpayer\u00a0pays the full TMT.\n", "\nFor tax year 2020, the AMT exemption for individual filers is $72,900. <span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"5\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeffFor married joint filers, the figure is $113,400. For tax year 2021, the figures are $73,600 for individuals and $114,600 for couples.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nTaxpayers have to complete <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/form-6251.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Form 6251</a> to see whether they might owe AMT. First,\u00a0they get to subtract the exemption amount. If their AMT\u00a0is less than the exemption, they do not have to pay AMT.\n", "\nIt's important to note, though, that taxpayers with AMTI over a certain threshold do not qualify for the AMT exemption. For tax year 2020, the phase-out begins at $518,400 for individuals and $1,036,800 for couples filing jointly.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"5\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff For tax year 2021, it begins to phase out at $523,600, or $1,047,200 for couples filing jointly.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nAMT is designed to prevent taxpayers from escaping their fair share of tax liability through\u00a0tax breaks. However, the structure was not indexed to inflation or tax cuts. This can cause bracket creep, a condition in which upper-middle-income taxpayers are subject to this tax instead of just the wealthy taxpayers for whom AMT was invented. In 2015, however, Congress passed a law indexing the AMT exemption amount to inflation.\n", "\nTo determine if they owe AMT, individuals can use <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/best-tax-software-5069775\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tax software </a>that automatically does the calculation, or they can fill out\u00a0IRS\u00a0Form 6251. This form takes medical expenses, home mortgage interest, and several other miscellaneous deductions into account to help\u00a0tax filers determine if their deductions are beyond an overall limit set by the IRS.\n", "\nThe form also requests information on certain types of income such as tax refunds, investment interest, and interest from private activity bonds, as well as numbers corresponding with\u00a0capital gains or losses related to the disposition of property. The IRS has specific formulas in place to determine which portion of this income and deductions the tax filers need to note on Form 6251, and it uses another set of formulas to determine how these numbers lead to AMTI.\n"]}
