Secular can also point to\u00a0specific stocks or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sector.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">stock sectors</a> unaffected by short-term trends.

When applying the term to the stock market, a secular market is the market's overarching trend or direction for five years or more. Further, secular trends may be upward or downward in direction.\n", "\nIt is important for investors to identify secular trends in markets, not just short-term trends, to develop a long-term <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investmentstrategy.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">investment strategy</a>. Examples of secular trends include an aging population, which tends to\u00a0have different spending and savings habits than a younger population, the expansion of a particular technology such as\u00a0the internet,\u00a0the clean-energy movement, and the growth in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/impact-investing.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">impact investing</a>.\n", "\nWithin the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockmarket.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">stock market</a>, experts consider\u00a0technology companies such as Netflix and Google\u00a0parent Alphabet secular because\u00a0short-term economic trends have a minimal\u00a0lasting impact on their long-term performance. David Kostin of Goldman Sachs, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/16/goldman-not-much-upside-left-for-the-market-here-but-these-secular-growth-stocks-should-boom.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">as reported by <em>CNBC</em> in March of 2018</a>, came up with a list of the best secular growth stocks prime for investment. The short-list includes internet companies Amazon and Google's Alphabet as well as Domino's Pizza and Summit Materials. Goldman chose these companies because they grew sales by over 10% over the three previous years and have robust and forward-looking potential.\n", "\nA stock is\u00a0secular when the associated company <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earnings.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">earnings</a> remain constant regardless of other trends occurring within the market.

Consumer staples can include personal care items, such as shampoo and toilet paper,\u00a0various food-item producers, and certain pharmaceutical companies.\n", "\nSecular movements can proceed in either a positive or negative direction. Therefore, the term does not always mean growth. Investors may be secular <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bear.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bears</a> or secular <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bull.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bulls</a>.\n", "\nAlso, secular can refer to subtle or dramatic movements as the term does not identify\u00a0the degree of\u00a0change. The defining characteristics are\u00a0the long-term nature of the movement and the lack of impact of short-term trends on associated activity.\n", "\nIn his book, <em>Stocks for the Long Run (McGraw-Hill Education, 5th edition</em>, 2014), Jeremy Siegel, an economics Ph.D., and finance professor at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, argues that equity securities\u2013particularly U.S. equities\u2013are secular and will likely outperform the other major <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetclasses.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">asset classes</a> secularly\u00a0or over the long term.\n", "\nIn support of his argument, Siegel points to the 130 years between 1871 and 2001. During any rolling 30-year period within this timeframe, stocks outperformed all other asset classes, especially <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bonds</a> and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurybill.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">T-bills</a>. Most experts agree that a 30-year period constitutes a secular trend.\n"]}
