The consumer is ultimately paying the tax by paying more for the product.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nIndirect taxes are defined by contrasting them with <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/directtax.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">direct taxes</a>. Indirect taxes can be defined as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxation.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">taxation</a> on an individual or entity, which is ultimately paid for by another person. The body that collects the tax will then remit it to the government.\u00a0But in the case of direct taxes, the person immediately paying the tax is the person that the government is seeking to tax.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nExcise duties on fuel, liquor, and cigarettes are all considered examples of indirect taxes.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff By contrast, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incometax.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">income tax</a> is the clearest example of a direct tax, since the person earning the income is the one immediately paying the tax. Admission fees to a national park are another clear example of direct taxation.\n", "\nSome indirect taxes are also\u00a0referred to as consumption taxes, such as a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valueaddedtax.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">value-added tax (VAT)</a>.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\u00a0\u00a0\n", "\nIndirect taxes are commonly used and imposed by the government\u00a0in order to generate <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/revenue.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">revenue</a>. They\u00a0are essentially fees that are levied equally upon <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxpayer.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">taxpayers</a>, no matter their income, so rich or poor, everyone has to pay them.\n", "\nBut many consider them to be\u00a0regressive taxes as\u00a0they can bear a heavy burden on people with lower incomes who end up paying the same amount of tax as\u00a0those who make a higher income.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nFor example, the import duty on a television from Japan will be the same amount, no matter the income of the consumer purchasing the television. And because this levy has nothing to do with a person's income, that means someone who earns $25,000 a year will have to pay the same duty on the same television as someone who earns $150,000; clearly, a bigger burden on the former.\u00a0\n", "\nThere are also concerns that indirect taxes can be used to further a particular government policy by taxing certain industries and not others. For this reason, some <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economist.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">economists</a> argue that indirect taxes lead to an inefficient marketplace and alter <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market-price.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">market prices</a> from their equilibrium price.\n", "\nThe most common example of\u00a0an indirect tax is <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/import-duty.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">import duties</a>. The duty is paid by the importer of a good at the time it enters the country. If the importer goes on to resell the good to a consumer, the cost of the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duty.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">duty</a>,\u00a0in effect,\u00a0is hidden in the price that the consumer pays. The consumer is likely to be unaware of this, but they will nonetheless be indirectly paying the import duty.\n", "\nEssentially, any taxes or fees imposed by the government at the manufacturing or production level is an indirect tax. In recent years, many countries have imposed fees on carbon emissions to manufacturers. These are indirect taxes since their costs are passed along to consumers.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/salestax.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sales taxes</a> can be direct or indirect. If they are imposed only on the final supply to a consumer, they are direct. If they are imposed as value-added taxes (VATs) along the production process, then they are indirect.\n"]}
