That fact suggests EU migrants are greater contributors to the economy than their U.K. counterparts; then again, \"Leave\" supporters read these data as pointing to foreign competition for scarce jobs in Britain.\n", "\nThe \"Brexit bill\" is the financial settlement the U.K. owes\u00a0Brussels following its withdrawal.\n", "\nThe Withdrawal Agreement doesn't mention a specific figure, but it is estimated to be up to \u00a332.8 billion, according to Downing Street.

The revised deal says the entire U.K. will leave the EU customs union upon Brexit, but Northern Ireland will follow EU regulations and VAT laws when it comes to goods and the U.K. government will collect the VAT on behalf of the EU. This means there will be limited customs border in the Irish Sea with checks at major ports. Four years after the end of the transition period, the Northern Ireland assembly will be able to vote on this arrangement.\n", "\nThe backstop emerged as the main reason for the Brexit impasse. It was a guarantee that there would be no \"hard border\" between Northern Ireland and Ireland. It was an insurance policy that kept Britain in the EU customs union with Northern Ireland following EU single market rules. The backstop, which was meant to temporary and superseded by a subsequent agreement, could only be removed if both Britain and the EU gave their consent.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"24\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff May was unable to garner enough support for her deal due to it. Euroskeptic MPs wanted her to add legally binding changes as they feared it would compromise the country's autonomy and could last indefinitely. EU leaders have so far refused to remove it and have also ruled out a time limit or granting Britain the power to remove it. On March 11, 2019, the two sides signed a pact in Strasbourg that did not change the Withdrawal Agreement but added \"meaningful legal assurances.\"<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"25\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff It wasn't enough to convince hardline Brexiteers.\n", "\nFor decades during the second half of the\u00a020th century, violence between Protestants and Catholics marred Northern Ireland, and the border between the U.K. countryside and the Republic of Ireland to the south was militarized. The 1998 Good Friday Agreement\u00a0turned the border almost invisible, except for speed limit signs, which switch from miles per hour in the north to kilometers per hour in the south.\u00a0\n", "\nBoth U.K. and EU negotiators worry about the consequences of reinstating border controls, as Britain may have to do in order to end freedom of movement from the EU. Yet leaving the customs union without imposing customs checks at the Northern Irish border or between Northern Ireland and the rest of Britain leaves the door wide open for smuggling. This significant and unique challenge is one of the reasons that \"soft Brexit\" advocates most cite in favor of staying in the EU's\u00a0customs union and perhaps its single market. In other words, the Northern Ireland conundrum may have created a back door for a soft Brexit.\u00a0\n", "\nThe issue is further\u00a0complicated by the Tories' choice of the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party as a coalition partner: the DUP\u00a0opposed the Good Friday Agreement and\u2014unlike the Conservatives' leader at the time\u2014campaigned for Brexit. Under the Good Friday Agreement, the U.K. government is required to oversee Northern Ireland with \"rigorous impartiality\"; that may prove difficult for a government that depends on the cooperation of a party with an overwhelmingly Protestant support base\u00a0and historical connections to Protestant paramilitary groups.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"26\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\n\"Leave\" voters based their support for Brexit on a variety of factors, including the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/european-sovereign-debt-crisis.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">European debt crisis</a>,\u00a0immigration, terrorism and the perceived drag of Brussels' bureaucracy on the U.K. economy. Britain has long been wary of the European Union's projects, which Leavers feel threatens the U.K.'s sovereignty: the country never opted into\u00a0the European Union's monetary union, meaning that it uses the pound\u00a0instead of the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/euro.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">euro</a>.

One is the risk involved in pulling out of the EU's decision-making process, given that it is by far the largest destination for U.K. exports. Another is the economic and societal benefits of the EU's \"four freedoms\": the free movement of goods, services, capital and people across borders. A common thread in both arguments is that leaving the EU would destabilize the U.K. economy in the short term and make the country poorer in the long term. In July of\u00a02018, May's cabinet suffered another shake-up when Boris Johnson resigned as the U.K.'s Foreign Minister and David Davis resigned as Brexit\u00a0Minister over May's plans to keep close ties to the EU.

The Scottish National Party (SNP) lost 21 seats in the Westminster Parliament, and on June 27, 2017, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said her government at Holyrood would \"reset\" its timetable on independence to focus on delivering a \"soft Brexit.\"<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"53\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nNot one Scottish local area voted to leave the EU, according to the U.K.'s Electoral Commission, though Moray came close at 49.9%. The country as a whole rejected the referendum by 62.0% to 38.0%.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"54\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff Because Scotland only contains 8.4% of the U.K.'s population, however, its vote to Remain\u2014along with that of Northern Ireland, which accounts for just 2.9% of the U.K.'s population\u2014was vastly outweighed by support for Brexit in England and Wales.\n", "\nScotland joined England and Wales to form Great Britain in 1707, and the relationship has been tumultuous at times. The SNP, which was founded in the 1930s,\u00a0had just six of 650 seats in Westminster in 2010. The following year, however, it formed a majority government in the devolved Scottish Parliament at\u00a0Holyrood, partly owing to its the promise to hold a referendum on Scottish independence.\u00a0\n", "\nThat referendum, held in 2014, saw the pro-independence side lose with 44.7% of the vote; turnout was 84.6%.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"55\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff Far from putting the independence issue to rest, though, the vote fired up support for the nationalists. The SNP won 56 of 59 Scottish seats at Westminster the following year, overtaking the Lib Dems to become the third-largest party in the U.K. overall. Britain's electoral map suddenly showed a glaring divide between England and Wales\u2014dominated by Tory blue with the occasional patch of\u00a0Labour red\u2014and all-yellow Scotland.\n", "\nWhen Britain voted to leave the EU, Scotland fulminated. A combination of rising nationalism and strong support for Europe led almost immediately to calls for a new independence referendum. When the Supreme Court ruled on Nov. 3, 2017, that devolved national assemblies such as Scotland's parliament cannot veto Brexit, the demands grew louder. On March 13 that year, Sturgeon called for a second referendum, to be held in the autumn of 2018 or spring of 2019. Holyrood\u00a0backed her by a vote of 69 to 59 on March 28, the day before May's government triggered Article 50.\n", "\nSturgeon's preferred timing is significant since the two-year countdown initiated by <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/article-50.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Article 50</a> will end in the spring of 2019 when the politics surrounding Brexit could be particularly volatile.\n", "\nScotland's economic situation also raises questions about its hypothetical future as an independent country. The crash in the oil price has dealt a blow to government finances. In May 2014 it forecast 2015\u20132016 tax receipts from North Sea drilling of \u00a33.4 billion to\u00a0\u00a39 billion but collected\u00a0\u00a360 million, less than 1% of the forecasts' midpoint. In reality, these figures are hypothetical, since Scotland's finances are not fully devolved, but the estimates are based on the country's geographical share of North Sea drilling, so they illustrate what it might expect as an independent nation.\n", "\nThe debate over what currency an independent Scotland would use has been revived. Former SNP leader Alex Salmond, who was Scotland's First Minister until Nov. 2014, told the Financial Times that the country could abandon the pound and introduce its own currency, allowing it to float freely or pegging it to sterling. He ruled out joining the euro, but others contend that it would be required for Scotland to join the EU.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"56\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff Another possibility would be to use the pound, which would mean forfeiting control over <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monetarypolicy.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">monetary policy</a>.\n", "\nOn the other hand, a weak currency that floats on global markets can be a boon to U.K. producers who export goods.

While leaving the Eurozone will mean that the U.K. will no longer have unfettered access to Europe's single market, it will allow for more focus on trade with India. India will also have more room for maneuvering if the U.K. is no longer abiding by European trade rules and regulations.\n", "\nMay advocated a \"hard\" Brexit, meaning that Britain would leave the EU's single market and customs union, then negotiate a\u00a0trade deal to govern their future relationship. These negotiations would have been conducted during a transition period that will begin when a divorce deal is ratified. The Conservatives' poor showing in the June 2017 snap election called popular support for a hard Brexit into question, and many in the press speculated that the government could take a softer line. The Brexit White Paper released in July 2018 revealed plans for a softer Brexit. It was too soft for many MPs belonging to her party and too audacious for the EU.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"57\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nThe White Paper says the government plans to leave EU single market and customs union. However, it proposes the creation of a free trade area for goods which would \"avoid the need for customs and regulatory checks at the border and mean that businesses would not need to complete costly customs declarations. And it would enable products to only undergo one set of approvals and authorizations in either market, before being sold in both.\" This means the U.K. will follow EU single market rules when it comes to goods.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"58\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nThe White Paper acknowledged that a borderless customs arrangement with the EU\u2014one that allowed the U.K. to negotiate free trade agreements with third countries\u2014is \"broader in scope than any other that exists between the EU and a third country.\"<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"59\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nThe government is right that there is no example of this kind of relationship in Europe today. The four broad precedents that do exist are the EU's relationship with Norway, Switzerland, Canada, and World Trade Organization members.\n", "\nThe first option would be for the U.K. to join Norway, Iceland, and Lichtenstein in the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/european-economic-area-eea-agreement.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">European Economic Area</a> (EEA), which provides access to the EU's single market for most goods and services (agriculture and fisheries are excluded). At the same time, the EEA is outside the customs union, so Britain could enter into trade deals with non-EU countries. The arrangement is hardly a win-win, however: the U.K. would be bound by some EU laws while losing its ability to influence those laws through the country's European Council and European Parliament voting rights. In Sept. 2017, May called this arrangement an unacceptable \"loss of democratic control.\"<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"60\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nDavid Davis expressed interest in the Norway model in response to a question he received at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington. \"It's something we've thought about but it's not at the top of our list.\"<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"61\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff He was referring specifically to\u00a0the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), which like the EEA offers access to the single market, but not the customs union. EFTA was once a large organization, but most of its members have left to join the EU. Today it comprises\u00a0Norway, Iceland, Lichtenstein, and Switzerland; all but Switzerland are also members of the EEA.\n", "\nSwitzerland's relationship to the EU, which is governed by around 20 major bilateral pacts with the bloc, is broadly similar to the EEA\u00a0arrangement. Along with these three, Switzerland is a member of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). Switzerland helped set up the EEA, but its people rejected membership in a 1992 referendum.\u00a0\n", "\nThe country allows free movement of people and is a member of the passport-free Schengen\u00a0Area.\u00a0It is subject to many single market rules, without having much say in making them. It is outside the customs union, allowing it to negotiate free trade agreements with third countries; usually, but not always, it has negotiated\u00a0alongside the EEA countries. Switzerland\u00a0has access to the single market for goods (with the exception of agriculture), but not services (with the exception of insurance). It pays a modest amount into the EU's budget.\u00a0\n", "\nBrexit\u00a0supporters who want to \"take back control\" would be unlikely to embrace the concessions the Swiss have made on immigration, budget payments, and single market rules. The EU would probably not want a relationship modeled on the Swiss example, either: Switzerland's membership in EFTA but not the EEA, Schengen but not the EU, is a messy product of the complex history of European integration and\u2014what else\u2014a referendum.\n", "\nA third option is to negotiate a free trade agreement with the EU along the lines of\u00a0the\u00a0Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), a pact the EU has finalized with Canada but not ratified. The most obvious problem with this approach is that the U.K. has only two years from the triggering of Article 50 to negotiate such a deal. The EU has refused to discuss a future trading relationship until December at the earliest.\u00a0\n", "\nTo give a sense of how tight that timetable is, CETA negotiations began in 2009 and were concluded in 2014. Three years later, a small minority of the EU's 28 national parliaments have ratified the deal. Persuading the rest could take years. Even subnational legislatures can stand in the way of a deal:\u00a0the Walloon regional parliament, which represents fewer than 4 million mainly French-speaking Belgians, single-handedly blocked CETA\u00a0for a few days in\u00a02016. In order to extend the two-year deadline for leaving the EU, Britain would need unanimous approval from the EU 27. Several U.K. politicians, including Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond, have stressed the need for a transitional deal of a few years so that\u2014among other reasons\u2014Britain can negotiate EU and third country trade deals; the notion has met with resistance from hard-line Brexiteers, however.\n", "\nIn some\u00a0ways, comparing Britain's situation to Canada's is misleading. Canada already enjoys free trade with the United States through\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nafta.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NAFTA</a>, meaning that a trade deal with the EU is not\u00a0as crucial\u00a0as it is\u00a0for the U.K. Canada's and Britain's economies are also very different: CETA does not include financial services, one of Britain's biggest exports to the EU.\n", "\nSpeaking in Florence in Sept. 2017, May said the U.K. and EU \"can do so much better\" than a CETA-style trade agreement, since they're beginning from the \"unprecedented position\" of sharing a body of rules and regulations. She did not elaborate on what \"much better\" would look like, besides calling on both parties\u00a0to be \"creative as well as practical.\"<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"60\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nMonique Ebell, formerly of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research stresses that even with an agreement in place, non-tariff barriers are likely to be a significant drag Britain's trade with the EU: she expects total U.K. foreign trade\u2014not just flows to and from the EU\u2014under an EU-U.K. trade pact. She reasons that free-trade deals do not generally handle services trade well. Services are a major component of Britain's international trade;\u00a0the country enjoys a trade surplus in that segment, which is not the case for goods. Free trade deals also struggle to rein in non-tariff barriers. Admittedly Britain and the EU are starting from a unified regulatory scheme, but divergences will only multiply post-Brexit.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"47\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\n<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"62\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nYou want out? You're out. If Britain and the EU cannot come to an agreement regarding a future relationship, they will revert to the World Trade Organization (WTO) terms. Even this default would not be entirely straightforward, however. Since Britain is currently a WTO member through the EU, it will have to split tariff schedules with the bloc and divvy out liabilities arising from\u00a0ongoing trade disputes. This work has already begun.\n", "\nTrading with the EU on WTO terms is the \"no-deal\" scenario the Conservative government has presented as an acceptable fallback\u2014though most observers see this as a negotiating tactic. U.K. Secretary of State for International Trade Liam Fox said in July 2017, \"People talk about the WTO\u00a0as if it would be the end of the world. But they forget that is how they currently trade with the United States, with China, with Japan, with India, with the Gulf, and our trading relationship is strong and healthy.\"<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"63\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nFor certain industries, however, the EU's external tariff would hit hard: Britain exports\u00a077% of the cars it manufactures, and 58% of these go to Europe. The EU levies 10% tariffs on imported cars. Monique Ebell of the NIESR\u00a0estimated that leaving the EU single market would reduce overall U.K. goods and services trade\u2014not just that with the EU\u2014by 22\u201330%.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"47\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nNor will the U.K. only be giving up its trade arrangements with the EU: under any of the scenarios above, it will probably\u00a0lose the trade agreements the bloc has struck 63 third countries, as well as progress in negotiating other deals. Replacing these and adding new ones is an uncertain prospect. In a Sept. 2017 interview with Politico, Trade Secretary Liam Fox said his office\u2014formed in July 2016\u2014has turned away some third countries looking to negotiate free trade deals because it lacks\u00a0the capacity\u00a0to negotiate.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"64\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nFox wants to roll the terms of existing\u00a0EU trade deals over into new agreements, but some countries may be unwilling to give Britain (66 million people, $2.6 trillion GDP) the same terms as the EU\u00a0(excluding Britain, around 440 million people, $13.9 trillion GDP).<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"64\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\n<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"65\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nNegotiations with third countries are technically not allowed while Britain remains an EU member, but even so informal talks have begun, particularly with the U.S.\n", "\nCompanies in the U.S. across a wide variety of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sector.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sectors</a> have made large investments in the U.K. over many years.
