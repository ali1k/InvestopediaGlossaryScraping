A voucher is essentially the backup document for accounts payable. Accounts payable are the short-term bills owed by companies to vendors and suppliers.\n", "\nThe voucher is important because it's an internal <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accounting-control.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">accounting control</a> mechanism that ensures that every payment is properly authorized and that the goods or services purchased are actually received.\n", "\nCompanies have various short-term financial obligations to suppliers and vendors throughout an accounting period. A company might need to buy inventory or raw materials from suppliers that are used in the production of the company's goods. The suppliers essentially grant an extension of credit to the company allowing for payment to be made in the near future such as 30, 60, or 90 days.\n", "\nA voucher is a form that includes all of the supporting documents showing the money owed and any payments to a supplier or vendor for an outstanding payable. The voucher and the necessary documents are recorded in the voucher register. Some of the supporting documents in a voucher can include:\n", "\nThe total amount of all the vouchers that have outstanding balances owed are recorded as accounts payable on the balance sheet. Once the voucher has been paid, the proof of payment is included in the voucher and recorded as a paid voucher.\n", "\nThe company\u2019s vouchers serve as a key source of evidence when an audit is performed. An <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/auditor.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">auditor</a> performs a set of procedures to determine if the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-statements.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">financial statements</a> are free of material misstatement. Vouchers document that the goods purchased were actually received, which supports the auditor\u2019s assertion that the goods and services posted to the financial statements truly exist. Vouchers also justify the firm\u2019s cash payments to vendors and documents the general ledger accounts used to post the transaction.\n", "\nUsing a voucher system also reduces the risk of employees colluding to steal company assets. Businesses employ segregation of duties to prevent employee theft, which means that critical tasks are assigned to different people within the organization. The voucher documents that the tasks are performed by multiple people and creates a paper trail so that an auditor can confirm that the duties were properly segregated.\n", "\nA local restaurant orders meat and fish every few days from its vendors. The restaurant manager fills out a purchase order for 30 pounds of meat, and the owner initials the purchase order to approve the shipment. When the shipment is received, the contents of the shipment are compared with the purchase order to ensure that the shipment matches what was ordered. The restaurant completes a shipping receipt to document the process, and the shipping receipt is compared with the vendor\u2019s invoice.\n", "\nThe voucher, which is a cover page that explains the attached documents, includes the purchase order, shipping receipt, and the invoice. The purchase amount is added and recorded to accounts payable on the balance sheet until paid. The owner reviews all the voucher information before signing a check.\n", "\nThe voucher also includes the general ledger accounts used to record the transaction. The restaurant, for example, can debit the meat inventory account and credit the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashaccount.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cash account</a> to record the payment. The receipt of payment and the date is recorded to show that the voucher has been paid. Accounts payable will reflect the lower balance due to the invoice being paid, assuming there are no additional payables generated.\n"]}
