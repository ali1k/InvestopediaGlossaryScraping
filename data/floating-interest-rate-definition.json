It can also be referred to as a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/variableinterestrate.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">variable interest rate</a> because it can vary over the duration of the debt obligation. This contrasts with a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixedinterestrate.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fixed interest rate</a>, in which the interest rate of a debt obligation stays constant for the duration of the loan's term.\n", "\nResidential mortgages can be obtained with either fixed or floating interest rates. With fixed interest rates, the mortgage interest rate is static and cannot change for the duration of the mortgage agreement. With floating or variable interests rates, the mortgage interest rates can change periodically with the market.\n", "\nFor example, if someone takes out a fixed-rate mortgage with a 4% interest rate, the individual will pay that rate for the lifetime of the loan, and the payments will be the same throughout the loan term. In contrast, if a borrower takes out a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/variable-rate-mortgage.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mortgage with a variable rate</a>, it may start with a 4% rate and then adjust, either up or down, changing the monthly payments.\n", "\nIn most cases, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/arm.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs)</a> have rates that adjust based on a preset margin and a major mortgage index such as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/libor.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LIBOR</a>, the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/cofi.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cost of funds index</a> (COFI), or the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mtaindex.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Monthly Treasury Average (MTA)</a>. For example, if an individual takes out an ARM with a 2% margin based on LIBOR, and LIBOR is at 3% when the mortgage's rate adjusts, the rate resets at 5% (the margin plus the index).\n", "\nARMs tend to have lower introductory interest rates than fixed-rate mortgages, and that can make them more appealing to some borrowers. Those who plan to sell the property and repay the loan before the rate adjusts or borrowers who expect their <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equity.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">equity</a> to increase quickly as home values increase may choose an ARM.\n", "\nThe other advantage is that floating interest rates may float down, thus lowering the borrower's monthly payments. The key disadvantage is that the rate may float upward and increase the borrower's monthly payments.\n", "\nMortgages are not the only type of loans that can have floating interest rates. Most credit cards also have floating interest rates. As with mortgages, these rates are tied to an index. In most cases, the index is the current <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/primerate.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">prime rate</a>, the rate that directly reflects the interest rate set by the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalreservesystem.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Federal Reserve</a> several times per year. Most credit card agreements state that the interest rate charged to the borrower is the prime rate plus a certain spread.\n"]}
