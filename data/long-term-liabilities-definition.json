The current portion of long-term debt is listed separately to provide a more accurate view of a company's current <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp\">liquidity</a> and the company\u2019s ability to pay current liabilities as they become due. Long-term liabilities are also called long-term debt or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/noncurrent-liabilities.asp\">noncurrent liabilities</a>.\n", "\nLong-term liabilities are listed in the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancesheet.asp\">balance sheet</a> after more current liabilities, in a section that may include <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debenture.asp\">debentures</a>, loans, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deferredtaxliability.asp\">deferred tax liabilities</a>, and pension obligations. Long-term liabilities are obligations not due within the next 12 months or within the company\u2019s operating cycle if it is longer than one year. A company\u2019s operating cycle is the time it takes to turn its <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inventory.asp\">inventory</a> into cash.\n", "\nAn exception to the above two options relates to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentliabilities.asp\">current liabilities</a> being refinanced into long-term liabilities. If the intent to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/refinance.asp\">refinance</a> is present and there is evidence that the refinancing has begun, a company may report current liabilities as long-term liabilities because after the refinancing, the obligations are no longer due within 12 months. In addition, a liability that is coming due but has a corresponding long-term investment intended to be used as payment for the debt is reported as a long-term liability. The long-term investment must have sufficient funds to cover the debt.\n", "\nThe long-term portion of a bond payable is reported as a long-term liability. Because a bond typically covers many years, the majority of a bond payable is long term. The <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/presentvalue.asp\">present value</a> of a lease payment that extends past one year is a long-term liability. Deferred tax liabilities typically extend to future tax years, in which case they are considered a long-term liability. Mortgages, car payments, or other loans for machinery, equipment, or land are long term, except for the payments to be made in the coming 12 months. The portion due within one year is classified on the balance sheet as a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentportionlongtermdebt.asp\">current portion of long-term debt. </a>\n", "\nLong-term liabilities are a useful tool for management analysis in the application of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0910/6-basic-financial-ratios-and-what-they-tell-you.aspx\">financial ratios</a>. The current portion of long-term debt is separated out because it needs to be covered by more liquid <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp\">assets</a>, such as cash.
