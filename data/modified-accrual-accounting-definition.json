An economic event is recorded in the short-term when the cash balance has been affected. The result of this rule is that almost all items recorded on the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incomestatement.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">income statement</a> are recorded using the cash basis, and items including accounts receivable and inventory are not recorded on the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancesheet.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">balance sheet</a>.\n", "\nEconomic events expected to impact multiple reporting periods are recorded using rules similar to the accrual method.

Governmental agencies have two key objectives: to report whether current-year revenues are sufficient enough to finance current-year expenses, and to demonstrate whether resources are being used according to legally adopted budgets.\n", "\nModified accrual accounting ticks those boxes. It enables government agencies to focus on short-term financial assets and liabilities. It also permits them to divide available funds into separate entities within the organization to ensure that money is being spent where it was intended.\n"]}
