Generally, these funds stick to a relatively fixed mix of stocks and bonds. Balanced mutual funds have holdings that are balanced between equity and debt, with their objective somewhere between growth and income. This leads to the name \"balanced fund.\"\n", "\nBalanced mutual funds are geared toward investors who are looking for a mixture of safety, income, and modest capital appreciation.\n", "\nA balanced fund is a type of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hybridfund.asp\">hybrid fund,</a> which is an investment fund characterized by its diversification among two or more asset classes. The amounts the fund invests into each <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetclasses.asp\">asset class</a> usually must remain within a set minimum and maximum value. Another name for a balanced fund is an asset allocation fund.\n", "\nBalanced fund portfolios do not materially change their asset mix, unlike life-cycle, target-date, and actively-managed asset allocation funds which evolve in response to the investor's changing risk-return appetite and age or overall investment market conditions.\n", "\nTypically, retirees or investors with low-risk tolerance utilize balanced funds for healthy growth and supplemental income. The equities component helps to prevent erosion of purchasing power and ensure the long-term preservation of retirement nest eggs. Historically, inflation averages around 3% annually, while the S&amp;P 500 index averaged about 10% between 1928 and 2018. The equity holdings of a balanced fund lean toward large, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp\">dividend</a>-paying companies and equity issues whose long-term total returns track the S&amp;P 500 Index.\n", "\nThe <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp\">bond</a> component of a balanced fund serves two purposes.\n", "\nInvestment-grade bonds such as AAA corporate debt and U.S. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/ustreasury.asp\">Treasuries</a> provide interest income through semi-annual payments, while large-company stocks offer quarterly dividend payouts to enhance yield. Also, rather than reinvest distributions, retired investors may receive cash to bolster their income from pensions, personal savings, and government subsidies.\n", "\nWhile they trade daily, highly graded bonds and Treasuries don't experience the price swings that equities experience. So, the stability of the fixed-interest securities prevents wild jumps in the share price of a balanced mutual fund. Also, debt security prices do not move in lockstep with stocks\u2014they often move in the opposite direction. This bond stability provides balanced funds with ballast, further smoothing out its portfolio's net asset value.\n", "\nBecause balanced funds rarely have to change their mix of stocks and bonds, they tend to have lower total <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expenseratio.asp\">expense ratios</a> (ERs). Moreover, because they automatically spread an investor's money across a variety of types of stocks, they minimize the risk of selecting the wrong stocks or sectors. Finally, balanced funds allow investors to withdraw money periodically without upsetting the asset allocation.\n", "\nOn the downside, the fund controls the asset allocation, not you\u2014and that might not always match with the optimal tax-planning moves. For example, many investors prefer to keep income-producing securities in tax-advantaged accounts and growth stocks in taxable ones, but you can't separate the two in a balanced fund. You can't use a bond laddering strategy\u2014 buying bonds with staggered maturity dates\u2014to adjust cash flows and repayment of principal according to your financial situation.\n", "\nThe characteristic allocation of a balanced fund\u2014usually 60% equities, 40% debt\u2014may not always suit you, as your investment goals, needs, or preferences change over time. And some professionals fear that balanced funds play it too safe, avoiding international or outside-the-mainstream market and thus hobbling their returns.\n", "\nThe Vanguard Balanced Index Fund (VBINX) has a below-average risk rating from Morningstar with an above-average reward profile. Through 10 years ending January 10, 2020, the fund, holding about 60% stocks and 40% bonds, has returned 9.54% on average with a 2.02% trailing 12-month yield. The Vanguard Balanced Index Fund has an expense ratio of only 0.18%.\n"]}
