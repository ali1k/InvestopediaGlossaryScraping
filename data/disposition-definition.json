The most common form of a disposition would be selling a stock investment on the open market, such as a stock exchange.\n", "\nOther types of dispositions include <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/charitable-donations-4689691\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">donations to charities</a> or trusts, the sale of real estate, either land or a building, or any other financial asset. Still, other forms of dispositions involve transfers and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assignment.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">assignments</a>.

Most likely, they would sell their shares through a broker on a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/04/092404.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">stock exchange</a>.

Mostly this is done for tax and accounting purposes, where the transfer or assignment relieves the disposer of tax or other liabilities.\n", "\nFor example, if an investor purchased stock for $5,000 and the investment grew to $15,000, the investor can avoid the capital gains tax on their profit by donating it to a charity. The investor is then able to include the entire $15,000 as a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tax-deduction.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tax deduction</a>.\n", "\nBusinesses also dispose of assets, and very often, of entire business segments or units. This is commonly known as divestiture and can be done through a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spinoff.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">spinoff</a>, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/split-up.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">split-up</a>, or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/split-off.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">split-off</a>.\n", "\nThe <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) has very specific guidelines on how these dispositions must be reported and handled. If the disposition is not reported in the financial statements of a company, then <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proforma.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pro forma</a> financial statements are required if the disposition meets the requirements of a significance test.\n", "\n\"Significance\" is determined by either an income test or an investment test. An investment test measures the investment value in the unit being disposed of compared to total assets. If the amount is more than 10% as of the most recent fiscal year-end, then it is considered significant.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff\n", "\nThe income test measures if the \"equity in the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/income.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">income</a> from continuing operations before taxes, extraordinary items, and cumulative effects of changes in accounting principles\" is 10% or more of such income of the most recent fiscal year-end.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff In certain situations, the threshold level can be increased to 20%.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/behavioraleconomics.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Behavioral economics</a> also has something to say about one's propensity to sell a winning vs. losing position based on the concept of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/loss-psychology.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">loss aversion</a>. The \"disposition effect\" is a term that describes investor behavior in which they have a tendency to sell winning investments too early before realizing all potential gains while holding on to losing investments for longer than they should, hoping that the investments will turn around and generate a profit.\n", "\nThis effect was first introduced by Hersh Shefrin and Meir Statman in 1985 in their paper, \"The Disposition to Sell Winners Too Early and Ride Losers Too Long: Theory and Evidence.\" Studies show that investors should do the exact opposite of what the disposition effect states they tend to do.\n"]}
