The foreign tax credit is available to anyone who either works in a foreign country or has investment income from a foreign source.\n", "\nThe foreign tax credit is a tax break provided by the government to reduce the tax liability of certain taxpayers.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff A <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxcredit.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tax credit</a> is applied to the amount of tax owed by the taxpayer after all deductions are made from their <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxableincome.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">taxable income</a>, and it reduces the total tax bill of an individual dollar to dollar.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff If an individual owes $3,000 to the government and is eligible for a $1,100 tax credit, they will only have to pay $1,900 after the credit is applied. A tax credit can be either refundable or non-refundable. A <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/refundablecredit.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">refundable tax credit</a> usually results in a refund check if the tax credit is more than the individual's tax bill. A taxpayer who applies a $3,400 tax credit to their $3,000 tax bill will have their bill reduced to zero, and the remaining portion of the credit, that is $400, refunded to them.\n", "\nOn the other hand, a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nonrefundabletaxcredit.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">non-refundable tax credit</a> does not result in a refund to the taxpayer as it will only reduce the tax owed to zero. Following the example above, if the $3,400 tax credit was non-refundable, the individual will owe nothing to the government, but will also forfeit the amount of $400 that remains after the credit is applied. The most commonly claimed tax credits are non-refundable, one of which is the foreign tax credit.\u00a0\n", "\nThe foreign tax credit applies to taxpayers who pay tax on their foreign <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investmentincome.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">investment income</a> to a foreign government.
