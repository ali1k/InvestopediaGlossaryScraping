The SEZ\u00a0economic regulations tend to be conducive to\u2014and attract\u2014<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fdi.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">foreign direct investment</a> (FDI). FDI refers to any investment made by a firm or individual in one country into business interests located in another country.\n", "\nWhen a country or individual conducts business in an SEZ, there are typically additional economic advantages for them, including\u00a0tax incentives and the opportunity to pay <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/tariffs/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lower tariffs</a>.\n", "\nSEZs are usually created in order to facilitate rapid <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economicgrowth.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">economic growth</a> in certain geographic regions. This economic growth is accomplished by leveraging tax incentives as a way of attracting foreign dollars and technological advancement.\n", "\nSEZs\u00a0may also increase export levels for the implementing country and other countries that supply\u00a0it with intermediate products. However, there is a risk\u00a0that countries may abuse the system and use it to retain <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/protectionism.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">protectionist</a> barriers (in the form of taxes and fees). SEZs can also create a high level of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bureaucracy.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bureaucracy</a> due to their regulatory requirements. This can have the effect of funneling money away from the system, making it less efficient.\n", "\nWhile there are benefits for businesses, individuals, or entities operating within an\u00a0SEZ, the macroeconomic and socioeconomic benefits for a country using an\u00a0SEZ strategy are subject to debate.\n", "\nThe first SEZs appeared in the late 1950s in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042015/how-can-industrialization-affect-national-economy-less-developed-countries-ldcs.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">industrialized countries</a>. They were designed to attract foreign investment from multinational corporations. The first was in\u00a0Shannon Airport in Clare,\u00a0Ireland.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\u00a0In the 1970s, SEZs were also established in Latin American and East Asian countries.\n", "\nWhile many countries have set up SEZs, China has been the most successful in using SEZs to attract foreign capital. The first four SEZs in China were created in 1979 in the Southeastern coastal region: Shenzhen,\u00a0Zhuhai and\u00a0Shantou\u00a0in Guangdong province, and\u00a0Xiamen in Fujian province.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nChina added Hainan Island to its list of SEZs\u00a0in 1983.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff The success of the original SEZs\u00a0prompted\u00a0the government to create 14 \"open coastal cities\" in 1984. These cities enjoy similar benefits as SEZs such as the power to approve investment projects, offer incentives to foreign investors and import equipment and technology tax free.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff Within China, the SEZs essentially act as liberal\u00a0economic environments that promote\u00a0innovation and advancement. The Chinese government continues to allow these areas to offer tax incentives to foreign investors as a way of further developing the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/infrastructure.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">infrastructure</a> of these regions.\n", "\nIn the case of China, mainstream economists agree that the country's SEZs helped to liberalize the formerly traditional state. Without the SEZs, China may not have been able to successfully implement the same level of national reform.\n"]}
