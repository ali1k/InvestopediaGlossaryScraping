They can also be assured that they\u00a0won\u2019t have to re-qualify for the policy at some point in the future when their\u00a0health might not be as good and insurance might be harder to get.\n", "\nWhen applying for life or disability insurance, it is advisable to\u00a0try to obtain a policy that is both noncancellable and guaranteed renewable.\u00a0If you buy a policy that is only guaranteed renewable, the insurer must let you keep your policy as long as you pay your premiums, but your premiums could go up. The insurer is allowed to raise the premiums on a guaranteed renewable policy as long as the increase affects numerous policyholders and not just a particular customer.\n", "\nAvoid purchasing a conditionally-renewable policy, which allows the insurer to raise your premiums or cancel your coverage if it thinks the risk of insuring you has increased. These policies put you at risk of losing coverage when you need it most and at a time when you may be unable to qualify for a new policy.\n", "\nAnother benefit of a noncancellable\u00a0insurance policy that applies to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/disability-insurance-4427713\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">disability insurance</a> is that if your income decreases, your coverage will stay the same. If you got laid off from your office job and had to take up another work for lesser pay, you would still be able to keep your insurance with a noncancellable policy.\n", "\nMost\u00a0people don't have a guarantee that their income will never go down.\u00a0Under a noncancellable insurance\u00a0policy,\u00a0even if someone's\u00a0income goes down later in life\u2013if they\u00a0are totally disabled\u2013the company will pay\u00a0the total disability benefit\u00a0originally placed in-force. Under a noncancellable policy, even if someone\u00a0changes\u00a0jobs from being a white-collar, low-risk occupation to a professional race car driver, the company cannot change the insured's\u00a0benefits for the worse. Quite simply, there is no reason to buy\u00a0an individual disability insurance policy that isn't\u00a0noncancellable and guaranteed renewable.\n", "\nHowever, even a noncancellable and guaranteed renewable policy will eventually expire if it has a fixed term; many policies are designed to cover the policyholder only until age 65. By age 65, many people no longer need life or disability insurance. Because they are retired or near retirement and have saved for many years, they no longer need the financial protection that these products provide.\n"]}
