Standard criteria for evaluating a country's level of development are <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/income-per-capita.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">income per capita</a> or per capita\u00a0gross domestic product, the level of industrialization, the general <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standard-of-living.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">standard of living</a>,\u00a0and the amount of technological infrastructure.\n", "\nNoneconomic factors, such as the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/human-development-index-hdi.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">human development index</a> (HDI), which quantifies a country's levels of education, literacy, and health into a single figure, can also be used to evaluate\u00a0an economy or\u00a0the degree of development.\n", "\nThe most common metric used to determine if an economy is developed or developing is<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/per-capita-gdp.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> per capita gross domestic product</a> (GDP), although no strict level exists for an economy to be considered either developing or developed. Some economists consider\u00a0$12,000 to $15,000 per capita GDP\u00a0to be\u00a0sufficient for developed status\u00a0while others do not consider a country developed unless its per capita GDP is above $25,000 or $30,000. The U.S. per capita GDP in 2019\u00a0was $65,111.\n", "\nFor countries that are difficult to categorize, economists turn to other factors to determine development status. Standard-of-living measures, such as the infant mortality rate and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lifeexpectancy.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">life expectancy</a>, are useful although there are\u00a0no set boundaries for these measures either. However, most developed economies suffer fewer than 10 infant deaths per 1,000 live births, and their citizens live to be 75 or older on average.\n", "\nA\u00a0high per capita GDP alone does not confer developed economy status without other factors. For example, the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/united-nations-un.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">United Nations</a>\u00a0still considers Qatar, with one of the world's highest per capita GDP in 2019 at $69,688,\u00a0a developing economy because the nation has\u00a0extreme <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/income-inequality.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">income inequality</a>, a lack of infrastructure, and limited educational opportunities for non-affluent citizens.\n", "\nExamples of countries with developed economies\u00a0include the United States, Canada, and most of western Europe, including the United Kingdom and France.\n", "\nThe HDI looks at three standards of living criteria\u2014literacy rates, access to education, and access to health care\u2014and quantifies this data into a standardized figure between 0 and 1. Most developed countries have HDI figures above 0.8.\n", "\nThe United Nations, in its annual HDI rankings, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/2019-human-development-index-ranking\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reports</a>\u00a0that in\u00a02019, Norway had the world's highest HDI at 0.954. The United States ranked 15th\u00a0at 0.920. The top 10 countries in the HDI index were Norway, Switzerland, Ireland, Germany, Hong Kong (China), Australia, Iceland, Sweden, Singapore, and the Netherlands. Niger had the lowest human development index score at 0.377 out of 189 countries.\n", "\nTerms such as \"emerging countries,\" \"least-developed countries,\" and \"developing countries\" are commonly used to refer to countries that do not enjoy the same level of economic security, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/industrialization.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">industrialization</a>, and growth as developed countries.

These benefits have primarily been witnessed in the Asia-Pacific region. Though globalization has not taken root in all developing economies, it has shown to improve the economies in the ones that it has. That being said, globalization does come with drawbacks as well that need to be assessed when foreign investments flow into a developing economy.\n"]}
