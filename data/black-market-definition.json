Black market transactions usually occur \u201cunder the table\u201d to let participants avoid government <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-controls.asp\">price controls</a> or taxes. The goods and services offered in a black market can be illegal, meaning their purchase and sale are prohibited by law. Or they can be legal but transacted to avoid taxes. Black markets are also known as shadow markets or underground markets.\n", "\nTraditionally, black market activity was conducted in cash, one of its defining aspects. This was done in order to avoid creating any paper trail. With the rise of the Internet, many black market transactions are now done online, such as on the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dark-web.asp\">dark web</a>, and often conducted with <a class=\"pseudoStyle\" data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/digital-currency.asp\">digital currencies</a>.\n", "\nBecause of this nature, black markets can take a toll on an economy since they are <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shadow-market.asp\">shadow markets</a> where economic activity is not recorded and taxes are not paid. It is often assumed that a country's gross domestic product (GDP) is not its actual GDP because it does not take into account all the business activity conducted in black markets.\n", "\nThe black market's many drawbacks include the risk of fraud, the possibility of violence, and being saddled with counterfeit goods or adulterated products, which is especially dangerous in the case of medications.\n", "\nA black market is often a place for the exchange of illicit and dangerous goods. They are venues where highly controlled substances or products such as drugs and firearms are illegally traded.\n", "\nHuman trafficking is a very large black market. Human trafficking moves people into forced labor, prostitution, child armies, and the market for human organs. According to a report from the International Labor Organization (ILO) from September 2017, 24.9 million people are trapped in modern-day slavery. From a 2014 ILO report, human trafficking earns profits of $150 billion a year.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\"></span>\n", "\nOther black markets include illegal gambling, the illegal wildlife trade, and illegal mining, fishing, and logging.\n", "\nIn the financial context, the biggest black market exists for currencies in nations with strict <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currency.asp\">currency</a> controls. While most people\u00a0may shun a\u00a0black market because they consider it sleazy, there may be rare occasions when they have no choice but to turn to this necessary evil.\n", "\nAs for currency black markets, they exist primarily in nations that\u2014apart from currency controls\u2014have weak economic <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundamentals.asp\">fundamentals</a> (such as a high inflation rate and low currency reserves) and a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixedexchangerate.asp\">fixed exchange rate</a> where\u00a0the domestic currency is pegged at an unrealistically high level to the U.S. dollar or other currency. As a result, the currency black market is flourishing in nations like Argentina, Iran, and Venezuela.\n", "\nSometimes, a black market is the only choice for procuring goods in certain situations for certain people. For example, suppose\u00a0you are on vacation with your family in an exotic location and run out of formula for your baby. If there is nothing available in local stores and the only way to acquire baby formula is through a black market transaction, few people would hesitate to make the purchase.\n", "\nPaying a premium over the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/facevalue.asp\">face value</a> of a ticket to see a concert or sporting event\u00a0is also an example of a black market transaction. In\u00a0a number of developing nations, life-saving medicines are in short supply and, often, the only alternative is to procure them through the black market.\n", "\nWhile critics may carp that this only serves to perpetuate the illegal and unethical practice of profiteering from someone else\u2019s misfortune, participating in the black market is a relatively easy decision to make when someone\u2019s life is at stake.\n", "\nOne of the most recent examples of a black market using modern technology was that of the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/silk-road.asp\">Silk Road</a> black market. This was a digital market that used <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bitcoin.asp\">Bitcoin</a> for money laundering and illegal drug transactions and weapons sales.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\"></span>\n", "\nThe market began in 2011 and closed in 2013 when it was stopped by the FBI. The man behind the market was a 29-year old computer science engineer named Ross Ulbricht. Silk Road sold a variety of illegal goods and made $1 billion in sales.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\"></span>\n", "\nIt connected 4,000 drug dealers to 100,000 buyers. An individual could purchase almost anything; heroin, rocket launchers, falsified documents, and even murders for hire were discussed. It was known as the Amazon of the dark web.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\"></span><span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\"></span>\n", "\nIt led to a global search for Ulbricht. He was finally captured, the black market shut down, and he is now serving life in prison.\n", "\nA black market is any market where the exchange of goods and services takes place in order to facilitate the transaction of illegal goods or to avoid government oversight and taxes, or both.\n", "\nThere are a variety of black markets and all of them work in different ways. A black market can be a physical market where two individuals meet to exchange illegal goods, for example, a drug transaction on a street corner. A black market can also exist online, such as on the dark web, where individuals communicate to exchange goods and payments are made in digital currencies.\n", "\nAn example of a black market would be the human trafficking market that engages in the capture of people throughout the world and their sale into various areas, such as forced labor and prostitution.\n", "\nAll black markets are illegal.\n", "\nThere are various theories as to why it is called the \"black\" market. These include the association of the word black with shadows and darkness, with the markets that continued to sell slaves after abolition, and the association of the color black with anarchist groups.\n"]}
