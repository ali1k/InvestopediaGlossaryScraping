But the CDX index also functions as a shell, or container, as it\u00a0is made up of a collection of other credit derivatives: credit default swaps\u00a0(CDS).\n", "\nCurrently, the\u00a0CDX\u00a0contains 125 issuers and is broken down by two different types of\u00a0credits: <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investmentgrade.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">investment grade</a> (IG) and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/high_yield_bond.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">high yield</a> (HY). Every six months, the underlying securities of the CDX are examined and, if appropriate, replaced with new securities. This helps to ensure that the index remains current and is not cluttered with investments that\u00a0no longer exist, or which are very\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/illiquid.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">illiquid</a>.\u00a0\n", "\nThe CDX index rolls over every six months, and its 125 names enter and leave the index as appropriate. For example, if one of the names is upgraded from below investment grade to investment grade, it will move from the high-yield index to the investment-grade index when the rebalance occurs.\n", "\nThe CDX is completely standardized and exchange-traded, unlike single CDSs, which trade\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otc.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">over the counter</a> (OTC).\u00a0As such, the CDX index has a high level of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">liquidity</a> and transparency.\n", "\nCDX indexes also may\u00a0trade at\u00a0smaller <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spread.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">spreads</a>\u00a0than CDSs. Thus,\u00a0investors may hedge a portfolio of\u00a0default swaps or bonds with a CDX\u00a0more cheaply\u00a0than if they were to buy many single CDSs to achieve a similar effect.\n", "\nFinally, the CDX\u00a0is\u00a0a\u00a0well-managed tool that is subjected to intense industry scrutiny twice a year. The existence of tools such as CDX indexes makes it easier for both institutional and individual investors to\u00a0trade in complicated investment products that they otherwise might not want to own separately.\n", "\nThe CDX index came into being in the early 2000s, a complicated time in financial markets, perhaps to help make investing in complex,\u00a0high-risk (potentially high-yielding)\u00a0financial products a little less complicated and a little bit safer.\n", "\nLater, the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lcdx.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LCDX</a> was created, which is also a credit-derivative index with a basket made up of 100 single-name, loan-only CDSs. The difference is that all of the CDSs in the LCDX are\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leveragedloan.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">leveraged loans</a>.\n", "\nAlthough a bank loan is considered\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/secureddebt.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">secured debt</a>, the names that usually trade in the leveraged loan market are lower-quality credits.\u00a0Therefore, the LCDX index is used mostly by those looking for exposure to high-yield debt, but with greater risk.\n"]}
