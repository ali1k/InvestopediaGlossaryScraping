Mutual funds are investments that are made up of pooled money\u00a0from investors, which hold various securities, such as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bonds</a> and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equity.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">equities</a>. However, a unit <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trust.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">trust</a> differs from a mutual fund in that a unit trust is established under a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"5\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trustdeed.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">trust deed</a>, and the investor is effectively the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"6\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beneficiary-of-trust.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">beneficiary of the trust</a>.\n", "\nA unit trust's success depends on the expertise and experience of the company that manages it. Common types of investments undertaken by unit trusts are properties, securities, mortgages, and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashequivalents.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cash equivalents</a>. The term \u201cunit trust\u201d is also used in the United Kingdom (U.K.) as a mutual fund, which has different properties than mutual funds in the United States.\n", "\nA unit trust is a type of collective investment packaged under a trust deed. Unit trusts provide access to a vast range of securities. These are offered in Guernsey, Jersey, Fiji, Ireland, New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Namibia, Kenya, Singapore, South Africa, the U.K., the Isle of Man, and Malaysia. The exact definition of what a unit trust is in these jurisdictions varies. In Asia, for example, a unit trust is essentially the same as a mutual fund. In Canada, a unit trust is an unincorporated fund that is set up specifically to allow income to flow through to investors. However, in Canada, these investments are more commonly called <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/canadianincometrust.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">income trusts</a>.\n", "\nThe underlying value of the assets in a unit trust portfolio is directly stated by the number of units issued multiplied by the price per unit. It is also necessary to subtract transaction fees, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/managementfee.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">management fees</a>, and any other associated costs. Determining management goals and limitations depends on the goals and objectives of the investment of the unit trust.\n", "\nIn unit trust investments, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundmanager.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fund managers</a> run the trust for gains and profit. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trustee.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Trustees</a> are assigned to ensure that the fund manager runs the trust following the fund\u2019s investment goals and objectives. A trustee is a person or organization that's charged with managing assets on behalf of a third party. Trustees are often <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiduciary.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fiduciaries</a>, meaning the interests of the beneficiaries of the trust must come first and as part of that responsibility, a trustee's job to safeguard the assets of the trust.\n", "\nOwners of unit trusts are called unit-holders, and they hold the rights to the trust\u2019s assets. Between the fund manager and other important <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stakeholder.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">stakeholders</a> are registrars, who simply act as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/middleman.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">middlemen</a> or liaison for both parties.\n", "\nUnit trusts are open-ended and are divided into units with different prices. An <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/open-endfund.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">open-ended</a> fund allows for new contributions and withdrawals to and from the pool. These prices directly influence the value of the fund\u2019s total asset value. Being open-ended, whenever money is added to the trust as an investment, more units are made to match the current unit buying price. At the same time, whenever units are taken, assets are sold to match the current unit selling price.\n", "\nFund managers make money through the difference between the price of the unit when bought, which is the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/ask.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">offer price</a>, and the price of the unit when sold, which is the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bid.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bid price</a>. The difference between the offer price and the bid price is called the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bid-askspread.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bid-offer spread</a>. The bid-offer spread varies. It depends on the kind of assets managed and can range from a few <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/basispoint.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">basis points</a> on easily liquidated assets like <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"5\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/government-bond.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">government bonds</a> to a 5% or more change in assets that are more difficult to trade, such as properties.\n"]}
