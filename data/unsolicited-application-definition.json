Self-selection refers to the probability that individuals with poorer risks will seek insurance on their own instead of through an insurance professional.\n", "\nA person with a suspected or known health problem, such as heart disease, may try to submit an unsolicited application to purchase <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lifeinsurance.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">life insurance</a> before seeking medical treatment for the condition. These applicants could weigh the insured pool towards bad risks, and as such, the insurers try to screen out self-selection applicants either by requiring higher rates or by denying coverage altogether.\n", "\nThe reason for insurance carriers' extreme scrutiny of self-selecting insurance applicants goes back to a concept in\u00a0statistics called\u00a0self-selection bias. Self-selection bias\u00a0arises in any situation (not just buying insurance)\u00a0in which individuals \"select\" themselves into a\u00a0group, causing a\u00a0biased sample\u00a0and abnormal or undesirable conditions in the group. It is closely related to the\u00a0non-response bias, which describes\u00a0when a\u00a0group of people responding has different responses than the group of people not responding.\n", "\nSelf-selection makes determining the cause\u00a0more difficult, which makes determining risk levels problematic for insurance <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/actuary.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">actuaries</a>. Due to self-selection, there may be a number of differences between the people who choose to apply for insurance and those who are led into it as a course of their life and life decisions. These motivations can vary, but self-selection is typically\u00a0something a\u00a0person does after suddenly recognizing they have an urgent need for insurance.\n", "\nThere are significant differences between self-selecting\u00a0populations and those who aren't self-selecting. An outcome might be that those who elect to submit an unsolicited insurance application\u00a0have higher-than-normal risks, and this can skew risk pools and throw off the accuracy of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortality-table.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mortality tables</a>, for example. A relative measure of 'improvement' might improve the reliability of the study somewhat, but only partially.\n", "\nSelf-selection bias also causes problems in other fields where statistical averages\u00a0might not follow expected patterns. For example,\u00a0research about programs or products, in particular, are susceptible to biased\u00a0evaluations of people who have self-selected to be part of a product research project.\n"]}
