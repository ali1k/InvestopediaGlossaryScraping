Organizational charts either broadly depict an enterprise company-wide or drill down to a specific department or unit.\n", "\nOrganizational charts are alternatively referred to as \"org charts\" or \"organization charts.\"\n", "\nOrganizational charts graphically display an employee's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/professionals/102915/hierarchy-investment-bank.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hierarchical</a> status relative to other individuals within the company. For example, an assistant director will invariably fall directly below a director on the chart, indicating that the former reports to the latter. Organizational charts use simple symbols such as lines, squares, and circles to connect different job titles that relate to each other.\n", "\nOrganizational charts are constructed in three main formats.\n", "\nThis most common model situates the highest-ranking individuals atop the chart and positions lower-ranking individuals below them. For example, a public company typically shows shareholders in the highest box, followed by the following in descending vertical order:\n", "\nOther job titles that may follow c-suite execs include:\n", "\nOrganizational hierarchies generally depend on the industry, geographical location, and company size.\n", "\nAlso known as a \"horizontal\" chart, the flat org chart positions individuals on the same level, indicating more power equality and autonomous decision-making ability than is typical with employees in hierarchical corporations.\n", "\nThis more complicated organizational structure groups individuals by their common skill-sets, the departments in which they work, and the people they may report to. Matrix charts often interconnect employees and teams with more than one manager, such as a software developer who is working on two projects\u2014one with his regular team manager, and another with a separate product manager. In this scenario, the matrix chart would connect the software developer to each manager he is working with, with vertical lines.\n", "\nRegardless of a company's structure, org charts are extraordinarily useful when an entity is contemplating <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/restructuring.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">restructuring</a> its workforce or changing its management complex. Most importantly, org charts let employees transparently see how their roles fit into the overall company structure.\n"]}
