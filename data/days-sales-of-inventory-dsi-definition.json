inventory and come\u00a0at a cost. Additionally, there is a cost linked to the manufacturing of the salable product using the inventory.

DSI is calculated based on the average value of the inventory and cost of goods sold during a given period or as of a particular date. Mathematically, the number of days in the corresponding period is calculated using 365 for a year and 90 for a quarter. In some cases, 360 days is used instead.\n", "\nThe numerator figure represents the valuation of the inventory. The denominator (Cost of Sales / Number of Days) represents the average per day cost being spent by the company for manufacturing a salable product. The net factor gives the average number of days taken by the company to clear the inventory it possesses.\n", "\nTwo different versions of the DSI formula can be used depending upon the accounting practices. In the first version, the average inventory amount is taken as the figure reported at the end of the accounting period, such as at the end of the fiscal year ending June 30. This version represents DSI value \u201cas of\u201d the mentioned date.

A smaller number indicates that a company is more efficiently and frequently selling off its inventory, which means rapid turnover leading to the potential for higher profits (assuming that sales are being made in profit). On the other hand, a large DSI value indicates that the company may be struggling with obsolete, high-volume inventory and may have invested too much into the same. It is also possible that the company may be retaining high inventory levels in order to achieve high order fulfillment rates, such as in anticipation of bumper sales during an upcoming holiday season.\n", "\nDSI is a measure of the effectiveness of inventory management by a company. Inventory forms a significant chunk of the operational capital requirements for a business. By calculating the number of days that a company holds onto the inventory before it is able to sell it, this efficiency ratio measures the average length of time that a company\u2019s cash is locked up in the inventory.\n", "\nHowever, this number should be looked upon cautiously as it often lacks context. DSI tends to vary greatly among industries depending on various factors like product type and business model. Therefore, it is important to compare the value among the same sector peer companies. Companies in the technology, automobile, and furniture sectors can afford to hold on to their inventories for long, but those in the business of perishable or fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) cannot. Therefore, sector-specific comparisons should be made for DSI values.\n", "\nOne must also note that a high DSI value may be preferred at times depending on the market dynamics. If a short supply is expected for a particular product in the next quarter, a business may be better off holding on to its inventory and then selling it later for a much higher price, thus leading to improved profits in the long run.\n", "\nFor example, a drought situation in a particular soft water region\u00a0may mean that authorities will be forced to supply water from another area where water quality is hard. It may lead to a surge in demand for water purifiers after a certain period, which may benefit the companies if they hold onto inventories.\n", "\nIrrespective of the single-value figure indicated by DSI, the company management should find a mutually beneficial balance between optimal inventory levels and market demand.\n", "\nA similar ratio related to DSI is <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inventoryturnover.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">inventory turnover</a>, which\u00a0refers to the number of times a company is able to sell or use its inventory over the course of a particular time period, such as quarterly or annually.

While the DSO ratio measures how long it takes a company to receive payment on accounts receivable, the DPO value measures how long it takes a company to pay off its accounts payable. Overall, the CCC value attempts to measure the average duration of time for which each net input dollar (cash) is tied up in the production and sales process before it gets converted into cash received through sales made to customers.\n", "\nManaging inventory levels is vital for most businesses, and it is especially important for retail companies or those selling physical goods. While the inventory turnover ratio is one of the best indicators of a company\u2019s level of efficiency at turning over its inventory and generating\u00a0sales from that inventory, the days sales of inventory ratio goes a step further by putting that figure into a daily context and providing a more accurate picture of the company\u2019s inventory management and overall efficiency.\n", "\nDSI and inventory turnover ratio can help investors to know whether a company can <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/best-inventory-management-software-5088863\">effectively manage its inventory</a> when compared to competitors.

Walmart sees a lot of foot traffic in its brick and mortar retail stores, and customers buy items in bulk as their purchases are comprised of groceries, which are perishable goods. On the other hand, Amazon customers purchase items selectively (often one or two at a time), and the delivery time may add to the DSI value. As Walmart cannot afford to retain perishable items in its inventory for long, it has a relatively lower DSI value compared to Amazon, which sells a very diversified variety of goods that remain in its warehouses for a longer period.\n"]}
