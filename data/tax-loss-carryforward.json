The tax loss\u00a0carryforward can be claimed by an individual or a business to reduce any future tax payments.\u00a0\u00a0\n", "\nConsider a tax loss carryforward to be the opposite of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profit.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">profit</a>, or a negative profit, for tax purposes. A negative profit occurs when expenses are greater than revenue or capital losses are greater than capital gains. This provision is a great tool for creating future tax relief. There are two main types of loss carryforwards: <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/losscarryforward.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">net operating loss (NOL)</a> carryforwards and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital-loss-carryover.asp#citation-2\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">capital loss carryforwards</a>.\n", "\nFor income tax purposes, an NOL is the result when a company's allowable deductions exceed its taxable income within a tax period.

An NOL carryforward applies the current year's\u00a0NOL against future years' net income to reduce its over <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxliability.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tax liability</a> in the future tax period.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"11\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nFor example, if a company experiences negative\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/noi.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">net operating income (NOI)</a> in year one, but positive NOI in subsequent years, it can reduce future profits using the NOL carryforward to record some or all of the loss from the first year in the subsequent years. This results in lower taxable income in positive NOI years, reducing the amount the company owes the government in taxes. The purpose behind this tax provision is to allow some form of\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tax-relief.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tax relief</a>\u00a0when a company loses money in a tax period.
