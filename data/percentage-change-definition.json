It is used for many purposes in finance, often to represent the price change of a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp\">security</a>.\n", "\nPercentage change can be applied to any quantity that you measure over time. Let's say you are tracking the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quoted-price.asp\">quoted price</a> of a security. If the price increased, use the formula [(New Price -\u00a0Old Price)/Old Price] and then multiply that number by 100.\u00a0If the price decreased, use the formula [(Old Price - New Price)/Old Price] and multiply that number by 100.\u00a0\n", "\nThis formula is used both to track the prices of individual securities and of large market indexes, as well as comparing the values of different <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currency.asp\">currencies</a>.\u00a0Balance sheets with comparative financial statements will generally include the prices of specific assets at different points in time along with the percentage changes over the accompanying periods of time.\u00a0\n", "\nTo calculate a\u00a0percentage increase, first work out the difference (increase) between the two numbers you are comparing:\u00a0\n", "\n<em>Increase = New Number - Original Numb</em>er\n", "\nNext,\u00a0divide the increase by the original number and multiply the answer by 100:\n", "\n<em>% increase = Increase \u00f7 Original Number \u00d7 100.</em>\n", "\nIf the\u00a0answer is a negative number, that means the\u00a0percentage change is a decrease.\n", "\nFirst, work out the difference (decrease) between the two numbers you are comparing.\n", "\n<em>Decrease = Original Number - New Number</em>\n", "\nNext,\u00a0divide the decrease by the original number and multiply the answer by 100.\n", "\n<em>% Decrease = Decrease \u00f7 Original Number \u00d7 100</em>\n", "\nIf the\u00a0answer is a negative number,\u00a0this is a percentage increase.\n", "\nIf you wish to calculate the percentage increase or decrease of several numbers, it's best to use the formula for calculating percentage increase.\u00a0Positive values indicate a percentage increase whereas negative values indicate the percentage decrease.\n", "\nAs an example of calculating percentage change in a real-life scenario, consider Bob, who worked a total of 35 hours in January.\u00a0In February, he worked 45.5 hours, by what percentage did Bob\u2019s working hours increase in February?\u00a0\n", "\nTo solve this calculation, first\u00a0calculate the difference in hours between the new and old numbers.\u00a045.5 - 35 hours = 10.5 hours more hours worked by Bob\u00a0in February.\u00a0To work out the increase as a percentage, divide the increase by the original (January) number:\n", "\n<em>10.5 \u00f7 35 = 0.3</em>\n", "\nFinally, to get the percentage we multiply the answer by 100.\u00a0This simply means moving the decimal place two columns to the right.\n", "\n<em>0.3 \u00d7 100 = 30</em>\n", "\nTherefore, Bob worked 30 percent\u00a0more hours in February than he did in January.\n"]}
