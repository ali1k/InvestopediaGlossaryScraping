This act, signed into law by Barack Obama, brought sweeping new regulation and oversight to the banking industry in the wake of the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-crisis.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">financial crisis of 2008</a>.
