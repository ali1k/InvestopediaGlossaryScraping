Common examples occur within the livestock industry: cows can be utilized for milk, beef, and hide. Sheep can be utilized for meat, milk products,\u00a0wool, and sheepskin. If the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/supply.asp\">supply</a> of cows increases, so will the joint supply of dairy and beef products.\n", "\nWhere joint supply exists, the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/law-of-supply-demand.asp\">supply and demand</a> for each product is linked to the others originating from the same source. For example, if demand increases for wool, and sheep farmers therefore raise more animals for wool, there will be a related increase in the production of sheep meat. This increased production will lead to greater meat supply and potentially lower prices.\n", "\nIn some cases, the proportions of the joint products are\u00a0nearly fixed, such as with\u00a0cotton and cottonseed. In such cases,\u00a0proportions cannot be varied. In other cases, the proportion can be variable. For example, through cross-breeding,\u00a0it\u00a0is possible\u00a0to breed sheep either for wool or for meat. So the quantity of one can be increased at the expense of the other to a degree. Analysts keep a close eye on products in joint supply because <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investment.asp\">investments</a> in one can be significantly impacted by what happens with the other.\u00a0\n", "\nAnother important issue with joint supply products\u00a0is the allocation of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expense.asp\">expenses</a>. Since both products are derived from the same source, it is often difficult to figure out how to divide up expenses.\n", "\nIt is not usually feasible to simply split the expenses down the middle in the case of two products, because one product usually sells at a premium to the other. An equal split will artificially deflate or inflate profits on one product or the other. Likewise, randomly allocating expenses will produce artificial results. To handle this on the business side, there are usually pricing matrices that work backwards from the end products to establish costing for reporting purposes.\n", "\nJoint demand isn't necessarily related to joint supply. Rather, joint demand\u00a0happens\u00a0when <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/demand.asp\">demand</a> for two goods is interdependent. For example, printers need ink to function. Similarly, ink cartridges are no use without a printer. Another example could be razors\u00a0and razor blades, or gasoline and motor oil.\n", "\nBasically,\u00a0joint demand is when you need two goods because they work together to provide a benefit for the consumer.\u00a0If two goods are in joint demand, they will have a high and negative cross <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/demand-elasticity.asp\">elasticity of demand</a>. In other words, a\u00a0fall in the price of ink may prompt an increase in\u00a0demand for printers.\n"]}
