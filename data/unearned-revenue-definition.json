It can be thought of as a \"prepayment\" for goods or services that a person or company is expected to supply to the purchaser at a later date. As a result of this prepayment, the seller has a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liability.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">liability</a> equal to the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/revenue.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">revenue</a> earned until the good or service is delivered. This liability is noted under current liabilities, as it is expected to be settled within a year.\n", "\nUnearned revenue is also referred to as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deferredrevenue.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">deferred revenue</a> and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/advance-payment.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">advance payments</a>.\n", "\nUnearned revenue is most common among companies selling subscription-based products or other services that require prepayments. Classic examples include rent payments made in advance, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/prepaid-insurance.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">prepaid insurance</a>, legal retainers, airline tickets, prepayment for newspaper subscriptions, and annual prepayment for the use of software.\n", "\nReceiving money before a service is fulfilled can be beneficial.

It is treated as a liability because the revenue has still not been earned and represents products or services owed to a customer. As the prepaid service or product is gradually delivered over time, it is recognized as revenue on the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incomestatement.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">income statement</a>.\u00a0\n", "\nIf a publishing company accepts $1,200 for a one-year subscription, the amount is recorded as an increase in cash and an increase in unearned revenue.
