PMI is insurance that protects the financial institution lending the money against the risk of the borrower defaulting on a loan.\u00a0An 80-10-10 mortgage is frequently used by borrowers to avoid paying PMI, which would make a homeowner's monthly payment higher.\n", "\nIn general, 80-10-10 mortgages tend to be popular at times when home prices are accelerating. As homes become less affordable, making a 20% down payment of cash might be difficult for an individual. Piggyback mortgages allow buyers to borrow more money than their down payment might suggest.\n", "\nThe first mortgage of an 80-10-10 mortgage is usually always a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixed-rate_mortgage.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fixed-rate mortgage</a>.

As such, it only incurs interest when you use it. That means you can pay off the home equity loan or HELOC in full or in\u00a0part and eliminate interest payments on those funds. Moreover, once settled, the HELOC\u00a0credit line remains. These funds can act as an emergency pool for other expenses, such as home renovations or even education.\n", "\nAn 80-10-10 loan is a good option for people who are trying to buy a home but have not yet sold their existing home. In that scenario, they would use the HELOC to cover a portion of the down payment on the new home. They would pay off the HELOC when the old home sells.\n", "\nHELOC <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">interest rates</a> are higher than those for conventional mortgages, which will somewhat offset the savings gained by having an 80% mortgage.\u00a0If you\u00a0intend to pay off the\u00a0HELOC\u00a0within a few years, this may not be a problem.\n", "\nWhen home prices are rising, your equity will increase along with your home\u2019s value.

With a conventional 90% mortgage, they will need to pay PMI on top of the monthly mortgage payments. Also, a 90% mortgage will generally carry a higher interest rate.\u00a0\n", "\nInstead, the Doe family can take out an 80% mortgage for $240,000, possibly at a lower interest rate, and avoid the need for PMI. At the same time, they would take out a second 10% mortgage of $30,000. This\u00a0would most likely be a HELOC. The down payment will still be 10% but the family will avoid PMI costs, get a better interest rate, and thus have lower monthly payments.\n"]}
