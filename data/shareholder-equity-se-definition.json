Shareholder equity is equal to a firm's total assets minus its total liabilities.\n", "\nRetained earnings\u00a0is part of shareholder\u00a0equity and is the percentage of\u00a0net earnings\u00a0that were not paid to shareholders\u00a0as\u00a0dividends.\u00a0Retained earnings should not be confused with cash or other liquid assets. This is because years of retained earnings could be used for either expenses or any asset type to grow the business. Shareholders\u2019 equity for a company that is a going concern is not the same as liquidation value. In liquidation, physical asset values have been reduced and other extraordinary conditions exist.\n", "\nShareholder equity can be either negative or positive. If positive, the company has enough assets to cover its liabilities. If negative, the company's liabilities exceed its assets. If prolonged, this is considered balance sheet insolvency.\u00a0\n", "\nFor this reason, many investors view companies with negative shareholder equity as risky or unsafe investments. Shareholder equity alone is not a definitive indicator of a company's financial health. If used in conjunction with other tools and metrics, the investor can accurately analyze the health of an organization.\n", "\nAll the information needed to compute a company's shareholder equity is available on its balance sheet. Total assets include current and non-current assets. Current assets are assets that can be converted to cash within a year (e.g., cash, accounts receivable, inventory, et al.). Long-term assets are assets that cannot be converted to cash or consumed within a year (e.g. investments; property, plant, and equipment; and intangibles, such as patents).\n", "\nTotal liabilities consist of current and long-term liabilities. Current liabilities are debts typically due for repayment within one year (e.g. accounts payable and taxes payable). Long-term liabilities are obligations that are due for repayment in periods longer than one year (e.g., bonds payable, leases, and pension obligations). Upon calculating the total assets and liabilities, shareholder equity can be determined.\n", "\nShareholder equity is an important metric in determining the return being generated versus the total amount invested by equity investors. For example, ratios like return on equity (ROE), which is the result of a company's net income divided by shareholder equity, is used to measure how well a company's management is using its equity from investors to generate profit.\u00a0\n", "\nFor example, assume that ABC company has total assets of $2.6 million and total liabilities of $920,000.\u00a0Therefore, ABC shareholder equity is $1.68 million.\n", "\nAs a real-world example,\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=pep\">PepsiCo Inc.</a>'s (NYSE: PEP) total stockholders' equity declined in the two year period\u00a0from $17.4 billion in 2014 to $11.1 billion in 2016, which\u2014depending on the reasons\u2014might give analysts concern for the soda and snack food giant's health.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\"></span> In the same period, arch-rival\u00a0Coca-Cola Corporation's (NYSE: KO) total shareholder equity fell\u00a0from $30.3 billion to $23.01 billion.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\"></span> But the percentage drop isn't as great\u00a0because Coke's liabilities and accounts payable also consistently decreased, while Pepsi's increased, suggesting Coke had a better handle on its debt.\n", "\n<span data-value=\"\\begin{aligned} &amp;\\text{Shareholders' equity}=\\text{total assets} - \\text{total liabilities} \\end{aligned}\"><span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\">\n<math>\n<semantics>\n<mtable>\n<mtr>\n<mtd>\n<mstyle>\n<mrow></mrow>\n</mstyle>\n</mtd>\n<mtd>\n<mstyle>\n<mrow>\n<mrow></mrow>\n<mtext>\nShareholders\u2019\u00a0equity\n</mtext>\n<mo>\n=\n</mo>\n<mtext>\ntotal\u00a0assets\n</mtext>\n<mo>\n\u2212\n</mo>\n<mtext>\ntotal\u00a0liabilities\n</mtext>\n</mrow>\n</mstyle>\n</mtd>\n</mtr>\n</mtable>\n<annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\n\\begin{aligned} &amp;\\text{Shareholders' equity}=\\text{total assets} - \\text{total liabilities} \\end{aligned}\n</annotation>\n</semantics>\n</math></span><span class=\"katex-html\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mtable\"><span class=\"col-align-r\"><span class=\"vlist-t vlist-t2\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\"><span class=\"\"><span class=\"pstrut\"></span><span class=\"mord\"></span></span></span><span class=\"vlist-s\">\u200b</span></span><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\"><span class=\"\"></span></span></span></span></span><span class=\"col-align-l\"><span class=\"vlist-t vlist-t2\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\"><span class=\"\"><span class=\"pstrut\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord\"></span><span class=\"mord text\"><span class=\"mord\">Shareholders\u2019\u00a0equity</span></span><span class=\"mspace\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">=</span><span class=\"mspace\"></span><span class=\"mord text\"><span class=\"mord\">total\u00a0assets</span></span><span class=\"mspace\"></span><span class=\"mbin\">\u2212</span><span class=\"mspace\"></span><span class=\"mord text\"><span class=\"mord\">total\u00a0liabilities</span></span></span></span></span><span class=\"vlist-s\">\u200b</span></span><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\"><span class=\"\"></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>\n", "\nThe formula above is also known as the accounting equation or balance sheet equation.

This equation is known as a balance sheet equation as all the relevant information can be gleaned from the balance sheet. Take the equity at the onset of the accounting period, add or subtract any equity infusions (such as adding cash from shares issued or subtracting cash used for treasury purchases), add net income, subtract all cash dividends paid out and any net losses, and what you have left is the shareholder equity for that period.\n"]}
