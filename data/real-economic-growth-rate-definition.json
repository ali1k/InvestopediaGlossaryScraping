In other words, it reveals changes in the value of all goods and services produced by an economy\u2014the\u00a0economic output of a country\u2014while accounting for price fluctuations.\n", "\nThe real economic growth rate is expressed as a percentage that shows the rate of change\u00a0in\u00a0a country's GDP, typically from one year to the next. Another\u00a0economic growth measure is the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gnp.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">gross national product</a> (GNP), which is sometimes preferred if a nation's economy is substantially dependent on foreign earnings.\n", "\nThe real GDP growth rate is a more useful measure than the nominal GDP growth rate because it considers\u00a0the effect\u00a0of\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">inflation</a> on economic data. The real economic growth rate is a \"constant dollar\" figure, avoiding the distortion from periods of extreme inflation or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deflation.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">deflation</a> to give a more consistent measure.\n", "\nGDP is the sum of consumer spending, business spending, government spending, and total <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/export.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">exports</a>, minus total <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/import.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">imports</a>. The calculation for factoring in inflation to arrive at the real GDP figure is as follows:\n", "\nReal GDP = GDP / (1 + inflation since base year)\n", "\nThe <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/base-year-analysis.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">base year</a> is a designated year, updated periodically by the government and used as a comparison point for economic data such as the GDP. The calculation for the real GDP growth rate is based on real GDP, as follows:\n", "\nReal GDP growth rate = (most recent year's real GDP - the last year's real GDP) / the previous year's real GDP\n", "\nA\u00a0country's real economic growth rate is helpful to government policymakers when making <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiscalpolicy.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fiscal policy</a> decisions.

In an expanding economy, the GDP growth rate will be positive because businesses are growing and creating jobs for greater productivity.\n", "\nHowever, if the growth rate exceeds 3% or 4%, economic growth may stall. A period of contraction will follow when businesses hold off on investing and hiring, as this will result in consumers having less money to spend.
