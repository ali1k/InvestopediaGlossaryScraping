The Additional Child Tax Credit was a refundable tax credit that families could qualify for if they already qualified\u00a0for the non-refundable Child Tax Credit. The Additional Child Tax Credit was ideal for families who owed less than the Child Tax Credit and wanted to receive\u00a0a refund for the surplus credit.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"5\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nWhile the Additional Child Tax Credit was eliminated in 2018 under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), up to $1,400 of the $2,000 Child Tax Credit can be refundable for each qualifying child if certain conditions are met. For example, in order to qualify for any refund, a taxpayer needs to earn more than $2,500 for the tax year. To make a claim for a refund, filers must complete Schedule 8812.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"11\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nPrior to the TCJA, the IRS allowed families with an annual income of more than $3,000 to claim a refund using the Additional Child Tax Credit. The tax credit depended\u00a0on how much the taxpayer earned\u00a0and was calculated by taking 15% of the taxpayer's taxable <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earnedincome.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">earned income</a> over $3,000 up to the maximum amount of the credit, which was then $1,000 per child.

Their earned income is $28,000, which means income over $3,000 is $25,000. Since 15% x $25,000 = $3,750 is greater than the maximum credit of $2,000 for two kids, they would have received the full portion of any unused credit. So, if the taxpayer received a $800 Child Tax Credit, they would be refunded a $1,200 Additional Child Tax Credit. However, if the taxable earned income was $12,000 instead, 15% of this amount over $3,000 is 15% x $9,000 = $1,350. Because the refundable portion of the credit cannot exceed 15% of earned income that is above $3,000, the taxpayer would receive a maximum refund of $1,350, not $2,000.\n", "\nTaxpayers with income below $3,000 were eligible if they had at least three qualifying dependents and paid <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/social-security-tax.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Social Security Tax</a> in excess of the amount of their <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earnedincomecredit.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">earned-income credit</a> for the year.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"12\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n"]}
