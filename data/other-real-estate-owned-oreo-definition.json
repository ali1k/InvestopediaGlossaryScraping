Oftentimes, these assets are acquired due to foreclosure proceedings. A large quantity of OREO assets on a bank balance sheet may raise concerns about the overall health of the institution.\n", "\nWhen a real estate property is deemed \"<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/realestateowned.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">real estate owned</a>,\" it means that the property is now\u00a0owned by a lender because the borrower <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/default2.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">defaulted</a> on their mortgage, and the property did not sell at foreclosure auction. Banks are not typically in the business of owning real estate, and end up in that position when something goes wrong with their borrower (usually <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreclosure.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">foreclosure</a>). A former premise of a bank that has not yet sold would be another example of a bank's OREO assets, since the property is no longer income-producing. Since the real estate is not being held as an income-producing asset, it is treated differently in the bank's accounting records and reporting. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/office-comptroller-currency-occ.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)</a> regulates banks' holdings of OREO assets.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nMost OREO assets are available for sale by the banks who own them. Many states have laws that regulate the acquisition and maintenance of OREO properties. Banks are generally required to maintain, keep insurance on, pay taxes on, and actively market them.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nIncreasing OREO on a bank\u2019s balance sheet may indicate that the institution\u2019s credit is deteriorating while its non-earning assets are growing. Since real estate is not a liquid asset, high levels of OREO can harm a bank's liquidity.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n"]}
