It is the combination of both these taxes that creates the uniform transfer tax.\n", "\nThe uniform transfer tax is a kind of transfer tax, which means it is a kind of tax levied on the transfer of ownership or title to property from one entity to another. The Internal Revenue Service oversees the regulations of the uniform transfer tax. Transfer taxes are usually nondeductible on one's tax returns.\n", "\nThe uniform transfer tax combines elements of the federal gift tax and the federal estate tax. The federal gift tax applies to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/transfer.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">transfers</a> made while a person is living and is 40 percent of any amount gifted over $15,000 in a given year. It\u00a0applies to the giver of the gift, not the individual receiving it.

The tax law that oversees gift taxes is notoriously complicated but was raised to $15,000 in 2018. It has remained at this amount.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nThe other half of the uniform transfer tax is the estate tax, which is a tax <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/levy.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">levied</a> on an heir's inherited portion of an estate. This estate tax only applies if the value of the estate exceeds the exclusion limit set by law. That act is referred to as an unlimited marital deduction.\n", "\nFor 2020, the IRS requires estates exceeding $11.58 million to file a federal estate tax return and pay estate taxes. The exclusion amount rises to $11.7 million in 2021. This means that an estate of $11 million does not need to file an estate tax return. These exclusion amounts are significantly higher from previous years. In 2017, for example, taxes were owed if the estate exceeded $5.49 million.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nSince the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/probate.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">probate</a>\u00a0process can be expensive, some people would rather use the unified transfer tax to save on estate taxes after their deaths.
