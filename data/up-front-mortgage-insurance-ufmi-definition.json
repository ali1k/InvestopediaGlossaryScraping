Though similar, it is not quite the same as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/insurance/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">private mortgage insurance</a> (PMI), which is collected by a conventional private mortgage lender each month when a buyer's down payment on a home is less than 20% of the purchase price. Up-front mortgage premiums are added to a pool of money that is used to help entities, such as the FHA, insure loans for certain borrowers.\n", "\nLike PMI, the purpose of FHA mortgage insurance is to protect the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lender.asp#axzz1d25MRRfK\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lender</a>. When borrowers have minimal <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equity.asp#axzz1d25MRRfK\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">equity</a> in their homes, the risk (to the lender) that the borrower will default is higher, because the borrower doesn't have as much to lose by walking away and letting the bank foreclose. With mortgage insurance, if you stop making your mortgage payments and walk away from your home, the insurer will help your lender recoup its losses.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fhaloan.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FHA loans</a> have lower down-payment requirements\u2014as low as 3.5% of a home's price tag\u2014 and less stringent income and credit requirements than conventional loans.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff So these loans require the payment of up-front mortgage insurance, which is collected at the time of closing.\n", "\nSince 2015, the rate for up-front mortgage insurance has been 1.75% of the base loan price. FHA Streamline refinance loans are charged a UFMIP of 0.55%.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff You have the option to pay this amount in cash when you close your loan, but most people choose to roll it into their total mortgage amount.\n", "\nIn addition to the UFMI, borrowers have to pay ongoing <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/insurance/qualified-insurance-premium/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mortgage insurance premiums (MIP)</a>, which range from 0.45% to 1.05% of the total mortgage.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff You'll have to pay this mortgage insurance until your <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/loantovalue.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">loan-to-value ratio</a> is high enough\u2014that is, until you have paid off a certain amount of your mortgage. When your equity is high enough (in the case of an FHA loan, the percentage is 22%<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff ), there is less risk for the lender should you walk away from the loan. At this time, the insurance is no longer required. Those with loans greater than 15 years are required to make monthly mortgage insurance payments for five years. If your mortgage is shorter than 15 years, then the only requirement is the 78% loan-to-value ratio.\n", "\nUp-front mortgage insurance premium payments are submitted directly to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and collected by the U.S. Department of the Treasury's automated collection service. They go into an escrow account.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"6\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nHUD uses a secure Internet collection\u00a0portal to process collections electronically.

In other words, they may be entitled to a substantial refund even years after the fact.\n", "\nIf a homeowner\u00a0received their\u00a0FHA loan before June 2013, they\u00a0are eligible for\u00a0a refund and\u00a0cancelation of their up-front mortgage insurance premium after five years. A homeowner\u00a0must have 22% equity in the property, and\u00a0all payments must have been made on time.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff Homeowners with FHA loans issued after June 2013\u00a0must refinance into a conventional loan and have a current loan-to-value of at 80% or more.\n", "\nThere are a few ways home buyers can avoid paying upfront mortgage insurance:\n"]}
