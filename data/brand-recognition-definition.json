Brand recognition is a concept used in advertising and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketing.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">marketing</a>. It is considered successful when people are able to recognize a brand through visual or auditory cues such as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/logo.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">logos</a>, slogans, packaging, colors, or jingles rather than being explicitly exposed to a company's name. Companies often conduct <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market-research.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">market research</a> to determine the success of their brand recognition strategies.\n", "\nA brand is a name, logo, word, mark, tagline, or any other identifying characteristic that separates a company's product or service from others on the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">market</a>. A brand is among the most important <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">assets</a> that a company has because it represents the company and helps keep the company in consumers' minds. Brands are normally protected using <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trademark.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">trademarks</a>.\n", "\nCompanies invest a lot of time and money to create brand recognition. In order for brand recognition to work, companies need to find a way to help consumers recall their brand. A company's marketing department often comes up with different cues\u2014both audio and visual cues\u2014to help set their brand apart in the marketplace. They can do this by using logos, colors, marks, or jingles. Logos like the Nike (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=NKE\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NKE</a>) swoosh and the Golden Arches from McDonald's (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=MCD\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MCD</a>), and taglines like \"They're magically delicious\" from Lucky Charms cereal and \"I'm a big kid now\" from Huggies diapers all help further brand recognition.\n", "\nTo measure brand recognition and the effectiveness of promotional and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketing-campaign.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">marketing campaigns</a>, many companies perform market research through experiments on focus or study groups. Both aided and unaided recall tests may be used in these groups. With <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/product-family.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">similar products</a>, brand recognition often results in higher sales, even if both brands are of equal quality.\n", "\nBrand recognition is often paired with brand recall, which is why it's also known as aided brand recall. Aided brand recall is the ability of customers to think of a brand name from their memory when told to think of a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/product-family.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">category of products</a>. Brand recall tends to indicate a stronger connection to a brand than brand recognition. For example, people tend to think of more brand names when prompted by a product than by a category. Brand recall is also called unaided recall or spontaneous recall.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/small-business-4427743\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Small businesses</a> and big <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corporation.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">corporations</a> can do much to build and maintain their brand recognition. This ensures they remain top of mind with customers who are ready to buy their products or services. Here are a few ways they can do this:\n", "\nBrand recognition shouldn't be confused with <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brandawareness.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">brand awareness</a>. Although they may seem similar, they're not. But they are related. Remember, brand recognition is the visual and audio cues people use to identify a brand. Brand awareness, on the other hand, is the knowledge that a brand exists. This is the extent to which the general public knows that a company, along with its products and services are available on the market. Brand awareness is what leads to brand recognition. For instance, if people didn't know about the Apple (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=AAPL\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AAPL</a>) brand, they probably wouldn't recognize and associate the famous Apple logo with its products.\n"]}
