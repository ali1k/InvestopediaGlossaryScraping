A value trap\u00a0can attract investors who are looking for a bargain because they seem inexpensive relative to historical valuation multiples of the stock or relative to those of industry peers or the prevailing market multiple.\u00a0The danger of a value trap presents itself when the stock continues to languish or drop further after an investor buys into the company.\n", "\nGenerally, a company that has been trading at low <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/multiplesapproach.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">multiples</a> of\u00a0earnings,\u00a0cash flow,\u00a0or\u00a0book value for an extended period of time has little promise, and possibly no future\u2014even if the price of their stock appears attractive.
