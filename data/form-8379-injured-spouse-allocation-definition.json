These obligations might include past-due federal tax, state tax, child support, or federal non-tax debt (such as a student loan). The term \"injured\" refers to the negatively impacted spouse, who does not owe the debt.\n", "\nTypically, spouses are jointly responsible for a tax obligation so an injured spouse should file Form 8379 when they become aware that all or part of a share of a refund was, or is expected to be, applied against their spouse's legally enforceable past-due obligations.\n", "\nIf a spouse has fallen behind on <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/tax/10/spousal-support-taxation.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">child support</a> payments, alimony, federal or state taxes, federal non-tax debt such as student loans, or certain unemployment compensation debt, then the Department of Treasury is authorized to take a taxpayer's refund and apply it toward the past-due debt.
