The policyholder can use the cash value for many purposes, such as a source of loans or cash or to pay policy premiums.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nCash value insurance is permanent life insurance because it provides coverage for the policyholder\u2019s life. Traditionally, cash value life insurance has higher premiums than <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/termlife.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">term life insurance</a> because of the cash value element.\u00a0Most cash value life insurance policies require a fixed-level premium payment, of which a portion is allocated to the cost of insurance and the remaining deposited into a cash value account.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nThe cash value of life insurance earns a modest rate of interest, with taxes deferred on the accumulated earnings. Thus, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/082114/how-cash-value-builds-life-insurance-policy.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the cash value of life insurance will increase over time</a>. As the life insurance cash value increases, the insurance company\u2019s risk decreases, because the accumulated cash value offsets part of the insurer\u2019s liability.\n", "\nConsider a policy with a $25,000 death benefit. The policy has no outstanding loans or prior cash withdrawals\u00a0and an accumulated cash value of $5,000.\u00a0Upon the death of the policyholder, the insurance company pays the full death benefit of $25,000.\u00a0Money collected into the cash value is now the property of the insurer. Because the cash value is $5,000, the real liability cost to the insurance company is $20,000 ($25,000 \u2013 $5,000).\n", "\nThe cash value component <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/082114/6-ways-capture-cash-value-life-insurance.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">serves as a living benefit for policyholders</a> from which they may draw funds. The life insurance net cash value is what the policyholder or their beneficiary has left over once the insurance company deducts its fees or any expenses incurred during the ownership of the policy. There are several options for accessing funds. For most policies, partial <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashsurrendervalue.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">surrenders</a> or withdrawals are permissible but these can reduce the death benefit.\n", "\nTaxes are deferred on earnings until withdrawn from the policy and distributed. Once distributed, earnings are taxable at the policyholder\u2019s standard tax rate.\u00a0Some policies allow for unlimited withdrawals, while others restrict how many draws can\u00a0be taken\u00a0during a term or calendar year.\u00a0Some\u00a0policies\u00a0limit the amounts available for removal (e.g., minimum $500).\n", "\nMost cash value life insurance arrangements allow for loans from the cash value. Much as with any other loan, the issuer will charge interest on the outstanding principal. The outstanding loan amount will reduce the death benefit dollar for dollar in the event of the death of the policyholder before the full repayment of the loan. Some insurers require the repayment of loan interest, and, if unpaid, they may deduct the interest from the remaining cash value.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nCash value may also be used to pay policy premiums. If there is a sufficient amount, a policyholder can stop paying premiums out of pocket and have the cash value account cover the payment.\n"]}
