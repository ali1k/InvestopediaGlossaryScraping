The <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gips.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Global Investment Performance Standards</a> dictate that returns of portfolios or composites for periods of less than one year may not be annualized.

This scaling process allows investors to objectively compare the returns of any assets over any period.\n", "\nCalculating the annualized performance of an investment or index using yearly data uses\u00a0the following data points:\n", "\nP = principal, or initial investment\n", "\nG = gains or losses\n", "\nn = number of years\n", "\nAP = annualized performance rate\n", "\nThe generalized formula, which is exponential to take into account <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/compoundinterest.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">compound interest</a> over time, is:\n", "\nAP = ((P + G) / P) ^ (1 / n) - 1\n", "\nFor example, assume an investor invested $50,000 into a mutual fund\u00a0and, four years later, the investment is worth $75,000. This is a $25,000 gain in four years. Thus, the annualized performance is:\n", "\nAP = (($50,000 + $25,000) / $50,000) ^ (1/4) - 1\n", "\nIn this example, the annualized performance is\u00a010.67 percent.\n", "\nA $25,000 gain on a $50,000 investment over four years is a 50 percent return. It is inaccurate to say the annualized return is 12.5 percent, or 50 percent divided by four\u00a0because this does not take into effect compound interest. If reversing the 10.67 percent result to compound over four years, the result is exactly what is expected:\n", "\n$75,000 = $50,000 x (1 + 10.67%) ^ 4\n", "\nIt is important not to confuse annualized performance with annual performance. The annualized performance is the rate at which an investment grows each year over the period to arrive\u00a0at the final valuation. In this example, a 10.67 percent return each year for four years grows\u00a0$50,000 to $75,000. But this says nothing about the actual annual returns over the four-year period. Returns of 4.5 percent, 13.1 percent, 18.95\u00a0percent and 6.7\u00a0percent grow\u00a0$50,000 into approximately $75,000. Also, returns of 15 percent, -7.5 percent, 28\u00a0percent, and 10.2\u00a0percent provide the same result.\n", "\nIndustry standards for most investments dictate the most precise form of annualized return calculation, which uses days instead of years. The formula is the same, except for the exponent:\n", "\nAP = ((P + G) / P) ^ (365 / n) - 1\n", "\nAssume from the previous example that the fund returned $25,000 over a 1,275-day period. The annualized return is then:\n", "\nAP = (($50,000 + $25,000) / $50,000) ^ (365/1275) - 1\n", "\nThe annualized performance in this example is 12.31 percent.\n"]}
