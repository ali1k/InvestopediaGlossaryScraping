He is best known for his theories on <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/businesscycle.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">business cycles</a><strong> </strong>and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalism.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">capitalist</a> development<strong> </strong>and for introducing the concept of entrepreneurship.\n", "\nSchumpeter was born in what is now the Czech Republic in 1883, learning economics from the progenitors of the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/09/austrian-school-of-economics.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Austrian school tradition</a>, including Friedrich von Wieser and Eugen von Bohm-Bawerk. Schumpeter served as minister of finance in the Austrian government, the president of a private bank, and a professor, before being forced to leave his home country, due to the rise of the Nazis.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nIn 1932, he moved to the United States to teach at Harvard. Fifteen years later, in 1947, he became the first immigrant to be elected president of the American Economic Association.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nBy the early 20th century, economic science in the United States and Great Britain had developed along static and mathematically oriented <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/general-equilibrium-theory.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">general equilibrium</a> models. Schumpeter\u2019s work differed at times, typifying the continental European more nuanced and less hypothetical approach, although some of his theories were drawn from <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/walras-law.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Walrasian</a> general equilibrium as well.\n", "\nOver his many years in public life, Schumpeter developed informal rivalries with the other great thinkers of the west, including <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/john_maynard_keynes.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">John Maynard Keynes</a>, Irving Fisher, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/ludwig-von-mises.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ludwig von Mises</a>, and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/friedrich-hayek.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Friedrich Hayek</a>. His work initially was overshadowed by some of his contemporaries.\n", "\nSchumpeter is best known for his 1942 book <em>Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy</em> as well as the theory of dynamic\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economicgrowth.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">economic growth</a> known as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creativedestruction.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">creative destruction</a>.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff He is also credited with the first German and English references to methodological individualism in economics.\n", "\nSchumpeter made many contributions to economic science and political theory, but by far his most enduring legacy came from a six-page chapter in <em>Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy</em> entitled \u201cThe Process of Creative Destruction.\u201d<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nThe economist coined the term creative destruction to describe how the old is being constantly replaced by the new. Schumpeter offered a new, unique insight into how economies\u00a0grow, explaining that economic progress is not gradual and peaceful but rather disjointed and sometimes unpleasant.\n", "\n\u00a0\u201cThe same process of industrial mutation\u2014if I may use that biological term\u2014that incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within, incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one. This process of creative destruction is the essential fact about capitalism,\u201d he said.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nSchumpeter is believed to be the first scholar to introduce the world to the concept of entrepreneurship. He came up with the German word\u00a0<em>Unternehmergeist,</em>\u00a0meaning entrepreneur-spirit, adding that these individuals controlled the economy because they are responsible for delivering innovation and technological change.\n", "\nSchumpeter\u2019s arguments sharply deviated from the dominant tradition. He highlighted the fact that markets do not passively tend toward <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equilibrium.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">equilibrium</a> until\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profitmargin.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">profit margins</a>\u00a0are wiped out. Instead, entrepreneurial innovation and experimentation constantly destroy the old and introduce new equilibria, making possible higher\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standard-of-living.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">standards of living</a>.\n", "\nIn many respects, Schumpeter saw\u00a0capitalism\u00a0as a method of evolution within the social and economic hierarchy. The entrepreneur becomes the revolutionary, upsetting the established order to create dynamic change.\n", "\nThese theories tie in with Schumpeter\u2019s belief in the presence of business cycles. Whenever an\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/entrepreneur.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">entrepreneur</a>\u00a0disrupts an existing industry, it is likely that existing workers, businesses or even entire sectors can be temporarily thrown into loss, he said. These cycles are tolerated, he explained, because it allows resources to be freed up for other, more productive uses.\n", "\n\"Barring very few cases in which difficulties arise, it is possible to count off, historically as well as statistically, six Juglars [8-10-year business cycles] to a Kondratieff [50-60 years] and three Kitchins [40 months] to a Juglar\u2014not as an average but in every individual case,\u201d wrote Schumpeter in his book <em>The Theory of Economic Development</em>, published in 1911.\n", "\nSchumpeter was born just a few months before Keynes and, like his contemporary, is considered to be one of the best economists of the 20th century. The pair had radically different views.\n", "\nKeynes viewed the economy as healthy when in static equilibrium. Schumpeter rejected this theory, claiming that equilibrium is not healthy and that innovation is the driver of the economy. Both had contrasting views on government intervention, too. Keynes believed that a permanent equilibrium of prosperity could be achieved by central bank <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monetarypolicy.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">monetary policies</a>. Schumpeter argued that government intervention increased <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">inflation</a>, destroying the economy.\n", "\nIn his early career, Schumpeter derided the use of statistical aggregates in economic theory, likely a shot at Keynes, in favor of focusing on individual choice and action.\n", "\nSchumpeter\u2019s work initially received little acclaim, due in part to the popularity of Keynes. That changed over time and he is now viewed as one of the world\u2019s greatest economists.\n"]}
