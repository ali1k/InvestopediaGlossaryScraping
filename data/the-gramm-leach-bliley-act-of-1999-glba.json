The <em>GLBA</em> was an attempt to update and modernize the financial industry. The <em>GLBA</em>\u00a0is most well-known as the\u00a0repeal of the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/glass_steagall_act.asp\"><em>Glass-Steagall Act</em></a> of 1933, which stated that <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commercialbank.asp\">commercial banks</a> were not allowed to offer financial services\u2014like investments and insurance-related services\u2014as part of normal operations.\n", "\nDue to the remarkable losses incurred as a result of 1929's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blacktuesday.asp\">Black Tuesday</a> and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blackthursday.asp\">Thursday</a>, the <em>Glass-Steagall Act</em> was originally created to protect bank depositors from additional exposure to risk, associated with stock market volatility. As a result, for many years, commercial banks were not legally allowed to act as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/broker-awards-4587871\">brokers</a>. Since many regulations have been instituted since the 1930s to protect bank depositors, GLBA was created to allow these financial industry participants to offer more services.\n", "\nGLBA was passed on the heels of commercial bank Citicorp\u2019s merger with the insurance firm Travelers Group. This led to the formation of the conglomerate <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/031815/how-citigroup-makes-its-money.asp\">Citigroup</a>, which offered not only commercial banking and insurance services, but also lines of business related to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp\">securities</a>. Its brands at this stage included Citibank, Smith Barney, Primerica, and Travelers. Citicorp\u2019s merger was a violation of the then-existing Glass\u2013Steagall Act,\u00a0as well as the <em>Bank Holding Company Act</em> of 1956.\n", "\nTo allow the merger to take place, the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalreservebank.asp\">U.S. Federal Reserve</a> gave Citigroup a temporary waiver in September 1998\u2014a precursor to Congress\u2019s passage of <em>GLBA.</em> Moving forward, other similar mergers would be fully legal. Repealing Glass\u2013Steagall also removed the ban of \u201csimultaneous service by any officer, director, or employee of a securities firm as an officer, director, or employee of any member bank.\u201d\n", "\nThe <em>Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act</em> also required financial institutions offering consumers loan services, financial or investment advice, and/or insurance,\u00a0to fully explain their information-sharing practices to their customers. Firms must allow their customers the option to \"opt-out\" if they do not want their sensitive information shared.\n", "\nWhile many consider critical information, such as bank balances and account numbers, to be confidential, in reality, this data is consistently bought and sold by banks, credit card companies, and others. Gramm-Leach-Bliley required\u00a0limited privacy protections against such personal data sales,\u00a0along with pretexting (obtaining personal information through false pretenses).\n"]}
