Rollover IRAs are commonly used to hold 401(k), <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/roll-into-403b.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">403(b)</a> or profit-sharing plan assets that are transferred from a former employer's sponsored retirement account or qualified plan.

Most rollovers occur when people change jobs and wish to move 401(k) or 403(b) assets into an IRA, but some occur when account holders want to switch to an IRA with better benefits or investment choices.\n", "\nTo engineer a direct rollover, an account holder needs to ask his plan administrator to draft a check and send it directly to the IRA. In IRA-to-IRA transfers, the trustee from one plan sends the rollover amount to the trustee from the other plan.\n", "\nIf an account holder receives a check from his existing IRA or retirement account, they can cash it and deposit the funds into the new\u00a0IRA. However, they must complete the process within 60 days\u00a0to avoid income taxes on the withdrawal. If they miss the 60-day deadline, the Internal Revenue Service treats the amount like an early distribution.\n", "\nAn <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indirect-rollover.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">indirect rollover</a> allows for the transferring of assets from a tax-deferred\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/401kplan.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">401(k) plan</a>\u00a0to a traditional\u00a0IRA.\u00a0With this method, the funds are given to the employee via check to be deposited into their own personal account. With an indirect rollover, it is up to the employee to redeposit the funds into the new IRA within the allotted 60 day period to avoid penalty.\n", "\nIn direct transfers, the IRS withholds no taxes. Rather, the entire amount transfers directly from one account to another. However, if the account holder receives a check he or she\u00a0deposits into the IRA, the IRS insists upon a withholding penalty. Custodians or trustees must withhold 10 percent\u00a0on checks from IRA distributions and 20% on distributions from other retirement accounts, whether or not the funds are for a rollover. At tax time, this amount appears as tax paid by the tax filer.\n", "\nHowever, if an account holder receives a distribution from a Roth IRA to roll over into a traditional IRA, they do not have to pay any taxes on the distribution or report it as income\u00a0as the IRS does not tax\u00a0distributions from Roth IRAs.\n", "\nMany IRAs allow only one rollover per year on an IRA-to-IRA transfer. The one-year calendar runs from the time the account holder made the distribution, and it does not apply to rollovers between traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs. Individuals who do not follow this rule may have to report extra IRA-to-IRA transfers as gross income in the tax year the rollover occurs.
