The requisition process is a standardized way of keeping track of and accounting for all requisitions made within a business.\n", "\nA requisition initiates the request for a specific\u00a0action and also records that action for subsequent reporting needs. For example,\u00a0employees\u00a0within a company would use a purchase requisition if they needed additional supplies.
