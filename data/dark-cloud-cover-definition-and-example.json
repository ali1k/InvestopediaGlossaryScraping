The pattern is created by an up candle followed by a down candle. Traders look for the price to continue lower on the next (third) candle. This is called <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/confirmation.asp\">confirmation</a>.\n", "\nThe Dark Cloud Cover pattern involves a\u00a0large black candle\u00a0forming a \"dark cloud\" over the preceding up candle. As with a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearishengulfingp.asp\">bearish engulfing</a> pattern, buyers push the price higher at the open, but sellers take over later in the session and push the price sharply lower. This shift from buying to selling indicates that a price reversal to the downside could be forthcoming.\n", "\nMost traders consider the Dark Cloud Cover pattern useful only if it occurs following an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/uptrend.asp\">uptrend</a> or an overall rise in price. As prices rise, the pattern becomes more important for marking a potential move to the downside. If the price action is <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/choppymarket.asp\">choppy</a> the pattern is less significant since the price is likely to remain choppy after the pattern.\n", "\nThe five criteria for the Dark Cloud Cover pattern are:\n", "\nThe Dark Cloud Cover pattern is further characterized by white and black candlesticks that have long <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/realbody.asp\">real bodies</a>\u00a0and relatively short or non-existent <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shadow.asp\">shadows</a>. These attributes suggest that the move lower was both highly decisive and significant in terms of price movement. Traders might also look for a confirmation in the form of a bearish candle following the pattern. The price is expected to decline following the Dark Cloud Cover, so if it doesn't that indicates the pattern may <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/failedbreak.asp\">fail</a>.\n", "\nThe close of the bearish candle may be used to exit <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long.asp\">long</a> positions. Alternatively, traders may exit the following day if the price continues to decline (pattern confirmed). If entering <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/short.asp\">short</a> on the close of the bearish candle, or the next period, a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stop-lossorder.asp\">stop loss</a> can be placed above the high of the bearish candle.

Traders utilize other methods or candlestick patterns for determining when to exit a short trade based on Dark Cloud Cover.\n", "\nTraders may use the Dark Cloud Cover pattern in conjunction with other forms of technical analysis. For example, traders might look for a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rsi.asp\">relative strength index (RSI)</a> greater than 70, which provides a confirmation that the security is overbought.

That session provided confirmation.\n", "\nTraders who were long could consider exiting near the close of the bearish candle or on the following day (confirmation day) when the price continued dropping. Traders could also enter short positions at these junctures as well.\n", "\nIf entering short, the initial stop loss could be placed above the high of the bearish candle. Following the confirmation day, the stop loss could be dropped to just above the confirmation day high in this case.
