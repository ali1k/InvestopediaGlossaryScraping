Oil output declined by only 7% or less, but the short-term supply disruption led to a spike in prices, panic buying, and long lines at gas stations.\u00a0\n", "\nThe 1979 energy crisis occurred in the aftermath of the Iranian Revolution, which started in early 1978 and ended in early 1979 with the fall of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the state\u2019s monarch. Turmoil in Iran, a major petroleum <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/export.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">exporting</a> country, caused the global <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/supply.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">supply</a> of crude oil to decline significantly, triggering noteworthy shortages, and a surge in panic buying\u2014within 12 months, the price per barrel of this widely used resource almost doubled to $39.50.\n", "\nShort-run disruptions in the global supply of gasoline and diesel fuel were particularly acute in the spring and early summer of 1979. Several states responded by <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rationing.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">rationing</a> gasoline, including California, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, and New Jersey. In these populous states, consumers could only\u00a0purchase gas every other day, based on whether the last digit of their license plate numbers was\u00a0even or odd.\u00a0\n", "\nThe gasoline shortage also led to fears that <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commoditiesexchange.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">heating oil</a> might be in short supply through the 1979-1980 winter. This prospect was especially concerning for New England states, where demand for home heating oil was the highest.\n", "\nIt would be erroneous to blame the crisis solely on the fall of the Shah. Notably, the U.S. faced more-acute pain from the crisis than other developed countries in Europe, which also depended on oil from Iran and other Middle East countries. Part of the reason behind the crisis had to do with <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiscalpolicy.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fiscal policy</a> decisions in the U.S.\n", "\nIn early 1979, the U.S. government <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/regulated-market.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">regulated</a> oil prices.\u00a0Regulators ordered refiners to restrict the supply of gasoline in the early days of the crisis to build <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inventory.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">inventories</a>, directly contributing to higher prices at the pump.\n", "\nAnother factor was unintended supply restriction after the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/insights/what-does-secretary-energy-do/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Department of Energy</a>\u00a0(DOE) decided to make a handful of large U.S. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/oil-refinery.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">refiners</a> sell crude to smaller refiners who could not find a ready supply of oil. Because smaller refiners had limited production capabilities, the decision further delayed gasoline supply.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monetarypolicy.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Monetary policy</a> leading up to the crisis also seemingly played a role to a degree. The <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fomc.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Federal Open Market Committee</a> (FOMC) was reluctant to raise target interest rates too quickly and this hesitation contributed to rising inflation late in the decade. The jump in inflation was accompanied by higher prices for energy and a range of other consumer products and services.\n", "\nAmid the crisis, politicians actively encouraged consumers to conserve energy and limit unnecessary travel. In subsequent years, the 1979 crisis led to the sale of more compact and subcompact vehicles in the U.S. These smaller vehicles had smaller engines and provided better fuel economy.\n", "\nIn addition, the crisis prompted <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/utilities_sector.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">utility companies</a> worldwide to seek out alternatives to crude oil generators, including nuclear power plants, and governments to spend billions on the research and development (R&amp;D) of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/060415/what-are-main-substitutes-oil-and-gas-energy.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">other fuel sources</a>.\n", "\nCombined, these efforts resulted in daily worldwide oil consumption declining in the six years following the crisis. Meanwhile, the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/opec.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries</a>\u00a0(OPEC) global <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketshare.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">market share</a> fell to 29% in 1985, down from 50% in 1979.\n"]}
