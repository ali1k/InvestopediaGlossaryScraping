Merchant banks are experts in international trade, which makes them specialists in dealing with multinational corporations. Unlike retail or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commercialbank.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">commercial banks</a>, merchant banks do not provide financial services to the general public. Some of the largest merchant banks in the world include J.P. Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, and Citigroup.\n", "\nMerchant banks are <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financialinstitution.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">financial institutions</a> and companies that deal with international finance for <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/multinationalcorporation.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">multinational corporations</a>. These banks differ from other types of financial institutions. As such, they don't deal with the general public. They don't provide everyday financial services such as checking accounts, bill payments, or basic investments and don't take deposits or make withdrawals for their customers.\n", "\nInstead, merchant banks traditionally perform international financing and underwriting including <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/realestate.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">real estate</a>, trade finance, and foreign investment. They may be involved in issuing <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/letterofcredit.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">letters of credit</a> (LOCs) and in the transfer of funds. They may also consult on trades and trading technology. Merchant banks use more creative forms of financing. They typically work with companies that may not be large enough to raise funds from the public through an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ipo.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">initial public offering</a> (IPO). Merchant banks help corporations issue securities through <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/privateplacement.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">private placement</a>, which require less regulatory disclosure and are sold to sophisticated investors.\n", "\nMerchant banks may also be involved in arranging other international transactions. Let's say Company ABC\u2013based in the United States\u2014wants to buy Company XYZ in Germany, it would hire a merchant bank to facilitate the process. That bank would advise Company ABC on how to structure the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/transaction.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">transaction</a>. It may also help ABC in the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financing.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">financing</a> and underwriting process.\n", "\nThe term merchant bank is used to describe <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investmentbank.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">investment banks</a> in the United Kingdom but has a more narrow focus in the United States. Merchant banks may act like investment banks in the U.S. but tend to focus on services tailored to multinational corporations and high net worth individuals who do business in more than one country.\n", "\nIf a multinational corporation operates in many different countries, a merchant bank can finance business operations in all those countries and manage the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currency-exchange.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">currency exchanges</a> as funds are transferred and provide the funds to make the purchase using a letter of credit. Using the example above, the sellers in Germany receive a LOC issued by the merchant bank hired by Company ABC as payment for the purchase. The merchant can also help the Company ABC work through the legal and regulatory issues required to do business in Germany.\n", "\nThere's a very fine line between <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/investmentbank_vs_merchantbank.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">merchant and investment banks</a>. Investment banks underwrite and sell securities to the general public through IPOs. The bank\u2019s clients are large corporations that are willing to invest the time and money necessary to register securities for sale to the public. Investment banks also provide advisory services to companies about <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mergersandacquisitions.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mergers and acquisitions</a> (M&amp;A) and provide investment research to clients.\n", "\nWhile merchant banks are fee-based, investment banks have a two-fold income structure. They may collect fees based on the advisory services they provide to their clients, but may also be fund-based, meaning they can earn <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/income.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">income</a> from <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interest.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">interest</a> and other leases.\n", "\nRegardless of how a company sells securities, there are some minimum <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/disclosure.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">disclosure</a> requirements to inform investors. Both IPOs and private placements require a company audit by an external <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cpa.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">certified public accountant</a> (CPA) firm, which provides an opinion on the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-statements.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">financial statements</a>. Audited financial statements must include several years of financial data along with disclosures. Potential investors can use this information about the risks and potential rewards of buying the securities.\n"]}
