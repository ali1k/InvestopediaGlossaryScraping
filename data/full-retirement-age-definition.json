In the U.S., for example, the full retirement age for receiving <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/social-security-benefits.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Social Security benefits</a> is 67 years of age for persons born in 1960 or after, 66 for people born from 1943 to 1954, and 66 and two, four, six, eight, or 10 months for people born from 1955 to 1959 (the age increases by two months each successive year). Claiming benefits prior to your full retirement age will reduce your benefit, while claiming after your FRA will increase them by 8% annually with the maximum benefit occurring at age 70.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nFull retirement age also applies to pension plans, such as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/employer_sponsored_plan.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">employer-sponsored plans</a>.

At age 65 you will get 86.7% of the full retirement benefit.
