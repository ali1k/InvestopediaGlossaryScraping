Oversupply results when demand is lower than supply, resulting in a surplus.\u00a0Simply put, an oversupply is when there is more product for sale than people are prepared to buy. There are many reasons why oversupply may occur. There can be an oversupply of a current product due to people waiting for an improved model in a series, such as smartphones from a particular maker.\u00a0Oversupply can also occur in situations where the price of the good or service is too high and people are simply not prepared to buy it at that price. An oversupply may also simply be a case of a producer completely misreading the market demand for a product.\n", "\nAlthough the context can vary, oversupply results from overproduction and leads to the\u00a0accumulation of unsalable inventories.\u00a0Price levels and\u00a0oversupply\u00a0are strongly correlated.\n", "\nWhen a price is too high, demand will diminish\u00a0and the unsold quantity will increase unless the producer discounts the good or halts production. Discounting product is the most obvious way to deal with an oversupply, and it is often the only way to clear <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inventoryturnover.asp\">unsold inventory</a> if new product is on its way. Discounting does impact the bottom line of the seller and the seller may have agreements that share that pain back with the producer.\n", "\nIn commodity markets, oversupply is more of a market condition than a problem to be solved. For commodities like oil, natural gas, precious metals, meat and so on, the production timeline requires a significant lead time and the prices are all market-based. If, for example, a number of large scale gas fields begin production at the same time, there will be an oversupply of natural gas on the market leading to a lower price. During periods of oversupply, producers may actually lose money on the units they are selling.\n", "\nThe interesting thing about some types of commodity oversupply is that it is not a matter of unsold inventory, but how much of the commodity can be stored and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/crude-stockpiles.asp\">stockpiled</a> before it eventually sells at whatever the market will pay. Because production cannot be easily dialed up and down, commodity producers depend on storage to help remove supply from the market while production cycles adjust to the longer-term lower demand. Of course, if too much production is curtailed, then the market will be undersupplied and more investment will flow into the production side. This is one of the many reasons that many commodities have cyclical <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/boom-and-bust-cycle.asp\">boom and bust</a> pricing charts.\n", "\nOversupply and its impact on market <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equilibrium.asp\">equilibrium</a> is best understood through an example. Suppose the price of a computer\u00a0is $600 at a volume of\u00a01,000 units, but demand only requires 300 units. In such a situation,\u00a0sellers are seeking to sell 700 more computers\u00a0than buyers are willing to purchase. The oversupply of\u00a0700\u00a0puts the market for computers\u00a0in\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/disequilibrium.asp\">disequilibrium</a>. Since they're not able to sell all the computers\u00a0for the\u00a0desired price of $600, sellers consider a price reduction to make the\u00a0product more attractive to\u00a0buyers. In response to the reduction in the price of the product, consumers demand\u00a0increases and producers cut production. Eventually, the market will\u00a0achieve\u00a0equilibrium price and quantity, absent the introduction of other external factors, see also <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/walras-law.asp\">Walrus' law</a>.\u00a0\n"]}
