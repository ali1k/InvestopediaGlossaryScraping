That means that a stock that goes from $9 to at least $9.01 would be considered to be on an uptick. Conversely, if it goes from $9 to $8.99, it would be on a\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/downtick.asp\">downtick</a>.\n", "\nA stock can only experience an uptick if enough investors are willing to step in and buy it. Consider a stock that is trading at $9/$9.01.

If the stock's sellers significantly outnumber buyers, this lower bid will likely be snapped up by them.\n", "\nIn this manner, the stock may trade down to $8.80, for example, without an uptick. At this point, however, the selling pressure may have eased up because the remaining sellers are willing to wait, while buyers who think the stock is cheap may increase their bid to $8.81. If a transaction occurs at $8.81, it would be considered an uptick, since the previous transaction was at $8.80.\n", "\nThere are several terms that contain the word uptick. They include <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/z/zero_uptick.asp\">zero uptick</a>, which refers to a transaction executed at the same price as the trade immediately preceding it, but at a price higher than the transaction before that; <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/uptickvolume.asp\">uptick volume</a>, meaning the number of shares traded while a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/04/100804.asp\">stock price is rising</a>; and the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/uptickrule.asp\">uptick rule</a>.\n", "\nThe significance of an uptick in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-market.asp\">financial markets</a> is largely related to the uptick rule. This directive, originally in place from 1938 to 2007, dictated that a\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortsale.asp\">short sale</a>\u00a0could only be made on an uptick.

Such concerted selling may attract more bears and scare buyers away, creating an imbalance that could lead to a precipitous decline in a faltering stock.\n", "\nIn February 2010, the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp\">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC)\u00a0introduced an \u201calternative uptick rule,\" designed to promote market stability<strong> </strong>and preserve investor confidence during periods of volatility.\n", "\nThe new rule states that short selling\u00a0a stock that has already declined by at least 10% in one day would only be permitted on an uptick. It is hoped that this will give investors enough time to exit <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long.asp\">long positions</a> before bearish sentiment potentially spirals out of control, leading them to lose a fortune.\n", "\nMost securities are covered by the rule. In the event it is activated, the alternative uptick rule would apply to short sale orders for the remainder of the day, as well as the following day.\n"]}
