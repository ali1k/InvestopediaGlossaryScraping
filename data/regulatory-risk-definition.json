A <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/legislativerisk.asp\">change in laws or regulations</a> made by the government or a regulatory body can increase the costs of operating a business, reduce the attractiveness of an\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investment.asp\">investment</a>,\u00a0or change the competitive landscape.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/systemically-important-financial-institution-sifi.asp\">Financial institutions</a> face regulatory risk with respect to capital requirements, services, and products they are allowed to engage in, and disclosure practices. Salient to investors that brokers serve\u00a0would be a change in the amount of margin that investment accounts can possess. If margin requirements are tightened, the impact on the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockmarket.asp\">stock market</a>\u00a0could be material, as this would force <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investor.asp\">investors</a> to either meet the new margin requirements or sell off their margined positions.\n", "\nFor example, the utilities are heavily regulated\u00a0in the way they operate, including the quality of infrastructure and the amount that can be charged to customers. For this reason, these companies face a regulatory risk that can arise from events\u2014such as a change in the rates they can charge\u2014that may make operating the business more difficult.\n", "\nA plethora of regulatory risk examples exist. One of the best places to directly learn about this type of risk to a particular company is its annual filing (or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/10-k.asp\">10-K</a>). Each 10-K filing contains a section on material risks to company operations. Regulatory risks customarily are mentioned\u2014and sometimes discussed in great detail, as is the case for the drug industry, for example. They're a common issue for <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/omnibusaccount.asp\">omnibus accounts</a>.\n"]}
