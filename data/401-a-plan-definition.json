Each comes with different stipulations, restrictions, and some are better suited for certain types of employers.\n", "\nA 401(a) plan is a type of retirement plan made available to those working in government agencies, educational institutions, and non-profit organizations.\u00a0Eligible employees who participate in the plan include government employees, teachers, administrators, and support staff. A 401(a) plan's features are similar to a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/401kplan.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">401(k) plan</a>, which are more common in profit-based industries. 401(a) plans do not allow employees to contribute to 401(k) plans, however.\n", "\nIf an individual leaves an employer, they do have the option of transferring the funds in their 401(a) to a 401(k) plan or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ira.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">individual retirement account</a> (IRA).\n", "\nEmployers can form multiple 401(a) plans, each with distinct eligibility criteria, contribution amounts, and vesting schedules. Employers use these\u00a0plans to create incentive programs for employee retention. The employer controls the plan and determines the contribution limits.\n", "\nTo participate in a 401(a) plan, an individual must be 21 years of age and have been working in the job for a minimum of two years. These conditions are subject to vary.\n", "\nA 401(a) plan\u00a0can have mandatory or voluntary contributions, and the employer decides if contributions are made on an after-tax or pre-tax basis. An employer contributes funds to the plan on an employee's behalf. Employer contribution options include the employer paying a set amount into an employee's plan, matching a fixed percentage of employee contributions, or matching employee contributions within a specific dollar range.\n", "\nThe majority of voluntary contributions to a 401(a) plan are capped at 25% of an employee's annual pay.\n", "\nThe plan gives employers more control over their employees' investment choices. Government employers with\u00a0401(a) plans\u00a0often limit investment options to only the safest and most secure\u00a0options to minimize risk.

Becoming fully vested in the\u00a0employer contributions depends on the vesting schedule the employer sets up.
