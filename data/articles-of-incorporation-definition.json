Articles of incorporation generally contain pertinent information, such as the firm\u2019s name, street address, agent for service of process,\u00a0and the amount and type of stock to be issued.\n", "\nArticles of incorporation are also referred to as the \"corporate charter,\" \"articles of association,\"\u00a0or \"certificate of incorporation.\"\n", "\nMany businesses in the U.S. and Canada\u00a0are formed as a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corporation.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">corporation</a>, which is a type of business operation that is formed in the state where the company carries out its operations. To be recognized legally as a corporation, a business must incorporate by taking certain steps and making certain decisions required under corporate law. One such step is filing a document known as articles of incorporation.\n", "\nArticles of incorporation are in the document necessary to register a corporation with a state and acts as a charter to recognize the establishment of a corporation. The document outlines the basic information needed to form a corporation, the governance of a corporation,\u00a0and the corporate statutes in the state where the articles of incorporation are filed.\n", "\nIn the U.S., articles of incorporation are filed with the Office of the Secretary of State in the state where the business chooses to incorporate.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff Some states offer more favorable regulatory and tax environments and, as a result, attract a greater proportion of firms seeking incorporation.\n", "\nFor example, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/delaware-corporation.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Delaware</a> and Nevada attract about half of the public corporations in the U.S., in part because of the state laws that protect their corporations. Once established, the articles become a public record and provide important information about the corporation.\n", "\nThe articles in the document vary by state, but the following \"articles\" are typically included:\n", "\nMost states also require the articles to state the firm\u2019s purpose, though the corporation may define its purpose very broadly to maintain flexibility in its operations. Amazon\u2019s certificate of incorporation, for example, states that the corporation\u2019s purpose is \u201cto engage in any lawful act or activity for which corporations may be organized under the General Corporation Law of Delaware.\u201d<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nOther provisions outlined in a company\u2019s articles of incorporation may include the limitation of the directors\u2019 liability, actions by stockholders without a meeting,\u00a0and the authority to call special meetings of stockholders. Each state has certain mandatory provisions that must be contained in the articles of incorporation and other optional provisions that the company can decide whether to include.\n", "\nMany states charge filing\u00a0fees for a business that incorporates in the state, whether the business operates there or not.\u00a0A business that is incorporated in one state and is physically located or doing business in another state must register in the other state as well, which involves paying that state's filing fees and taxes.\n", "\nDepending on the state of incorporation, a company may pay filing fees ranging from $50 (as in Iowa<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff , Arkansas<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff ,\u00a0and Michigan<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"5\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff ) to $275 (as in Massachusetts)\u00a0<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"6\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff as of 2020.
