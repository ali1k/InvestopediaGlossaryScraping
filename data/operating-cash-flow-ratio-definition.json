Operating cash flow is the cash generated by a company's normal business operations.\u00a0\n", "\nA company generates revenues\u2014and deducts the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cogs.asp\">cost of goods sold</a> (COGS) and other associated operating expenses, such as attorney fees and utilities, from those revenues. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/032615/what-are-some-examples-cash-flow-operating-activities.asp\">Cash flow from operations</a> is the cash equivalent of net income. It is the cash flow after operating expenses have been deducted and before the commencement of new investments or financing activities.\n", "\nInvestors tend to prefer reviewing the cash flow from operations over <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/netincome.asp\">net income</a> because there is less room to manipulate results. However, together, cash flows from operations and net income can provide a good indication of the quality of a firm's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earnings.asp\">earnings</a>.\u00a0\n", "\nCurrent liabilities are all liabilities due within one <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiscalyear.asp\">fiscal year</a> (FY) or operating cycle, whichever is longer.

To investors and analysts, a low ratio could mean that the firm needs more capital.\n", "\nHowever, there could be many interpretations, not all of which point to poor financial health. For example, a firm may embark on a project that compromises cash flows temporarily but renders substantial rewards in the future.\n", "\nBoth the operating cash flow ratio and the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentratio.asp\">current ratio</a> measure a company\u2019s ability to pay short-term debts and obligations.\n", "\nThe operating cash flow ratio assumes cash flow from operations will be used to pay those current obligations (i.e., current liabilities).

Over the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/ttm.asp\">trailing 12 months</a>, Walmart had generated $27.8 billion in operating cash flow, while Target generated $6 billion.\n", "\nThe operating cash flow ratio for Walmart is 0.36, or $27.8 billion divided by $77.5 billion. Target\u2019s operating cash flow ratio works out to 0.34, or $6 billion divided by $17.6 billion. The two had similar ratios, meaning they had similar liquidity. Digging deeper, we find that the two also shared similar current ratios as well, further validating that they indeed had similar liquidity profiles.\n", "\nAlthough not as prevalent as with net income, companies can manipulate operating cash flow ratios. Some companies deduct <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/depreciation.asp\">depreciation</a> expenses from revenue even though it does not represent a real outflow of cash.\n", "\nDepreciation expense is an accounting convention that is meant to write off the value of assets over time. As a result, companies should add depreciation back to cash in cash flow from operations.\n"]}
