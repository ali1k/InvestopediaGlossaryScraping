In other words, it shows how much easily-convertible-to-money assets, such as cash, short-term investments, equities, and corporate and government bonds nearing maturity, an insurance company can tap into on short notice to meet its financial obligations.\n", "\nThe quick liquidity ratio is also commonly referred to as the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/acidtest.asp\">acid-test ratio</a> or the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quickratio.asp\">quick ratio</a>.\n", "\nInvestors<strong> </strong>have at their disposal several different <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidityratios.asp\">liquidity ratios</a> to assess a company\u2019s ability to quickly and cheaply convert whatever assets it owns into cash. The quick liquidity ratio, which generally accounts only for resources that can be transformed into cash without losing value within 90 days, is widely considered to be one of the most stringent ways to determine a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtor.asp\">debtor's</a> capacity to pay off current debt obligations without needing to raise external capital.\n", "\nQuick\u00a0liquidity ratios\u00a0are usually expressed as a percentage. The higher the percentage, the more <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp\">liquid</a> and capable of paying off any money owed the company is.\n", "\nWhen evaluating a potential investment in an insurance company an investor should evaluate the types of plans that it offers, as well as how the company intends on covering its liabilities in the case of an emergency. The range of percentages considered \u201cgood\u201d depend on the type of policies that an insurance company is providing. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/property-insurance.asp\">Property insurers</a> are likely to have quick liquidity ratios greater than 30 percent, while <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liability_insurance.asp\">liability insurers</a> may have ratios above 20 percent.\n", "\nThe quick liquidity ratio is an important measure of an insurance company\u2019s ability to cover its liabilities with relatively\u00a0liquid <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp\">assets</a>.\n", "\nSuppose an insurer covers a lot of property in Florida and then a hurricane strikes in the region. That insurer is now going to have to find more money than it would normally anticipate to pay <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurance_claim.asp\">claims</a>. If such an insurer has\u00a0a high quick liquidity ratio, it will be in a better position to make payments\u00a0than an insurer with a lower ratio.\n", "\nLike the quick liquidity ratio, the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentratio.asp\">current ratio</a> also measures a company's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortterm.asp\">short-term</a>\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp\">liquidity</a>,\u00a0or ability to generate enough cash to pay off all debts should they become due at once. The quick liquidity ratio is deemed to be more conservative than the current ratio, though, because it takes fewer assets into consideration.\n", "\nThe\u00a0quick liquidity\u00a0ratio further refines the\u00a0current ratio\u00a0by measuring the level of the most\u00a0liquid\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentassets.asp\">current assets</a> available to cover <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentliabilities.asp\">current liabilities</a>. It doesn\u2019t include inventory and other assets such as prepaid expenses that are generally perceived as more difficult and slower to turn into cash.\n", "\nThat ultimately means quick liquidity ratios and current ratios can differ significantly. For instance, a company stocking lots of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inventory.asp\">inventory</a> could have a high current ratio and low quick liquidity ratio. Investors concerned about this company\u2019s short-term liabilities might opt to dismiss the current ratio and focus more on the quick liquidity ratio, mindful that its inventory, though valuable, may be difficult to offload and turn into cash swiftly enough to settle a sudden hike in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/obligation.asp\">obligations</a>.\n", "\nA company that offers a mixture of different types of insurance policies is best compared to peers that offer a similar mixture, as opposed to comparing that company to insurers who only offer a specific and smaller range of products.\n", "\nIn addition to evaluating the quick liquidity ratio, investors should look at a company\u2019s\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/current-liquidity.asp\">current liquidity</a>\u00a0ratio, which shows how well it can cover liabilities with invested assets, and\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/overall-liquidity-ratio.asp\">overall liquidity ratio</a>,\u00a0which shows how a company can cover liabilities with total assets.\u00a0\n", "\nInvestors can also review <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operatingcashflow.asp\">operating cash flows</a> (OCF) and net <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashflow.asp\">cash flows</a> to determine how the company can meet its short-term liquidity needs from cash.\n"]}
