Multiple debts are combined into a single, larger debt, such as a loan, usually with more favorable payoff terms\u2014a lower interest rate, lower monthly payment, or both. Debt consolidation can be used as a tool to deal with student loan debt, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-card-debt.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">credit card debt</a>, and other liabilities.\n", "\nDebt consolidation is the process of using different forms of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financing.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">financing</a> to pay off other debts and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liability.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">liabilities</a>. If you are saddled with different kinds of debt, you can apply for a loan to consolidate those debts into a single liability and pay them off. Payments are then made on the new debt until it is paid off in full.\n", "\nMost people apply through their bank, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditunion.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">credit union</a>, or credit card company for a debt consolidation loan as their first step. It's a good place to start, especially if you have a great relationship and payment history with your institution. If you\u2019re turned down, try exploring private <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortgage-company.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mortgage companies</a> or lenders.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditor.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Creditors</a> are willing to do this for several reasons. Debt consolidation maximizes the likelihood of collecting from a debtor. These loans\u00a0are usually offered by financial institutions such as banks and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditunion.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">credit unions</a>, but there are other specialized debt consolidation service companies that provide these services to the general public.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nAn important point to note is that debt consolidation loans don\u2019t erase the original debt. Instead, they simply transfer a consumer's loans\u00a0to a different <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lender.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lender</a> or type of loan.

Secured loans are backed by one of the borrower\u2019s assets, such as a house or a car. The asset, in turn, works as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/collateral/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">collateral</a> for the loan.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unsecuredloan.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Unsecured loans</a>, on the other hand, are not backed by assets and can be more difficult to obtain. They also tend to have higher interest rates and lower qualifying amounts. With either type of loan, interest rates are still typically lower\u00a0than the rates charged on credit cards.

These are designed specifically for consumers who want to pay down multiple, high-interest debts.\n", "\nAnother method is to consolidate all your credit card payments into a new credit card. This new card can be a good idea if it charges little or no interest for a set period of time.

Longer payment schedules mean paying more in the long run. If you consider consolidation loans, speak to your credit card issuer(s) to find out how long it will\u00a0take to pay off debts at their current interest rate and compare that to the potential new loan.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nThere's also the potential loss of special provisions on school debt, such as interest rate discounts and other rebates. Consolidating debt can cause these provisions to disappear.

In a lot of cases, this may be decided by your lender, who may choose the order in which creditors are repaid. If not, pay off your highest-interest debt first. However, if you have a lower-interest loan that is causing you more emotional and mental stress than the higher-interest ones (such\u00a0a personal loan that has strained\u00a0family relations), you may want to start with that one instead.\n", "\nSay you have three credit cards and owe a total of $20,000 at a 22.99% annual rate <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/compoundinterest.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">compounded</a> monthly. You would need to pay $1,047.37 a month for 24 months to bring the balances down to zero. This works out to $5,136.88 paid in interest alone over time.\n", "\nIf you consolidated those credit cards into a lower-interest loan at an 11% annual rate compounded monthly, you would need to pay $932.16 a month for 24 months to bring the balance to zero.

The monthly savings would be $115.21, and a savings of $2,765.04 over the life of the loan.\n", "\nEven if the monthly payment stays the same, you can still come out ahead by streamlining your loans.

Your cards are maxed out at $5,000 each and you're spending $250 a month on each card's minimum payment. If you were to pay off each credit card separately, you would spend $750 each month for 28 months and you would end up paying a total of around $5,441.73 in interest.\n", "\nHowever, if you transfer the balances of those three cards into one consolidated loan at a more reasonable 12% interest rate and you continue to repay the loan with the same $750 a month, you'll pay roughly one-third of the interest\u2014$1,820.22\u2014and you can retire your loan five months earlier. This amounts to a total savings of $7,371.51\u2014$3,750 for payments and $3,621.51\u00a0in interest.\n"]}
