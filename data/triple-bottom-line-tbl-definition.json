TBL theory posits that instead of one bottom line, there should be three: profit, people, and the planet. A TBL seeks to gauge a corporation's level of commitment to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corp-social-responsibility.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">corporate social responsibility</a> and its impact on the environment over time.\n", "\nIn 1994, John Elkington\u2014the famed British management consultant and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sustainability.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sustainability</a> guru\u2014coined the phrase \"triple bottom line\" as his way of measuring performance in corporate America. The idea was that a company can be managed in a way that not only makes money but which also improves people's lives and the planet.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nIn finance, when we speak of a company's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bottomline.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bottom line</a>, we usually mean its profits. Elkington's TBL framework advances the goal of sustainability in business practices, in which companies look beyond profits to include social and environmental issues to measure <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/costofcapital.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the<strong> </strong>full cost of doing business</a>.\n", "\nTBL theory also says that if a company focuses on finances only and does not<em> </em>examine how it interacts socially, then that company is not able to see the whole picture, so cannot account for the full cost of doing business.\n", "\nAccording to TBL theory, companies should be working simultaneously on these three bottom lines:\n", "\nA key challenge of the TBL, according to Elkington, is the difficulty of measuring the social and environmental bottom lines. Profitability is inherently quantitative, so it is easy to measure. What constitutes social and environmental responsibility, however, is somewhat subjective. How do you put a dollar value on an oil spill\u2014or on preventing one\u2014for example?\n", "\nIt can be difficult to switch gears between priorities that are seemingly antithetical\u2014like maximizing individual financial returns while also doing the greatest good for society. Some companies might struggle to balance deploying money and other resources, such as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/humancapital.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">human capital</a>, to all three bottom lines without favoring one at the expense of another.\n", "\nThere can be dire repercussions of ignoring the TBL in the name of profits. Three well-known examples of this are the\n", "\nConsider a clothing manufacturer whose best way to maximize profits might be to hire the least expensive labor possible and to dispose of manufacturing waste in the cheapest way possible. These practices might well result in the greatest possible profits for the company, but at the expense of miserable working and living conditions for laborers, and harm to the natural environment and the people who live in that environment.\n", "\nToday, the corporate world is more conscious than ever of its social and environmental responsibility. Companies are increasingly adopting or ramping up their social programs.
