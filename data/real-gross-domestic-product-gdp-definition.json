Essentially, it measures a country's total economic output, adjusted for price changes.

The GDP price deflator is considered to be a more appropriate inflation measure for measuring economic growth than the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumerpriceindex.asp\">consumer price index</a> (CPI) because it isn't based on a fixed basket of goods.\n", "\nThe <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bea.asp\">Bureau of Economic Analysis</a> (BEA) provides a quarterly report on GDP<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\"></span> with headline data statistics representing real GDP levels and real GDP growth.

Unlike <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/what-is-gdp/\">nominal GDP,\u00a0real GDP</a> accounts for changes in price levels and provides a more accurate figure of economic growth.\n", "\nBecause GDP is one of the most important metrics for evaluating the economic activity, stability, and growth of goods and services in an economy, it is usually reviewed from two angles: nominal and real. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nominalgdp.asp\">Nominal GDP</a>\u00a0is a macroeconomic assessment of the value of goods and services using current prices in its measure. Nominal GDP is also referred to as the current dollar GDP. Real GDP takes into consideration adjustments for changes in inflation. This means that if inflation is positive, real GDP will be lower than nominal, and vice versa. Without a real GDP adjustment, positive inflation greatly inflates GDP in nominal terms.\n", "\nEconomists use the BEA\u2019s real GDP headline data for macroeconomic analysis and central bank planning. The main difference between nominal GDP and real GDP is the adjustment for inflation. Since nominal GDP is calculated using current prices, it does not require any adjustments for inflation. This makes comparisons from quarter to quarter and year to year much simpler, though less relevant, to calculate and analyze.\n", "\nAs such, real GDP provides a better basis for judging long-term national economic performance than nominal GDP. Using a GDP price deflator, real GDP reflects GDP on a per quantity basis. Without real GDP, it would be difficult to identify just from examining nominal GDP whether production is actually expanding\u2014or it's just a factor of rising per-unit prices in the economy.\n", "\nA positive difference in nominal minus real GDP signifies inflation and a negative difference signifies deflation. In other words, when nominal is higher than real, inflation is occurring and when real is higher than nominal, deflation is occurring.\u00a0\n", "\nCalculating real GDP is a complex process typically best provided by the BEA.

This is opposed to nominal GDP that does not account for inflation. Adjusting for constant prices makes it a measure of \"real\" economic output for apples-to-apples comparison over time and between countries.\n", "\nReal GDP is an inflation-adjusted measurement of a country\u2019s economic output over the course of a year. The U.S. GDP is primarily measured based on the expenditure approach and calculated using the following formula: GDP = C + G + I + NX (where C=consumption; G=government spending; I=Investment; and NX=net exports).\u00a0\n", "\nIn inflationary periods, real GDP will be lower than nominal GDP. In deflationary times, real GDP will be higher.\n", "\nTake for example a hypothetical country that had a nominal GDP of $100 Billion in 2000, which grew by 50% to $150 billion by 2020. Over the same period of time, inflation reduced the\u00a0relative purchasing power of the dollar by 50%. Looking at just the nominal GDP, the economy appears to be performing very well, whereas the real GDP expressed in 2000 dollars would actually indicate a reading of $75 billion, revealing in fact a net overall decline in economic growth had occurred. It is due to this greater accuracy that real GDP is favored by economists as a method of measuring economic performance\n", "\nCountries with larger GDPs will have a greater amount of goods and services generated within them, and will generally have a higher standard of living. For this reason, many citizens and political leaders see GDP growth as an important measure of national success, often referring to \u201cGDP growth\u201d and \u201ceconomic growth\u201d interchangeably. GDP enables policymakers and central banks to judge whether the economy is contracting or expanding, whether it needs a boost or restraint, and if a threat such as a recession or inflation looms on the horizon. By accounting for inflation, real GDP is a better gauge of the change in production levels from one period to another.\n", "\nMany economists have argued that GDP should not be used as a proxy for overall economic success, much less the success of a society more generally. Like any measure, GDP has its imperfections. For instance, it does not account for the informal economy, does not count care work or domestic labor done in the home, ignores business-to-business activity, and counts costs and wastes as economic activity, among other shortcomings. In recent decades, governments have created various nuanced modifications in attempts to increase GDP accuracy and specificity. Means of calculating GDP have also evolved continually since its conception so as to keep up with evolving measurements of industry activity and the generation and consumption of new, emerging forms of digital and other intangible assets.\n"]}
