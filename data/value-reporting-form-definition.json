The irregular inventory may be differences in the quantity, quality, and specific items held.\u00a0The value reporting form enables the company to periodically report the values of this shifting stock\u00a0to the insurance provider.\n", "\nThe insurer,\u00a0in turn, adjusts the amount of coverage to reflect the value of the current inventory. Using a value reporting form can help the company avoid being overinsured or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underinsurance.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">underinsured</a>.

On one side of this method, the business is overinsured\u00a0and spending capital where it is not needed. On the opposite side, the company is putting itself at grave risk if any of many hazards should befall them. The company may split the difference between highs and lows and buy property insurance for the average amount of inventory. Once again, they are gambling they are on the right side of any possible loss.\n", "\nBusinesses may also use limit <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/endorsement.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">endorsements</a>\u00a0which allow changes to the policy throughout the term period, but will also impact the premium.

Value reporting submittal may happen daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, or even by the policy term. Depending on the frequency chosen, there are mandatory dates that the full accounting must arrive at the insurer's office. A company will also decide what to include and how to include items on the reporting form. However, a full and accurate accounting of costs for the reported stock is a requirement.\u00a0\n", "\nSome businesses will use the value reporting form for inventory and use separate <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/property-insurance.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">property insurance</a> coverage for items such as computers, desks, equipment, and other business property which remains relatively static throughout the year.\u00a0In this way,\u00a0companies can maintain an appropriate level of coverage by adjusting each month's or each quarter's insurance needs based on <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inventory-management.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">current inventories</a>.\n", "\nThe value reporting form must bear the signature of an authorized company officer or designated employee.
