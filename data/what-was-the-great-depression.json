Economists and historians often cite the Great Depression as the most catastrophic economic event of the 20th century.\n", "\nDuring the short depression\u00a0that lasted from\u00a01920 to 1921,\u00a0known as the Forgotten Depression, the U.S. stock market fell by nearly 50%, and corporate profits declined over 90%. However, the U.S. economy enjoyed robust growth during the rest of the decade. The Roaring Twenties, as the era came to be known, was a period when the American public discovered the stock market and dove in head first.\n", "\nSpeculative frenzies affected both the real estate markets and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).\u00a0Loose money supply\u00a0and high levels of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margincall.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">margin trading</a> by investors helped\u00a0to fuel\u00a0an unprecedented increase\u00a0in asset prices. The lead-up to October 1929 saw equity prices rise to all-time high multiples of more than 30-times earnings, and the benchmark Dow Jones Industrial Average increased\u00a0500% in just five years. The combination of these factors would ultimately <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042115/what-caused-stock-market-crash-1929-preceded-great-depression.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cause the stock market crash</a>.\n", "\nThe NYSE bubble burst violently Oct. 24, 1929, a day that came to be known as Black Thursday. A brief rally occurred Friday the 25th and during a half-day session Saturday the 26th. However, the following week brought Black Monday, Oct.\u00a028, and Black Tuesday, Oct.\u00a029. The Dow Jones Industrial Index (DJIA) fell more than 20% over those two days. The stock market would eventually fall almost 90% from its 1929 peak.\n", "\nRipples from the crash spread across the Atlantic Ocean to Europe\u00a0triggering other financial crises such as\u00a0the collapse of the Boden-Kredit Anstalt, Austria\u2019s most important bank. In 1931, the economic calamity hit both continents in full force.\n", "\nThe 1929 stock market crash wiped out <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nominal.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">nominal wealth</a>, both corporate and private, and sent the U.S. economy into a tailspin. In early 1929, the\u00a0U.S. unemployment rate was 3.2%; and by 1933, it had soared to 24.9%. Despite unprecedented interventions and government spending by both the Herbert Hoover and Franklin Delano Roosevelt administrations, the unemployment rate\u00a0remained above 18.9% in 1938.

Nor does it explain why the slump's depth and persistence were so severe. A\u00a0variety of specific events and policies contributed to the Great Depression and\u00a0helped to prolong it during the 1930s.\n", "\nThe relatively new <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalreservesystem.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Federal Reserve</a>\u00a0(the Fed) mismanaged the supply of money and credit before and after the crash in 1929. According to monetarists such as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/milton-friedman.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Milton Friedman</a> and acknowledged by former Federal Reserve Chairman <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/benbernanke.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ben Bernanke</a>.\n", "\nCreated in 1913, the Fed remained\u00a0inactive throughout the first eight years of its existence. After the economy recovered from the 1920 to 1921 depression, the Fed allowed significant\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expansionary_policy.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">monetary expansion</a>. Total money supply grew by $28 billion, a 61.8% increase between 1921 and 1928. Bank deposits increased\u00a0by 51.1%, savings and loan shares rose by 224.3%, and net life insurance policy reserves jumped 113.8%. All of this occurred\u00a0after the Federal Reserve cut required reserves to 3% in 1917.\u00a0Gains in gold reserves via the Treasury and Fed were only $1.16 billion.\n", "\nBy increasing the money supply and keeping the interest rate low during the decade, the Fed instigated the rapid expansion that preceded the collapse. Much of the surplus money supply growth inflated the stock market and real estate bubbles. After the bubbles burst\u00a0and the market crashed,\u00a0the Fed took the opposite course by cutting the money supply by nearly a third. This reduction caused\u00a0severe liquidity problems for many small banks and choked\u00a0off hopes for\u00a0a quick recovery.\n", "\nAs Bernanke noted in a November\u00a02002 address, before the Fed existed, bank panics were typically resolved within weeks. Large private financial institutions\u00a0would loan\u00a0money to the strongest smaller institutions\u00a0to maintain system integrity. That sort of scenario had occurred two decades earlier, during the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bank-panic-of-1907.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Panic of 1907</a>.\n", "\nWhen frenzied selling sent the New York Stock Exchange\u00a0spiraling downward and led to a bank run, investment banker J.P. Morgan stepped in to rally Wall Street denizens to move significant amounts of capital to banks lacking funds. Ironically, it was that panic that led the government to create the Federal Reserve\u00a0to cut its reliance on individual financiers such as\u00a0Morgan.\n", "\nAfter Black Thursday, the heads of several New York banks had tried to instill confidence by prominently purchasing large blocks of blue-chip stocks at above-market prices. While these actions caused a brief rally Friday, the panicked sell-offs resumed Monday. In the decades since 1907, the stock market had grown beyond the ability of such individual efforts. Now, only the Fed was big enough to prop up the U.S. financial system.\n", "\nHowever, the Fed failed to do so with a cash injection\u00a0between 1929 and 1932. Instead, it\u00a0watched the money supply collapse and let literally thousands of banks fail. At the time, banking laws made it very difficult for institutions to grow and diversify enough to survive a massive withdrawal of deposits or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bankrun.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">run on the bank</a>.\n", "\nThe Fed's harsh reaction, while difficult to understand, may have occurred because it feared that bailing out careless banks would only encourage fiscal irresponsibility in the future. Some historians argue that the Fed created\u00a0the conditions that caused the economy to overheat\u00a0and then exacerbated an already dire\u00a0economic situation.\n", "\nAlthough often characterized as a \"do-nothing\" president, Herbert Hoover did take action after the crash occurred. Between 1930 and 1932, he increased federal spending by 42% engaging in massive public works programs such as the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rfc.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Reconstruction Finance Corporation</a> (RFC) and raising taxes to pay for the programs. The president banned immigration in 1930 to keep low-skilled workers from flooding the labor market. Unfortunately, many of his and Congress' other post-crash interventions\u2014wage, labor, trade and price controls\u2014damaged the economy's ability to adjust and reallocate resources.\n", "\nOne of Hoover's main concerns was that workers' wages would be cut following the economic downturn. To ensure high paychecks in all industries, he reasoned, prices needed to stay high. To keep prices high, consumers would need to pay more. The public had been burned badly in the crash, and most people did not have the resources to spend lavishly on goods and services. Nor could\u00a0companies count on overseas trade, as foreign nations were not willing to buy overpriced American goods any more than Americans were.\n", "\nThis bleak reality forced Hoover to use legislation\u00a0to prop up prices and hence wages by choking out cheaper foreign competition. Following the tradition of protectionists, and against the protests of more than 1,000 of the nation's economists, Hoover\u00a0signed into law the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smoot-hawley-tariff-act.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930</a>. The Act was initially a way to protect agriculture\u00a0but swelled into a multi-industry tariff,\u00a0imposing huge duties on more than 880 foreign products. Nearly three dozen countries retaliated, and imports fell from $7 billion in 1929 to just $2.5 billion in 1932. By 1934, international trade had declined by 66%. Not surprisingly, economic conditions worsened worldwide.\n", "\nHoover's desire to maintain jobs and individual and corporate income levels was understandable. However, he encouraged businesses to raise wages, avoid layoffs, and keep prices high at a time when they naturally should have fallen. With previous cycles of recession/depression, the United States suffered one to three years of low wages and unemployment before dropping prices led to a recovery. Unable to sustain these artificial levels, and with global trade effectively cut off, the U.S. economy deteriorated\u00a0from a recession to a depression.\n", "\nVoted\u00a0into office in 1933, President Franklin Roosevelt promised massive change. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/new-deal.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The New Deal</a> he initiated was an innovative, unprecedented series of domestic programs and acts designed to bolster American business, reduce unemployment, and protect the public.\n", "\nLoosely based on <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/keynesianeconomics.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Keynesian economics</a>, its concept was that the government could and should stimulate the economy. The New Deal set lofty goals to create and maintain the national infrastructure, full employment, and healthy wages. The government set about achieving these goals through price, wage, and even production controls.\n", "\nSome economists claim that Roosevelt continued many of Hoover's interventions, just on a larger scale. He kept in place a rigid focus on price supports and minimum wages\u00a0and removed\u00a0the country from\u00a0the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/goldstandard.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">gold standard</a>,\u00a0forbidding individuals to hoard gold coins and bullion. He banned monopolistic, some consider them competitive, business practices, and instituted dozens of new public works programs and other job-creation agencies.\n", "\nThe Roosevelt administration paid farmers and ranchers to stop or cut back on production. One of the most heartbreaking conundrums of the period was the destruction of excess crops, despite the need for thousands of Americans to access affordable food.\n", "\nFederal taxes tripled between 1933 and 1940 to pay for these initiatives as well as new programs such as Social Security. These increases included hikes in excise taxes, personal income taxes, inheritance taxes, corporate income taxes, and an excess profits tax.\n", "\nThe New Deal re-instilled\u00a0public confidence, as there were measurable results, such as reform\u00a0and stabilization of\u00a0the financial system. Roosevelt declared a bank holiday for an entire week in March 1933 to prevent institutional collapse due to panicked withdrawals. A program of construction of\u00a0a network of dams, bridges, tunnels, and roads still in use followed. The projects offered employment for thousands via federal work programs.\n", "\nAlthough\u00a0the economy recovered to an extent, the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/011116/economic-effects-new-deal.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">rebound was far too weak </a>for the New Deal policies to be unequivocally deemed successful in pulling America out of the Great Depression.\n", "\nHistorians and economists disagree on the reason. Keynesians blame a lack of federal spending\u2014Roosevelt did not go far enough in his government-centric recovery plans. Conversely, others claim that by trying to spark immediate improvement, instead of letting the economic/business cycle follow its usual two-year course of hitting bottom and then rebounding, Roosevelt, like Hoover before him, may have prolonged the depression.\n", "\nA <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/421169?seq=6#metadata_info_tab_contents\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">study by two economists at the University of California</a>, Los Angeles, published in the August 2004 <em>Journal of Political Economy</em> estimated that the New Deal extended the Great Depression by at least seven years. However, it is possible that the relatively quick recovery, characteristic of other post-depression recovers, may not have occurred as rapidly post-1929. This difference is\u00a0because it was the first time that the general public, and not just the Wall Street elite, lost large amounts in the stock market.\n", "\nRobert Higgs, an American economic historian, has argued that Roosevelt's new rules and regulations came so fast and were so revolutionary\u2014as were his decisions to seek third and fourth terms\u2014that businesses became afraid to hire or invest. Philip Harvey, a professor of law and economics at Rutgers University, has suggested that Roosevelt was more interested in addressing social welfare concerns than creating a Keynesian-style macroeconomic <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stimulus-package.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">stimulus package</a>.\n", "\nAccording to the gross domestic product (GDP) and employment figures only, the Great Depression appeared to end suddenly around 1941 to 1942, just as the United States entered World War II. The unemployment rate fell from 8 million in 1940 to under 1 million in 1943. However, more than 16.2 million Americans were conscripted to fight in the Armed Services. In the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/private-sector.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">private sector,</a> the real unemployment rate grew during the war.\n", "\nDue to wartime shortages caused by rationing, the standard of living declined, and taxes rose dramatically to fund the war effort. Private investment dropped from $17.9 billion in 1940 to $5.7 billion in 1943, and total private sector production fell by nearly 50%.\n", "\nAlthough the notion that the war\u00a0ended the Great Depression is a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/08/broken-window-fallacy.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">broken window fallacy</a>, the conflict did put\u00a0the United States on the road to recovery.

Suddenly, there was\u00a0government demand for inexpensive products, and the\u00a0demand created a massive fiscal stimulus.\n", "\nWhen the war ended, the trade routes remained open. In the first 12 months afterward, private investments rose from $10.6 billion to $30.6 billion. The stock market broke into a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bullmarket.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bull run</a> in a few short years.\n", "\nThe Great Depression was the result of an unlucky combination of factors\u2014a flip-flopping Fed, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/protectionism.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">protectionist</a> tariffs, and inconsistently applied\u00a0government interventionist efforts. It could have been shortened or even avoided by a change in any one of these factors.\n", "\nWhile the debate\u00a0continues as to whether the interventions were appropriate, many of the reforms from the New Deal, such as Social Security, unemployment insurance, and agricultural <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/subsidy.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">subsidies</a>, exist to this day. The\u00a0assumption that the federal government should act in times of national economic crisis is now\u00a0strongly supported.
