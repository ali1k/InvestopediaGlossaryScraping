HR managers may have high expectations to fill a position, leading them to look for candidates with qualifications that are higher than required for a specific job. In essence, these managers are looking for a unicorn, which leads to a disconnect between their ideal candidate versus who they can hire from the pool of people available.\n", "\nA unicorn is what most people in the financial world call a startup that is privately-owned with a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valuation.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">valuation</a> exceeding $1 billion.

Startups that managed to reach the $1 billion mark, she noted, are so rare that finding one is as difficult as finding a mythical unicorn.\n", "\nAccording to Lee, the first unicorns were founded in the 1990s.

For example, data show that as of 2019, SV Angel has made the most early-stage investments in companies valued at over $1 billion.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"5\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff Still, others argue that globalization and the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/monetary-policy/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">monetary policy</a> of central banks since the Great Recession have created great waves of capital that slosh around the globe on a hunt for unicorns.\n", "\nThe value of unicorns is generally based on how investors and venture capitalists feel they will grow and develop, so it all comes down to longer-term <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forecasting.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">forecasting</a>.

Some familiar U.S.-based unicorns include Uber, Airbnb, SpaceX, Palantir Technologies, WeWork, and Pinterest.

Since then, Nuro has grown and acquired other startups including Ike Robotics.
