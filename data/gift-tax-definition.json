For something to be considered a gift, the receiving party cannot pay the giver full value for the gift, though they may pay an amount less than its full value.\n", "\nThe giver of the gift is required to pay the gift tax.

To prevent undue hardship to the recipient and oblige givers to honor their tax liability, the gift tax is applied to the gift giver.\n", "\nThe following are generally not subject to gift tax:\n", "\nAs the regulations applied to gift taxes are very complicated, it is best to check with your respective tax authorities if you have given anyone a gift valued at more than $15,000, the gift tax maximum in effect since the 2018 tax year.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff This means that an individual has been able to give another individual $15,000 or less per year without incurring a gift tax.\n", "\nAs of 2019, a single donor can gift up to $11,400,000 ($11,580,000 in 2020) in their lifetime before the gift tax is applied.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff Annual limits still apply; the lifetime exemption applies to amounts exceeding annual exclusions.\n", "\nNote that even if they file a joint tax return, spouses can each give $15,000 to the same recipient, raising that gift to $30,000 per year.

Because the annual exclusion limit is $15,000 per person, $25,000 of the total amount given is not excluded. However, the non-excluded amount reduces the lifetime exemption amount. So, after making these gifts, Taxpayer A has $11,555,000 remaining of the exemption to give before paying gift taxes.\n"]}
