Consequently, analysts and other economic experts expect the price\u00a0to drop eventually.\n", "\nOvervaluation may result from an uptick in\u00a0emotional trading, or illogical, gut-driven decision making that artificially inflates the stock's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market-price.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">market price</a>. Overvaluation can also occur due to deterioration in a company's fundamentals and financial strength. Potential investors strive to avoid overpaying for stocks.\n", "\nA small group of\u00a0market theorists believes that the market is <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/efficientmarkethypothesis.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">perfectly efficient</a>, by nature. They opine that <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundamentalanalysis.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fundamental analysis</a> of a stock is a pointless exercise\u00a0because the stock market is all-knowing. Therefore, stocks may neither be truly undervalued or overvalued. Contrarily, fundamental analysts are staunch in their belief that there are always opportunities to ferret out undervalued and overvalued stocks\u00a0because the market is as irrational as its participants.\n", "\nOvervalued stocks are ideal for investors looking to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">short a position</a>. This entails selling shares to capitalize on an anticipated price declines. Investors may also legitimately trade overvalued stocks at a premium due to the brand, superior management, or other factors that increase the value of one company's earnings over another.\n", "\nRelative earnings analysis is the most common way to identify an overvalued stock. This metric compares earnings to some comparable market value, such as price. The most popular comparison is the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-earningsratio.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">P/E ratio</a>, which analyzes a company's stock price relative to its earnings.\n", "\nAnalysts looking for stocks to short may seek overvalued companies with high P/E ratios, particularly\u00a0when compared to\u00a0other companies in the same sector or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/peer-group.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">peer group</a>. For example, assume a company has\u00a0a stock price of $100\u00a0and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eps.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">earnings per share</a> of $2. The calculation of its P/E ratio is determined by dividing the price by the earnings ($100/$2 = 50). So, in this example, the security is trading at 50 times earnings.\n", "\nIf that same company has a banner year and makes $10 in EPS, the new P/E ratio is $100 divided by $10, or 10 times ($100/$10 = 10). Most people would consider the company to be overvalued at a P/E of 50, but possibly undervalued at 10.\n", "\nAlthough by definition, a stock is overvalued only by the opinion of an analyst, The Motley Fool website is never shy about weighing in. For example, they deemed the pharma giant <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/01/30/is-eli-lilly-stock-overvalued.aspx\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Ely Lilly</a> to be overvalued because the company's valuation reached \"untenable levels following the company's meteoric rise during the tail end of 2019 and early days of 2020.\"\n", "\nAccording to The Motley Fool, in January 2020, the company's stock was the second most expensive among its industry peers and Eli Lilly might find it hard to deliver consistent expected growth.\n"]}
