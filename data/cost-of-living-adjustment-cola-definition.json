Cost-of-living adjustments are typically\u00a0equal to the percentage increase in the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cpi-w.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers</a> (CPI-W) for a specific period.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff So if someone received $10,000 in Social Security benefits last year and the COLA for this year is 4.1%, their benefits for this year would be $10,410. The COLA for 2021 is 1.3%, so that payment would rise to $10,130.\n", "\nBecause inflation was high during the 1970s, compensation-related contracts, real estate contracts, and government benefits used COLAs to protect against inflation. The <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bls.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> (BLS) determines the CPI-W, which is used by the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/ssa.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Social Security Administration</a> (SSA) to compute COLAs. The COLA formula is determined by applying the percentage increase in the CPI-W from the third quarter of one year to the third quarter of the following year. This information is updated regularly on the SSA website.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nCongress ratified a COLA provision to offer automatic yearly COLAs based on the annual increase in the CPI-W that went into effect in 1975. Prior to 1975, Social Security benefits were increased when Congress approved special legislation. In 1975, COLAs were based on the increase in the CPI-W from the second quarter of 1974 to the first quarter of 1975. From 1976 to 1983, COLAs were based on the increases in the CPI-W from the first quarter of the previous year to the first quarter of the current year. Since 1983, COLAs have been dependent on the CPI-W from the third quarter of the previous year to the third quarter of the current year.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nInflation levels ranged\u00a0from 5.7% to 11.3% in the 1970s. In 1975, the COLA increase was 8%, and the inflation rate was 9.1%. In 1980, the COLA reached the highest level in history at 14.3%, while the inflation rate was 13.5%. During\u00a0the 1990s, drastically lower inflation rates prompted small COLA increases averaging 2% to 3% per year. That continued into the early 2000s when even lower inflation rates resulted in no COLA increases at all in 2010, 2011,\u00a0and 2016.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff <span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff The COLA\u00a0for 2019 was 2.8%, and the COLA for 2020 is 1.6%.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff For 2021, it is 1.3%.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"7\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nCOLA is reliant on two components: The CPI-W and the employer-contracted COLA percentage. CPI determines the rate of inflation and is compared yearly. When consumer prices drop\u2014or if inflation has not been high enough to substantiate a COLA increase\u2014recipients do not receive a COLA. If there is no CPI-W increase, there is no COLA increase.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nWhen a COLA increase is not approved, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/medicare-part-b-premiums.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Medicare Part B premiums</a> remain the same for approximately\u00a070% of beneficiaries who get the premiums deducted from their Social Security checks. However, the remaining recipients\u2014such as those with higher incomes,\u00a0those who did not participate in Social Security through their employer, and new beneficiaries\u2014must pay the Medicare Part B premium increases.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff The standard monthly Medicare Part B premium set for 2021 is $148.50.
