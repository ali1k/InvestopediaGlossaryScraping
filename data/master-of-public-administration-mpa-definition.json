Programs are interdisciplinary and include classes in economics, sociology, law, anthropology, and political science. Most programs require two years for completion. Some executive MPA programs designed for experienced, mid-career professionals can be completed in one year. Also, a limited number of programs grant a Doctor of Public Administration (D.P.A.), which is a terminal degree usually intended for research. The D.P.A. is considered on par with a Ph.D.\n"]}
