Home equity loans allow homeowners to borrow against the equity in their home.\u00a0The loan amount is based on the difference between the home\u2019s current market value and the homeowner\u2019s mortgage balance due. Home equity loans tend to be fixed-rate, while the typical alternative, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/heloc/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">home equity\u00a0lines of credit</a> (HELOCs), generally have variable rates.\n", "\nEssentially, a home equity loan is akin to a mortgage, hence the name second mortgage. The equity in the home serves as collateral for the lender. The amount a homeowner is allowed to borrow will be partially based on a\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/combinedloantovalue.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">combined loan-to-value (CLTV) ratio</a> of 80% to 90% of the home\u2019s <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/appraisal.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">appraised</a> value. Of course, the amount of the loan and the rate of interest charged also depend on the borrower\u2019s <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit_score.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">credit score</a> and payment history.\n", "\nTraditional home equity loans have a set repayment term, just like conventional mortgages. The borrower makes regular, fixed payments covering both principal and interest. As with any mortgage, if the loan is not paid off, the home could be sold to satisfy the remaining debt.\n", "\nA home equity loan can be a good way to convert the equity you\u2019ve built up in your home into cash, especially if you invest that cash in home renovations that increase the value of your home. However, always remember that you\u2019re putting your home on the line\u2014if real estate values decrease, you could end up owing more than your home is worth.\n", "\nShould you want to relocate, you might end up losing money on the sale of the home or be unable to move. And if you\u2019re getting the loan to pay off credit card debt, resist the temptation to run up those credit card bills again. Before doing something that puts your house in jeopardy, weigh all of your options.\n", "\nHome equity loans exploded in popularity after the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxreformact1986.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tax Reform Act of 1986</a> because they provided a way for consumers to get around one of its main provisions\u2014the elimination of deductions for the interest on most consumer purchases.

When looking, \u201cdon\u2019t focus solely on large banks, but instead consider a loan with your local\u00a0credit union,\u201d recommends <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www.imove.com/blog/author/cjones/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Clair Jones</a>, a real estate and relocation expert who writes for Movearoo.com and iMove.com. \u201cCredit unions sometimes offer better interest rates and more-personalized account service if you\u2019re willing to deal with a slower application processing time.\u201d\n", "\nAs with a mortgage, you can ask for a\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/good_faith_estimate.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">good faith estimate</a>, but before you do, make your own honest estimate of your finances. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CaseyFleming.sbcglobal/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Casey Fleming</a>, mortgage advisor at C2 Financial Corporation and author of <em>The Loan Guide: How to Get the Best Possible Mortgage</em>, says, \u201cYou should have a good sense of where your credit and home value are before applying, in order to save money. Especially on the appraisal [of your home], which is a major expense. If your appraisal comes in too low to support the loan, the money is already spent\u201d\u2014and there are no refunds for not qualifying.\n", "\nBefore signing\u2014especially if you\u2019re using the home equity loan for debt consolidation\u2014run the numbers with your bank and make sure the loan\u2019s monthly payments will indeed be lower than the combined payments of all your current obligations. Even though home equity loans have lower interest rates, your term on the new loan could be longer than that of your existing debts.\n", "\nHome equity loans provide a single lump-sum payment to the borrower, which is repaid over a set period of time (generally five to 15 years) at an agreed-upon interest rate. The payment and interest rate remain the same over the lifetime of the loan. The loan must be repaid in full if the home on which it is based is sold.\n", "\nA HELOC is a revolving line of credit, much like a credit card, that you can draw on as needed, payback, and then draw on again, for a term determined by the lender. The draw period (five to 10 years) is followed by a repayment period when draws are no longer allowed (10 to 20 years).\u00a0HELOCs typically have a variable interest rate, but some lenders offer <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/heloc/fixed-rate-option/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">HELOC fixed-rate options</a>.\n", "\nThere are a number of key benefits to home equity loans, including cost, but there are also drawbacks.\n", "\nHome equity loans provide an easy source of cash and can be valuable tools for responsible borrowers. If you have a steady, reliable source of income and know that you will be able to repay the loan, low-interest rates and\u00a0possible tax deductions make home equity loans a sensible choice.\n", "\nObtaining a home equity loan is quite simple for many consumers because it is a secured debt. The lender runs a credit check and orders an appraisal of your home to determine your creditworthiness and the combined loan-to-value ratio.\n", "\nThe interest rate on a home equity loan\u2014although higher than that of a first mortgage\u2014is much lower than that on credit cards and other consumer loans. That helps explain why the primary reason consumers borrow against the value of their homes via a fixed-rate home equity loan is to pay off credit card balances.\n", "\nHome equity loans are generally a good choice if you know exactly how much you need to borrow and what you\u2019ll use the money for. You\u2019re guaranteed a certain amount, which you receive in full at closing. \u201cHome equity loans are generally preferred for larger, more expensive goals such as remodeling, paying for higher education, or even\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtconsolidation.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">debt consolidation</a>, since the funds are received in one lump sum,\u201d says <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www.rickairey.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Richard Airey</a>, a loan officer with First Financial Mortgage in Portland, Maine.\n", "\nThe main problem with home equity loans is that they can seem an all-too-easy solution for a borrower who may have fallen into a perpetual cycle of spending, borrowing, spending, and sinking deeper into debt. Unfortunately, this scenario is so common that lenders have a term for it:\u00a0\u201c<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reloading.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reloading</a>,\u201d which is basically the habit of taking out a loan in order to pay off existing debt and free up additional credit, which the borrower then uses to make additional purchases.\n", "\nReloading leads to a spiraling cycle of debt that often convinces borrowers to turn to home equity loans offering an amount worth 125% of the equity in the borrower\u2019s house. This type of loan often comes with higher fees because\u2014as the borrower has taken out more money than the house is worth\u2014the loan is not fully secured by collateral. Also, know that interest paid on the portion of the loan that is above the value of the home is\u00a0never tax-deductible.\n", "\nWhen applying for a home equity loan, there can be some temptation to borrow more than you immediately need, as you only get the payout once, and you don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll qualify for another loan in the future.\n", "\nIf you are contemplating a loan that is worth more than your home, it might be time for a reality check. Were you unable to live within your means when you owed only 100% of the equity in your home? If so, it will likely be unrealistic to expect that you\u2019ll be better off when you increase your debt by 25%, plus interest and fees. This could become a slippery slope to\u00a0bankruptcy and\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreclosure.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">foreclosure</a>.\n", "\nSay you have an auto loan with a balance of $10,000 at an interest rate of 9% with two years remaining on the term. Consolidating that debt to a home equity loan at a rate of 4% with a term of five years would actually cost you more money if you took all five years to pay off the home equity loan. Also, remember that your home is now collateral for the loan instead of your car. Defaulting could result in its loss, and losing your home would be significantly more catastrophic then surrendering a car.\n"]}
