Since its inception in the early 1970s, the group has discussed <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-crisis.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">financial crises</a>, monetary systems, and major world crises,\u00a0such as oil shortages.\n", "\nThe G-7 has also launched initiatives to fund issues and relieve crises where it sees an opportunity for joint action.

That, in turn, inspired French President Val\u00e9ry Giscard d\u2019Estaing to invite the leaders of\u00a0those countries, plus Italy, to Rambouillet in 1975 for further discussions on global oil, this time with the country's leaders joining the finance ministers; an attendance roster that has endured. The next year, Canada was invited to join the group.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"5\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nThe G-7 has responded as the global economy has evolved, including when the Soviet Union pledged to create an economy with <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/freemarket.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">freer markets</a> and held its first direct presidential election in 1991. Following a 1994 G-7 meeting in Naples, President Boris Yeltsin held meetings with G-7 member countries, in what became known as the P-8 (Political 8). In 1998, after urging from leaders including U.S. President Bill Clinton, Russia was added to the G-7 as a full member, creating a formal Group of Eight, or G-8.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"5\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nThe G-8 ended up being short-lived. In 2014, Russia was suspended from the group after the annexation of Crimea and tensions in Ukraine.
