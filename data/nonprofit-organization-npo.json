There are, however, key distinctions between the two types of enterprise.\n", "\nA key one is their purpose. As mentioned, nonprofits must offer some social benefit and provide goods or services. Not-for-profits need not have such an orientation and may exist simply to serve their membership rather than society at large.\n", "\nThe sections of the IRS's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/501c.asp\">501(c)</a> code that governs each of NPOs and NFPOs serve to further delineate their differences. Nonprofits operate under<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/501c3-organizations.asp\"> 501(c)(3)</a>, for \"corporations, funds or foundations that operate for religious, charitable, scientific, literary or educational purposes.\" NFPOs, by contrast, primarily do so under other sections, such as 501(c)(7), for \"recreational organizations.\" One classic example of an NFPO, then, is a sports club that's jointly owned by its members and sustained simply for their enjoyment.\n", "\nIn turn, the code sets out different tax treatment for NPOs and NFPOs. In general, both organization types are tax-exempt, as in the income they earn is not subject to tax.
