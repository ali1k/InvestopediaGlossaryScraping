Individual manual labor is often replaced by mechanized <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mass-production.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mass production</a>, and craftsmen are replaced by assembly lines. Characteristics of industrialization include<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economicgrowth.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> economic growth</a>, the more efficient division of labor, and the use of technological innovation to solve problems as opposed to dependency on conditions outside of human control.\n", "\nIndustrialization is most commonly associated with the European <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/industrial-revolution.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Industrial Revolution</a> of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Industrialization also occurred in the United States between the 1880s and the Great Depression. The onset of the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/112814/how-did-world-war-ii-impact-european-gdp.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Second World War</a> also led to a great deal of industrialization, which resulted in the growth and development of large urban centers and suburbs. Industrialization is an outgrowth of capitalism, and its effects on society are still <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/072815/what-are-some-drawbacks-industrialization.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">undetermined to some extent</a>; however, it has resulted in a lower birth rate and a higher average income.\n", "\nThe Industrial Revolution traces its roots to the late 18th century in Britain. Prior to the proliferation of industrial manufacturing facilities, fabrication and processing were generally carried out by hand in people's homes. The steam engine was a key invention, as it allowed for many different types of machinery. The growth of the metals and textiles industries allowed for the mass production of basic personal and commercial goods. As manufacturing activities grew, transportation, finance, and communications industries expanded to support the new production capacities.\n", "\nThe Industrial Revolution led to unprecedented expansion in wealth and financial well being for some. It also led to increased labor specialization and allowed cities to support larger populations, motivating a rapid demographic shift. People left rural areas in large numbers, seeking potential fortunes in budding industries. The revolution quickly spread beyond Britain, with manufacturing centers being established in continental Europe and the United States.\n", "\nWorld War II created an unprecedented demand for certain manufactured goods, leading to a buildup of productive capacity. After the war, reconstruction in Europe occurred alongside a massive population expansion in North America. This provided further catalysts that kept capacity utilization high and stimulated further growth of industrial activity. Innovation, specialization, and wealth creation were the causes and effects of industrialization in this period.\n", "\nThe late 20th century was noteworthy for rapid industrialization in other parts of the world, notably East Asia. The Asian Tigers (Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore) are well known for the economic growth that altered their countries/districs. China famously experienced its own industrial revolution after moving toward a more mixed economy and away from heavy <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/centrally-planned-economy.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">central planning</a>.\n", "\nDifferent strategies and methods of industrialization have been followed at different times and places with varying <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/033115/industrialization-good-economy.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">degrees of success</a>.\n", "\nThe Industrial Revolution in Europe and the United States initially took place under generally <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mercantilism.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mercantilist</a> and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/protectionism.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">protectionist</a> government policies that fostered the early growth of industry but was later associated with a more <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/laissezfaire.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">laissez-faire</a> or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/freemarket.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">free-market</a> approach that opened markets to foreign trade as an outlet for industrial output.\n", "\nIn the post Second World War era, developing nations across Latin America and Africa adopted a strategy of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/importsubstitutionindustrialization.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">import-substituting industrialization</a>, which involved protectionist barriers to trade coupled with direct subsidization or nationalization of domestic industries.\n", "\nNearly at the same time, parts of Europe and several East Asian economies pursued an alternative strategy of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/011416/exportled-growth-strategies-through-history.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">export-led growth</a>. This strategy emphasized the deliberate pursuit of foreign trade to build exporting industries, and partly depended on maintaining a weak currency to make exports more attractive to foreign buyers. In general, export-led growth has outperformed import-substituting industrialization.\n", "\nLastly, socialist nations of the 20th century repeatedly embarked on various deliberate, centrally planned programs of industrialization almost entirely independent of either domestic or foreign trade markets. These include the first and second five-year plans in the Soviet Union and the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/great-leap-forward.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Great Leap Forward</a> in China.\n", "\nWhile these efforts did re-orient the respective economies toward a more industrial base and an increase in output of industrial commodities, they were also accompanied by harsh government repression, deteriorating living and working conditions for workers, and even widespread starvation.\n"]}
