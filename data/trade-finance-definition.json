Trade finance makes it possible and easier for importers and exporters to transact business through trade.\u00a0Trade finance is an umbrella term meaning it covers many financial products that banks and companies utilize to make trade transactions feasible.\n", "\nThe function of trade finance is to introduce a\u00a0third-party to transactions to remove the payment risk and the supply risk. Trade finance provides the exporter with receivables or payment according to the agreement while the importer might be extended credit to fulfill the trade order.\u00a0\n", "\nThe parties involved in trade finance are numerous and can include:\n", "\nTrade financing is different than conventional financing or credit issuance. General financing is\u00a0used to manage solvency or liquidity, but trade financing may not necessarily indicate a buyer's lack of funds or liquidity. Instead, trade finance may be used to protect against international trade's unique inherent risks, such as currency fluctuations, political instability, issues of non-payment,\u00a0or the creditworthiness of one of the parties involved.\n", "\nBelow are a few of the financial instruments used in trade finance:\n", "\nAlthough international trade has been in existence for centuries, trade finance facilitates its advancement. The widespread use of trade finance has contributed to international trade growth.\n", "\nTrade finance can help reduce the risk associated with global trade by reconciling the divergent needs of an exporter and importer. Ideally, an\u00a0exporter would prefer the importer to pay\u00a0upfront for an export shipment to avoid\u00a0the risk that the importer takes\u00a0the shipment but\u00a0refuses to pay for\u00a0the goods. However, if the importer pays the exporter upfront, the exporter may accept the payment but refuse to ship the goods.\n", "\nA common solution to this problem is for the importer\u2019s bank to provide\u00a0a\u00a0letter of credit\u00a0to the exporter's\u00a0bank that\u00a0provides\u00a0for payment once the exporter presents documents that prove\u00a0the shipment occurred,\u00a0like a\u00a0bill of lading. The <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/letterofcredit.asp\">letter of credit</a>\u00a0guarantees that once the issuing bank receives\u00a0proof that the exporter shipped the goods and the terms of the agreement have been met, it will issue the payment to the\u00a0exporter.\n", "\nWith the letter of credit, the buyer's bank assumes the responsibility of paying the seller. The buyer's bank would have to ensure the buyer was financially viable enough to honor the transaction. Trade finance helps both importers and exporters build trust in dealing with each other and thus facilitating trade.\n", "\nBesides reducing the risk of nonpayment and non-receipt of goods, trade finance has become an important tool for companies to improve their efficiency and boost revenue.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/062013/bankers-acceptance-101.asp\">Trade finance</a> helps companies obtain financing to facilitate business but also it is an extension of credit in many cases. Trade finance allows companies to receive a cash payment based on accounts receivables in case of factoring. A letter of credit might help the importer and exporter to enter a trade transaction and reduce the risk of nonpayment or non-receipt of goods. As a result, cash flow is improved since the buyer's bank guarantees payment, and the importer knows the goods will be shipped.\n", "\nIn other words, trade finance ensures fewer delays in payments and in shipments allowing both importers and exporters to run their businesses and plan their cash flow more efficiently. Think of trade finance as using the shipment or trade of goods as collateral for financing the companies growth.\n", "\nTrade finance allows companies to increase their business and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/07/top-line-projection.asp\">revenue</a> through trade. For example, a U.S. company that can land a sale with a company overseas might not have the ability to produce the goods needed for the order.\n", "\nHowever, through export financing or help from private or governmental trade finance agencies, the exporter can complete the order.\u00a0As a result, the U.S. company gets new business that it might not have had without the creative financial solutions that trade finance provides.\n", "\nWithout trade financing, a company might fall behind on payments and lose a key customer or supplier that could have long-term ramifications for the company. Having options like revolving credit facilities and accounts receivables factoring can not only help companies transact internationally but also help them in times of financial difficulties.\n"]}
