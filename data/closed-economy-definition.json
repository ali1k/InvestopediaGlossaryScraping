The closed economy is therefore entirely self-sufficient, which\u00a0means\u00a0no imports\u00a0come into the country and\u00a0no exports\u00a0leave the country. The goal of a closed economy is to provide domestic consumers with everything they need from within the country's borders.\n", "\nMaintaining a closed economy is difficult in modern society because\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rawmaterials.asp\">raw materials</a>, such as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/crude-oil.asp\">crude oil</a>, play a vital role as inputs\u00a0to\u00a0final goods. Many countries do not have raw materials naturally and are forced to import\u00a0these resources. Closed economies are\u00a0counterintuitive to modern, liberal economic theory, which promotes the\u00a0opening\u00a0of domestic markets to international markets to capitalize on <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/comparativeadvantage.asp\">comparative advantages</a> and trade.\n", "\nBy specializing in\u00a0labor and allocating\u00a0resources to their most productive, efficient operations, companies and individuals can increase their\u00a0wealth.\n", "\nRecent<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/globalization.asp\"> globalization</a> implies that economies are tending to become more open to take advantage of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/insights/what-is-international-trade/\">international trade</a>. A good example of a raw material that is traded globally is petroleum. For instance, in 2017, according to <em>World'sTopExport.com</em>, an independent research and educational firm, the five biggest crude oil exporters\u00a0accounted for over <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"http://www.worldstopexports.com/worlds-top-oil-exports-country/\" rel=\"nofollow\">USD$841.1 billion</a> worth of exports.\n", "\nAccording to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, even the United States, the largest producer of oil in the world, imported roughly <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=727&amp;t=6\">10.4 million barrels</a> per day\u00a0in 2017, most of which comes from Canada, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Venezuela, and Iraq.\n", "\nA completely open economy runs the risk of becoming overly dependent on imports. Also, domestic producers may suffer because they cannot compete\u00a0at\u00a0low\u00a0international prices. Therefore, governments may use trade controls like\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tariff.asp\">tariffs</a>, subsidies, and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quota.asp\">quotas</a> to support domestic enterprises.\n", "\nAlthough\u00a0closed economies are rare, a government may close\u00a0off a specific industry from international competition. Some\u00a0oil-producing countries have a history of prohibiting foreign petroleum firms from doing business within their borders.\n", "\nIn practice, there are no completely closed economies. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NE.IMP.GNFS.KD?locations=BR\">Brazil imports the least amount of goods</a>\u2014when measured as a portion of the gross domestic product (GDP)\u2014in the world\u00a0and is the world's most closed economy. Brazilian companies face\u00a0challenges in terms of competitiveness, including exchange rate appreciation and defensive trade policies. In Brazil, only the largest and most efficient companies with\u00a0significant economies of scale can overcome barriers to export.\n"]}
