A write-up generally occurs if a company is being acquired and its assets and liabilities are restated to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fairmarketvalue.asp\">fair market value</a>, under the purchase method of M&amp;A accounting. It may also occur if the initial value of the asset was not recorded properly, or if an earlier write-down in its value was too large. An asset write-up is the opposite of a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/writedown.asp\">write-down</a>, and both are non-cash items.\n", "\nBecause a write-up impacts the balance sheet, the financial press does not report on more mundane instances of businesses initiating a write-up of asset values. In contrast, sizable write-downs do spark investor interest and make for better news cycles.\n", "\nWhereas a write-down is generally considered a red flag; a write-up is not considered a positive harbinger of future business prospects \u2014 since they're generally a one-time event.\n", "\nDuring an asset write-up, special treatment for intangible assets and tax effects are considered. With an asset write-up, the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/052915/what-are-some-examples-deferred-tax-liability.asp\">deferred tax liability</a> is generated from additional (future) depreciation expense.\n", "\nFor example, assume Company A is acquiring Company B for $100 million, at which point the book value of Company B's net assets was $60 million.
