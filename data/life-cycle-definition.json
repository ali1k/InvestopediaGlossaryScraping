The most common steps in the life cycle of a product include product development, market introduction, growth, maturity, and decline/stability.\n", "\nIt is important for investors to understand a company's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/product-life-cycle.asp\">product life cycle</a>. Firms that are predominately in the development phase will likely be characterized by small levels of sales and are more speculative in nature than firms in the growth or maturity phase. The five stages of a typical life cycle are:\n", "\nGrowth can still happen when a product hits maturity. A more mature firm with mature products may be more likely to issue dividends than firms in the other phases.\n", "\nBeyond product life cycles, finance and economics are full of other types of life cycles, which can often mean a series of overlapping themes. But most \"cycles\" are marked by their rise and fall patterns. For instance, it is common to hear of a business cycle, economic cycle or even an inventory cycle at a more micro level.\n", "\nThe idea of a cycle in a business context is borrowed from biology. In biology, a biological life cycle (or just life cycle when the biological context is clear) is a series of changes in the form that an organism undergoes, returning to the starting state. Extended to a business setting, the formation and eventual decline of an entity follows a similar path to biological applications. If we think of the economy and commerce as a \"living organization,\" adapting and transforming to its surroundings, we can find many biological analogies for business challenges, such as \"survival of the fittest.\"\n"]}
