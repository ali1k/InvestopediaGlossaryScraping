In most cases, the trader is expected to hit the best offer for buy orders or accept the best bid for sell orders.\u00a0The opposite order type,\u00a0a not-held order, provides traders with both time and price discretion to try and get a better fill.\n", "\nWhen filling a held order, traders have very little discretion in finding a price because time is scarce. Typically, they will be required to match the highest bid or lowest offer to facilitate an immediate transaction. For example, if the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bid-askspread.asp\">bid-ask market spread</a> in Apple Inc. is $182.50 / $182.70 and a trader receives a held order to purchase 100 shares, they\u00a0would place a buy order at the offer price of $182.70, which would be executed immediately under normal market conditions. Held orders are used by investors who need to change their exposure to a particular stock and want their order(s) executed without delay.\n", "\nMost investors want to get the best price possible, but there are two situations that held orders are ideal for:\n", "\nOne area where it is better to avoid using a held order is when you are dealing in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/illiquid.asp\">illiquid</a> stocks.\u00a0Suppose\u00a0a small-cap stock has a wide bid-ask market spread of $1.50 / $2.25. A trader who uses a held order is forced to pay the 33.3% spread ($0.75 / $2.25) to get prompt execution. In this instance, the trader may get a better price if they use discretion and sit at the top of the bid and incrementally increase the order price to entice a seller out of the woodwork. Of course, the 33.3% spread may be a reasonable price to pay if the trader is playing a breakout or closing a position that was a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fat-finger-error.asp\">fat finger error</a> to begin with.\n"]}
