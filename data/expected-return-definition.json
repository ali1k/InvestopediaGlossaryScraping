It is calculated by multiplying potential outcomes by the chances of them occurring and then totaling these results. Expected return calculations are a key piece of both business operations and financial theory, including in the well-known models of modern portfolio theory (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/modernportfoliotheory.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MPT</a>) or the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blackscholes.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">black-scholes</a> options pricing model.\n", "\nFor example, if an investment has a 50% chance of gaining 20% and a 50% chance of losing 10%, the expected return would be 5% = (50% x 20% + 50% x -10% = 5%).\n", "\nThe expected return is a tool used to determine whether an investment has a positive or negative average net outcome. The sum is calculated as the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expected-value.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">expected value</a> (EV)\u00a0of an investment given its\u00a0potential returns in different scenarios, as illustrated by\u00a0the following formula:\n", "\nwhere: \"i\" indicates each known return and its respective probability in the series\n", "\nThe expected return is usually based on historical data and is therefore not guaranteed into the future; however, it does often set reasonable expectations. Therefore, the expected return figure can be though of as a long-term weighted average of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/historical-returns.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">historical returns</a>.\n", "\nIn the formulation above, for instance, the 5% expected return may never be realized in the future, as the investment is inherently subject to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/systematicrisk.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">systematic</a> and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unsystematicrisk.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">unsystematic</a> risks. Systematic risk the danger to a market sector or the entire market whereas unsystematic risk applies to a specific company or industry.\n", "\nWhen considering individual investments or portfolios, a more formal equation for expected return of a financial investment is:\n", "\nwhere:\n", "\nIn essence, this formula states that the expected return in excess of the risk-free rate of return depends on the investment's beta, or relative volatility compared to the broader market.\n", "\nNote that it can be quite dangerous to make naive investment decisions based entirely on expected return calculations. Before making any investment decisions, one should always <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskreturntradeoff.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">review the risk characteristics</a> of investment opportunities to determine if the investments align with their portfolio goals.\n", "\nFor example, assume two hypothetical investments exist. Their annual performance results for the last five years are:\n", "\nBoth of these investments have expected returns of exactly 8%.\u00a0However,\u00a0when analyzing the risk of each, as defined by the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standarddeviation.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">standard deviation</a>, Analyst use standard deviation to reveal historical volatility in investments. Investment A is approximately five times riskier than Investment B. That is, Investment A has a standard deviation of 12.6% and Investment B has a standard deviation of 2.6%.\n", "\nIn addition to expected returns, wise investors should also consider the likelihood of a return\u00a0to better assess risk. After all, one can find instances where certain <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lottery.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lotteries</a> offer a positive expected return,\u00a0despite the very low chances of realizing that return.\n", "\nThe expected return does not just apply to a single <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">security</a> or asset. It can also be expanded to analyze\u00a0a portfolio containing many investments. If the expected return for each investment is known, the portfolio's overall <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/072715/how-do-i-calculate-expected-return-my-portfolio-excel.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">expected return</a> is a weighted average of the expected returns of its components.\n", "\nFor example, let's assume we have an investor interested in the tech sector. His portfolio contains the following stocks:\n", "\nWith a total portfolio value of $1 million the weights of Alphabet, Apple, and Amazon in the portfolio are 50%, 20%, and 30%, respectively.\n", "\nThus, the expected return of the total portfolio is 11.4%:\n", "\nExpected return and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standarddeviation.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">standard deviation</a> are two statistical measures that can be used to analyze a portfolio. The expected return of a portfolio is the anticipated amount of returns that a portfolio may generate, making it the mean (average) of the portfolio's possible return distribution; whereas the standard deviation of a portfolio measures the amount that the returns deviate from its mean, making it a proxy for the portfolio's risk.\n"]}
