Alternatively, if the spot price for a currency is 1.050 and the futures contract price is 1.110, the difference of 5.71% is the implied interest rate. In both of these examples, the implied rate is positive, which indicates that the market expects future borrowing rates to be higher than they are now.\n", "\nTo calculate the implied rate, take the ratio of the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forwardprice.asp\">forward price</a> over the spot price.
