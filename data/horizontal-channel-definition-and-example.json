A horizontal channel is also known as\u00a0a price range or sideways trend.\n", "\nA horizontal channel or sideways trend has the appearance of a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rectangle.asp\">rectangle</a> pattern. It consists\u00a0of at least four contact points. This is because it needs at least two lows to connect, as well as two highs. Buying and selling pressure is equal and the prevailing direction of price action is sideways. Horizontal channels form in periods of price consolidation. Price is framed out in a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tradingrange.asp\">trading range</a> by the pivot highs (resistance) and pivot lows (support). Trend lines are drawn on pivots to give a visual picture of price action. A new high in the price above the horizontal channel is a technical buy signal. A new low in price below the horizontal channel (or rectangle pattern) is a technical sell signal.\n", "\nThe horizontal channel is a familiar chart pattern found on every time frame. Buying and selling forces are similar in a horizontal channel\u00a0until a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/breakout.asp\">breakout</a> or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/breakdown.asp\">breakdown</a> occurs.\u00a0The horizontal\u00a0channel\u00a0is a powerful yet often overlooked chart pattern. It combines several forms of\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technicalanalysis.asp\">technical analysis</a>\u00a0to provide traders with precise points for entering and exiting trades, as well as controlling risk.\n", "\nThere are three types of channels: Channels that are angled up are called <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/ascendingchannel.asp\">ascending channels</a>. Channels that are angled down are called\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/descendingchannel.asp\">descending channels</a>. Ascending and descending channels are also called trend channels because the price is moving more dominantly in one direction.\n", "\nHorizontal channels provide a clear and systematic way to trade by providing buy and sell points.
