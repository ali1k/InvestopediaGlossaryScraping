With overdraft protection, a bank will cover a shortfall and charge for the service with an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/overdraft.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">overdraft</a> fee, or \u201ccourtesy fee,\u201d so the transaction goes through successfully.\n", "\nNSF (or insufficient funds) transactions are not covered by the bank and can be expensive and disruptive. Non-preauthorized transactions made with a check and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ach-transfers-what-are-they-and-how-do-they-work-4590120\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">automated clearing house (ACH) withdrawals</a> are returned unpaid, a practice known as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bouncedcheck.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bouncing</a>. Most banks charge hefty overdraft and NSF fees (between $30 and $35, on average) for accounts that do not have sufficient funds. What's more, not only can the bank refuse payment and charge the account holder an NSF fee, but a penalty or fee may also be charged by the merchant for the failed transaction.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/071114/what-are-pros-and-cons-overdraft-protection.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Customers who choose overdraft protection</a> can link their checking accounts to credit cards, savings accounts, or other lines of credit to avoid triggering an overdraft or NSF fee. This amounts to a preapproved loan\u00a0or transfer that kicks in automatically when a customer writes a check, makes a wire transfer, swipes a debit card, or asks an ATM for a sum of\u00a0money in excess of an account\u2019s balance.\n", "\nTypically, an overdraft protection\u00a0agreement kicks in when an account holder withdraws more than the current balance\u00a0in a checking account. In that case, the individual or business with a linked account is charged a transfer fee to facilitate moving funds to cover the shortfall. The account holder may be also be charged an additional\u00a0fee every month that\u00a0overdraft protection is used\u00a0or a fixed monthly fee for continuous protection.\n", "\nOverdraft protection, sometimes called\u00a0\u201ccash reserve checking<em>,</em>\u201d\u00a0is most frequently\u00a0used as a cushion for checking accounts,\u00a0but it also can be applied to savings accounts. Banks have the right to reject loans or fund transfers if they\u00a0fall\u00a0outside the rules\u00a0of the overdraft protection\u00a0agreement.\n", "\nIn the absence of overdraft protection, it is not uncommon for banks to charge multiple overdraft or NSF fees per day, such as when a consumer makes successive purchases without realizing that the amount in their account is insufficient to pay for the purchases. Many banks also charge an extended overdraft fee if a checking account goes negative for more than a few days. It\u2019s important to note that even if you have overdraft protection, banks will still charge this\u00a0additional fee.\n", "\nA renter\u00a0with overdraft protection and a linked account writes an $800 check to cover the monthly rent on an\u00a0account\u00a0that only has\u00a0$650 in it. Instead of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/08/overdraft-protection.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bouncing the check due to insufficient funds</a>, the renter\u2019s overdraft protection kicks in when the check is cashed.\n", "\nThe\u00a0bank charges\u00a0a transfer\u00a0fee of $15\u00a0for approving a debit transaction that exceeds available funds. The\u00a0renter\u00a0will now have a\u00a0balance of $635 ($650 -\u00a0$15)\u00a0and has to pay off $800 through a linked credit card, line of credit, or savings account.\n", "\nOverdraft protection lines of credit can range from $250 to $5,000 and above and, of course, come with an interest rate. If a credit card is used, it should be noted that the amount is\u00a0treated as a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashadvance.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cash advance</a>. This has no grace period\u00a0and usually incurs a high interest rate, as well as\u00a0a cash advance fee (usually a $10 flat fee or 5% of the advance, whichever is greater), <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/071114/whats-better-way-borrow-money-overdraft-or-credit-cards.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">making it a fairly expensive form of overdraft protection</a>. A linked savings account is probably the least expensive solution, but it must hold enough money to cover the needed funds.\n", "\nIn 2019, the most common overdraft fee was $35, with an average of $33.36, according to a BankRate.com survey of 10 banks and thrifts in 25 large U.S. markets.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"6\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff Credit unions tend to charge less, an average of $26, according to a 2019 NerdWallet.com study.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"5\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff Some banks, such as online banks, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/121114/top-checking-accounts-no-overdraft-fees.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">do not charge overdraft fees</a>.\n", "\nMany consider overdraft fees abusive, but little has been done about them because, as of mid-2018, CFPB Acting Director Mick Mulvaney halted rule-making plans to reform them.
