The EBITDA/EV ratio may be preferred over other measures of return because it is normalized for differences between companies. Using EBITDA normalizes for differences in capital structure, taxation, and fixed asset accounting. The enterprise value (EV) also normalizes for differences in a company's capital structure.\n", "\nEBITDA/EV is a comparables analysis method that seeks to value similar companies using the same financial metrics. While computing the\u00a0EBITDA/EV ratio is more complicated than other return measures, it is sometimes preferred because it provides a normalized ratio for comparing the operations of different companies.\n", "\nAn analyst using EBITDA/EV assumes that a particular ratio is applicable and can be applied to various companies operating within the same line of business or industry. In other words, the theory is that when firms are comparable, this <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/multiplesapproach.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">multiples approach</a> can be used to determine the value of one firm based on the value of another. Thus, EBITDA/EV is commonly used to compare companies within an industry.\n", "\nThis is a modification of the ratio of operating and non-operating profits compared to the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketvalue.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">market value</a> of a company's equity plus its debt. Since EBITDA is often considered a proxy for cash income, the metric is used as a measure of a company's cash return on investment.\n", "\n\"<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebitda.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">EBITDA</a>\" is an acronym that stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. However, the measure is not based on the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).\n", "\nIn April 2016, the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) stated non-GAAP measures such as EBITDA would be a focal point for the agency to ensure that companies are not presenting results in a misleading manner. If EBITDA is shown, the SEC advises that the company should reconcile the metric to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/netincome.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">net income</a>. This should assist investors by providing information on how the figure is calculated.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/enterprisevalue.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Enterprise value</a> (EV) is a measure of the economic value of a company. It is frequently used to determine the value of the business if it is acquired. It is considered to be a better valuation measure than <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">market capitalization</a>, since the latter factors in only a business' equity without regard to the debt.\n", "\nEV is calculated as the market capitalization plus debt, preferred stock, and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/minorityinterest.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">minority interest</a>, minus cash. An entity purchasing a company would have to pay the value of the equity and assume the debt, but the money would reduce the price paid.\n", "\nThe EBITDA/EV uses the cash flows of a business to evaluate the value of a company.When the EBITDA is compared to enterprise revenue, an investor can tell if a business has cash flow issues. A business with healthy cash flow will have a high value. Banks also look at EBITDA since it is an indicator on the capacity of the enterprise to pay the debt service and repay the principal of any new debt incurred.\n", "\nFor example, Wal-Mart Inc.'s EBITDA for the fiscal year 2020, was $31.55 billion. Its enterprise value was $445.77 billion during this period. This works out to an EBITDA/EV multiple of 0.07077 or 7.08%.\n", "\nThe reciprocate multiple <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ev-ebitda.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">EV/EBITDA</a> is used to measure the value of a company.\n"]}
