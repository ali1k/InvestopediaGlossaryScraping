It occurs whenever there is a change of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/national-currency.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">national currency</a>: The current form or forms of money is pulled from circulation and retired, often to be replaced with new notes or coins. Sometimes, a country completely replaces the old currency with new currency.\n", "\nRemoving the legal tender status of a unit of currency is a drastic intervention into an economy because it directly affects the medium of exchange used in all economic transactions. It can help stabilize existing problems, or it can cause chaos in an economy, especially if undertaken suddenly or without warning. That said, demonetization is undertaken by nations for a number of reasons.\n", "\nDemonetization has been used to stabilize the value of a currency or combat <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">inflation</a>. The Coinage Act of 1873 demonetized <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/silver.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">silver</a> as the legal tender of the United States, in favor of fully adopting the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/goldstandard.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">gold standard</a>, in order to stave off disruptive inflation as large new silver deposits were discovered in the American West. Several coins, including a two-cent piece, three-cent piece, and half-dime were discontinued. The withdrawal of silver from the economy resulted in a contraction of the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/moneysupply.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">money supply</a>, which contributed to a recession throughout the country. In response to the recession and political pressure from farmers and from silver miners and refiners, the Bland-Allison Act remonetized silver as legal tender in 1878.\n", "\nIn a more modern example, the Zimbabwean government demonetized its dollar in 2015 as a way to combat the country\u2019s hyperinflation, which was recorded at <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/09/zimbabwe\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">231,000,000 percent</a>.

An example of demonetization for trade purposes occurred when the nations of the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/europeanunion.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">European Union</a> officially began to use the<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/euro.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> euro</a> as their everyday currencies in 2002. When the\u00a0physical euro bills and coins were introduced, the old national currencies, such as the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deutschmark.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">German mark</a>, the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/franc-f.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">French franc</a>, and the Italian lira were demonetized. However, these varied currencies remained convertible into Euros at <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"5\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixedexchangerate.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fixed exchange rates</a> for a while to assure a smooth transition.\n", "\nLastly, demonetization has been tried as a tool to modernize a cash-dependent developing economy and to combat corruption and crime (counterfeiting, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxevasion.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tax evasion</a>). In 2016, the Indian government decided to demonetize the 500- and 1000- rupee notes, the two biggest denominations in its currency system; these notes accounted for 86 percent of the country\u2019s circulating cash. With little warning, India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced to the citizenry on Nov. 8, 2016, that those notes were worthless, effective immediately \u2013 and they had until the end of the year to deposit or exchange them for newly introduced 2000 rupee and 500 rupee bills.\n", "\nChaos ensued in the cash-dependent economy (some 78 percent of all Indian customer transactions are in cash), as long, snaking lines formed outside <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/atm.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ATMs</a> and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bank.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">banks</a>, which had to shut down for a day. The new rupee notes have different specifications, including size and thickness, requiring re-calibration of ATMs: only 60 percent of the country\u2019s 200,000 ATMs were operational. Even those dispensing bills of lower denominations faced shortages. The government\u2019s restriction on daily withdrawal amounts added to the misery, though a waiver on <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/transaction-fees.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">transaction fees</a> did help a bit.\n", "\nSmall businesses and households struggled to find cash and reports of daily wage workers not receiving their dues surfaced. The rupee fell sharply against the dollar.\u00a0\n", "\nThe government\u2019s goal (and rationale for the abrupt announcement) was to combat India's thriving <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underground-economy.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">underground economy</a> on several fronts: eradicate counterfeit currency, fight tax evasion (only 1 percent of the population pays taxes), eliminate <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/black-money.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">black money</a> gained from <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/moneylaundering.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">money laundering</a> and terrorist financing activities, and to promote a cashless economy. Individuals and entities with huge sums of black money gotten from parallel cash systems were forced to take their large-denomination notes to a bank, which was by law required to acquire <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxes.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tax</a> information on them. If the owner could not provide proof of making any tax payments on the cash, a penalty of 200 percent of the owed amount was imposed.\n"]}
