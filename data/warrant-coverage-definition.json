Warrants, similar to options, allow investors to acquire shares at a designated price.\n", "\nWarrant coverage agreements are designed to sweeten the deal for an investor because the agreement <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leverage.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">leverages</a> their investment and increase their return if the value of the company increases as hoped.\n", "\nWarrant coverage assures investors that they can increase their share of ownership in the company should circumstances rapidly improve. This is done by means of issuing warrants as a condition of the investors' participation.\n", "\nA <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/warrant.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">warrant</a> is a type of derivative which gives the holder the right to buy the underlying stock at a specified price before or at <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maturity.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">maturity</a>. The warrant does\u00a0not\u00a0obligate\u00a0the holder to purchase the underlying stock. A warrant coverage is simply the agreement to issue stocks to cover the possible future execution of the warrant instrument.\n", "\nWarrants are similar to an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">option</a> but have three main exceptions. First, they originate from a company, not from traders. Second, warrants are dilutive to the underlying stock. When the holder exercises a warrant, the company issues new stock, rather than delivering existing stock. Finally, they can be attached to other securities, most notably <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bonds</a>, giving the holder the right to purchase shares of stock, as well.\n", "\nWhile warrants come in both <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/putoption.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">put</a> and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">call</a> varieties, for use in warrant coverage they typically are the latter.\n", "\nFor example, an investor purchases 1,000,000 shares of stock at a price of $5 per share, totaling a $5,000,000 investment. The company grants a 20% warrant coverage, and issues to the investor $1,000,000 in warrants. In technical terms, the company guarantees 200,000 additional shares at an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exerciseprice.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">exercise price</a> of $5 per share.\n", "\nIssuing\u00a0warrants do not give the investor any additional <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/downside-protection.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">downside protection</a>, as the underlying shares would be issued at the same price they paid for the stock. However, the warrant coverage would give the investor additional <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/upside.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">upside</a>,\u00a0if the company goes public or is sold at a price above $5 per share.\n", "\nWarrant coverage allows and possibly encourages the holder to participate in the success of the company, manifested in the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/appreciation.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">appreciation</a> of the price of the underlying stock.\n", "\nIt also gives the holder protection against the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dilution.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">dilutive</a> effects of any future new share offerings. This future protection is ironic because the exercise of the warrant is dilutive itself to\u00a0the existing shares.\n", "\nOne reason a company might issue warrants is to attract more <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">capital</a>. For example, if it cannot issue bonds at a satisfactory rate or amount, warrants attached to a\u00a0bond\u00a0can make them more attractive to investors. Often warrants are seen as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/speculation.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">speculative</a>.\n", "\nOne of the best examples of warrant coverage took place during the financial crisis of 2008.\u00a0Wall Street giant, Goldman Sachs, needed to increase capital and raise the perception of its financial health. Goldman sold $5 billion of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/preferredstock.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">preferred stock</a> to Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. The warrants to purchase $5 billion of common stock with a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strikeprice.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">strike price</a> of $115 per share had a five-year maturity. Goldman's shares were trading near $129 at that time, giving Berkshire an instant, although not guaranteed, profit.\n"]}
