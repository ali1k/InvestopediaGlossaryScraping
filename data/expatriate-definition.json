An expatriate can also be an individual who has relinquished citizenship in their home country to become a citizen of another.\n", "\nAn expatriate is a migrant worker who is a professional or skilled worker in his or her profession. The worker takes a position outside his/her home country, either independently or as a work assignment scheduled by the employer, which can be a company, university, government, or non-governmental organization.If your employer sends you from your job in its Silicon Valley office to work for an extended period in its Toronto office, you would be considered an expatriate or \"expat\" after you arrive in Toronto.\n", "\nExpats usually earn more than they would at home, and more than local employees. In addition to salary, businesses sometimes give their expatriate employees benefits such as relocation assistance and housing allowance.\n", "\nLiving as an expatriate can be exciting and present an excellent opportunity for career advancement and global business exposure, but it can also be an emotionally difficult transition that involves separation from friends and family while adjusting to an unfamiliar culture and work environment. Hence, the reason behind the higher compensation offered to these migrant workers.\n", "\nMuch expatriation occurs during retirement.

But it can also be tricky to navigate taxes, long-stay visas, and the language and cultural differences experienced when settling down in other countries.\n", "\nA common choice presented to a retiree expat is between permanent residency and dual citizenship. Note that neither dual citizenship nor residency gets you out of filing a U.S.\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxreturn.asp\">tax return</a>\u00a0every year.

For 2019, this amount is $105,900. An expat that earns, say $180,000, from his job in a foreign country that is tax-free will only need to pay U.S. federal income tax on $180,000 - $105,900 = $74,100.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\"></span>\n", "\nThe FEIE does not apply to rental income or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investmentincome.asp\">investment income</a>.

These can range from new experiences and adventure to more practical considerations like a lower cost of living or being closer to extended family abroad. Depending on where you settle, you may also get government perks like free healthcare and education and more favorable taxation.\n", "\nThere are also some potential drawbacks. Regarding taxation, unless you fully relinquish your American citizenship, you will still need to file tax returns each year and may need to pay taxes to Uncle Sam, even on income earned in your new country.\n", "\nYou'll also be a long way from home, potentially. This can make seeing friends and family more difficult, and time zone differences can also interfere with finding a good time to link up by phone or video chat.
