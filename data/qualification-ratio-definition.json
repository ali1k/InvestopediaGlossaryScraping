Used in the underwriting process, a qualification ratio calculates how likely it would be for a borrower to repay a loan.\n", "\nLenders normally use one of two qualification ratios in their underwriting process. The first is the monthly <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dti.asp\">debt-to-income ratio</a> (DTI) while the second one is called the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/back-endratio.asp\">back-end ratio</a>, which calculates the monthly debt payment to income. Qualification ratios also determine the terms of any credit application including repayment terms and interest rate.\n", "\nConsumer credit applications provide lenders with a window into the personal and financial situation of applicants. Consumers are required to provide information such as their name, address, and financial information on these applications. This information includes employment information, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/income.asp\">income</a>, and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debt.asp\">debts</a>. Lenders use this information in the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underwriting.asp\">underwriting</a> process to determine whether or not to approve a consumer's credit application for most credit products, especially loans and mortgages.\n", "\nA borrower's housing expenses alone, which include <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/homeowners-insurance.asp\">homeowners insurance</a>, taxes, utilities, and neighborhood or association fees, cannot exceed 28% of a borrower's\u00a0monthly <a class=\"pseudoStyle\" data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/grossincome.asp\">gross income</a>.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"5\"></span> Another qualification ratio, the borrower\u2019s DTI, includes housing expenses plus debt, and generally cannot\u00a0exceed 36% of monthly gross income.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\"></span>\n", "\nHigher ratios indicate an increased risk of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/default2.asp\">default</a>. But some lenders may accept higher ratios in exchange for certain factors, such as substantial <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/down_payment.asp\">down payments</a>, sizable savings, and favorable <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit_score.asp\">credit scores</a>. For example, a lender may offer a mortgage to a borrower with a high front-end ratio if they pay half of the purchase price as a down payment.\n", "\nAs mentioned above, lenders generally use one of two qualification ratios to determine the likelihood of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/repayment.asp\">repayment</a>. This is based on the information provided by the applicant as well as their <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditreport.asp\">credit report</a>. The first ratio involves the applicant's total monthly debt to total monthly income while the other calculates the total monthly debt payments versus the total monthly income. These ratios take\u00a0the total annual <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/household_income.asp\">income of a household</a> and divide it by 12. Banks generally use the lower of the two numbers to determine how large a loan to offer you.\n", "\nQualification ratios are not rigid. Excellent <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-history.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">credit history</a> often mitigates a poor ratio, for example. In addition, some borrowers who do not meet the standard qualifying ratios take advantage of special mortgage programs offered by some banks. The added risk of default by these borrowers means that they generally pay higher <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">interest rates</a> versus mortgages that meet\u00a0standard qualifying ratios.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditcard.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Credit card</a> debt also counts toward your back-end ratio, but this is much more complicated. Lenders used to apply the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/minimum-monthly-payment.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">minimum payment</a> on a credit card balance and call that monthly debt. But that system wasn't fair to credit card users who paid\u00a0off their balance in full every month and used credit cards mainly for convenience and reward points.\n", "\nMost lenders now look at the borrower\u2019s total <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/revolvingcredit.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">revolving balance</a> and apply 5% of the total as monthly debt. Say\u00a0you carry $10,000 in credit card debt. In this case, the bank tacks on $500 in monthly debt to your back-end ratio.\u00a0\n", "\nHere's a hypothetical example to show how qualification ratios work. Let's say you and your spouse earn a combined $96,000 a year, your family's\u00a0gross income would amount to $8,000 a month. Multiply $8,000 by the 28% threshold required by most lenders and you\u2019ll get the minimum housing expense that you can afford, which lenders call the front, or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/front-endratio.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">front-end ratio</a>. In this case, your family would be eligible for a loan if total monthly housing expenses do not exceed $2,240. Note this expense figure\u00a0includes property taxes, homeowner\u2019s insurance, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortgage-insurance.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">private mortgage insurance</a> (PMI), and charges such as\u00a0condo fees.\u00a0\n", "\nNow let's take a look at the back-end ratio using the same example. In this case, take the $8,000 monthly income and multiply it by the minimum threshold of 36%. This is effectively your debt-to-income ratio, and you'll get a figure of $2,880. Next, deduct any monthly debt payments from that $2,280. Let's assume these consist of a $300 monthly car payment and a $400 monthly <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/student-loans-4689727\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">student loan</a> payment. This\u00a0leaves you with $2,180 for housing expenses. Note that this figure is typically\u00a0lower than the front-end ratio.\n"]}
