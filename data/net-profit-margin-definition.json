is one of the most important indicators of a company's financial health. By tracking increases and decreases in its net profit margin, a company can assess whether current practices are working and forecast profits based on revenues. Because companies express\u00a0net profit margin\u00a0as a percentage rather than a dollar amount, it is possible to compare the profitability of two or more businesses regardless of size.\n", "\nInvestors can assess if a company's management is generating enough profit from its sales and whether operating costs and overhead costs are being contained. For example, a company can have growing revenue, but if its operating costs are increasing at a faster rate than revenue, its net profit margin will shrink. Ideally, investors want to see a track record of expanding margins, meaning that the net profit margin is rising over time.\n", "\nMost publicly traded companies report their net profit margins both quarterly during <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earnings.asp\">earnings</a> releases and in their <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/annualreport.asp\">annual reports</a>. Companies that can expand their net margins over time are generally rewarded with share price growth, as share price growth is typically highly correlated with earnings growth.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gross_profit_margin.asp\">Gross profit margin</a>\u00a0is the\u00a0proportion of money left over from revenues after accounting for the\u00a0cost of goods sold\u00a0(COGS).

Gross margin is helpful in determining how much profit is generated from the production of a company's goods because it excludes other items such as overhead from the corporate office, taxes, and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interest.asp\">interest</a> on a debt.\n", "\nNet profit margin, on the other hand, is the percentage of profit generated from revenue after accounting for all expenses, costs, and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashflow.asp\">cash flow</a> items.\n", "\nNet profit margin can be influenced by one-off items such as the sale of an asset, which would temporarily boost profits.

A 56%\u00a0profit margin indicates the company earns 56 cents\u00a0in profit for every dollar it collects.\n", "\nLet's take a look at another hypothetical example, using the made-up Jazz Music Shop's FY 2025 income statement.\n", "\nHere, we can gather all of the information we need to plug into the net profit margin equation.

If Jazz Music Shop also had to pay interest and taxes, that too would have been deducted from revenues.\n", "\nThe net profit margin is calculated by taking the ratio of net income to revenue. Net profit margin is calculated as follows:\n", "\nBelow is a portion of the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/pdfs/Q1_FY19_Consolidated_Financial_Statements.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">income statement</a> for Apple Inc. as reported for the quarter ending on Dec. 29, 2018:\n", "\nA\u00a0net profit margin of 23.7% means\u00a0that for every dollar generated by Apple\u00a0in sales, the company kept\u00a0just shy of $0.24\u00a0as profit.\n", "\n<em>Source</em>: Apple, Inc.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\"></span>\n", "\nThe net margin is perhaps the most important measure of a company's overall profitability. It is the ratio of net profits to\u00a0revenues\u00a0for a company or business segment. Expressed as a percentage, the net profit\u00a0margin\u00a0shows how much profit is generated from every $1 in sales, after accounting for all business expenses involved in earning those revenues. Larger profit margins mean that more of every dollar in sales is kept as profit.\n", "\nWhen a company's net margin exceeds the average for its industry, it is said to have a\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/competitive_advantage.asp\">competitive advantage</a>, meaning it is more successful than other companies that have similar operations.

Cutting too many costs can also lead to undesirable outcomes, including losing skilled workers, shifting to inferior materials, or other losses in quality. Cutting advertising budgets may also harm sales.\n", "\nTo reduce the cost of production without sacrificing quality, the best option for many businesses is expansion.\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/insights/what-are-economies-of-scale/\">Economies of scale</a>\u00a0refer to the idea that larger companies tend to be more profitable. A large business's increased level of production means that the cost of each item is reduced in several ways. For example, raw materials purchased in bulk are often discounted by wholesalers.\n", "\nNet profit margin takes into account all costs involved in a sale, making it the most comprehensive and conservative measure of profitability. Gross margin, on the other hand, simply looks at the costs of goods sold (COGS) and ignores things such as overhead, fixed costs, interest expenses, and taxes. Operating margin further takes into account all operating costs but still excludes any non-operating costs.\n", "\nHigh-profit margin sectors typically include those in the services industry, as there are fewer assets involved in production than an assembly line. Similarly, software or gaming companies may invest initially while developing a particular software/game and cash in big later by simply selling millions of copies with very few expenses. Luxury goods and high-end accessories also often operate on high-profit potential and low sales.\n", "\nOperations-intensive businesses such as transportation, which may have to deal with fluctuating fuel prices, drivers\u2019 perks and retention, and vehicle maintenance, usually have lower profit margins. Agriculture-based ventures, too, usually have low-profit margins, owing to weather uncertainty, high <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inventory.asp\">inventory</a>, operational overheads, need for farming and storage space, and resource-intensive activities.\n", "\nAutomobiles also have low-profit margins, as profits and sales are limited by intense competition, uncertain consumer demand, and high operational expenses involved in developing dealership networks and logistics.\n"]}
