These facilities are often electronic systems controlled by approved market operators or larger <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investmentbank.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">investment banks</a>. Traders usually submit orders electronically, where a matching software engine pairs buyers with sellers.\n", "\nMTFs provide <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/retailinvestor.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">retail investors</a> and investment firms with an alternative to traditional exchanges. Before their introduction, investors had to rely on national securities exchanges such as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/euronext.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Euronext</a> or the London Stock Exchange (LSE).\n", "\nMTFs have fewer restrictions surrounding the admittance of financial instruments for trading, allowing participants to exchange more exotic assets and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otc.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">over-the-counter</a> (OTC) products. For example, the LMAX Exchange offers spot foreign exchange and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/preciousmetal.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">precious metals</a> trading.\n", "\nFaster transaction speeds, lower costs and trading incentives have helped MTFs become increasingly popular in Europe, although the NASDAQ OMX Europe was closed in 2010 as MTFs face intense competition with each other and established <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exchange.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">exchanges</a>.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff The introduction of MTFs has led to greater fragmentation in the financial markets since single securities may now list across multiple venues.

ATS are regulated as broker-dealers rather than exchanges in most cases, but must still be approved by the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) and meet certain restrictions.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nIn recent years, the SEC has intensified its enforcement activities surrounding ATS in a move that could lead to stricter MTF regulation in Europe.
