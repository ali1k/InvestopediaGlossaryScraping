The FDA has developed rules regarding the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/clinical-trials.asp\">clinical trials</a> that must be done on all new medications. Pharmaceutical companies must test drugs through four phases of clinical trials before they can be marketed to individuals.\n", "\nAccording to the FDA, the agency holds responsibility for monitoring the safe consumption of medical products, food, and tobacco items worth more than $2.6 trillion. In fiscal 2020, the budget for the FDA was approximately $3.6 billion.\n", "\nThe FDA is relevant for investors specifically in regards to biotech and pharmaceutical companies. FDA approval can be crucial to companies that are heavily involved in developing new drugs. Without the agency\u2019s approval, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/regulated-market.asp\">regulated products</a>\u00a0under the FDA's purview cannot be released for sale in the United States.\n", "\nCompanies that are focused on the development and sale of new drugs can be left without key products to drive their revenue if their products fail to receive approvals. The influence the FDA wields regarding drug testing can affect the stock market. The release of test data might be seen by investors as a measure for future growth for companies that manufacture and market drugs.\n", "\nThe FDA is responsible for inspecting and reviewing production facilities that make items that are regulated by the agency. This includes\u00a0but is not limited to\u00a0vaccine and drug manufacturers, blood banks, food processing facilities, dairy farms, animal feed processors, and compounding pharmacies.\n", "\nThe agency also inspects facilities where testing on animals and clinical trials are conducted. Inspections may be regularly scheduled visits to facilities already in use.\n", "\nImported regulated products must also be inspected by the FDA when they arrive at the border of the country. The agency publishes announcements of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/product_recall.asp\">product recalls</a> in collaboration with companies and local partners.\n", "\nThe agency conducts preapproval inspections for companies that applied to market new products. Inspections may be launched \u201cfor cause\u201d if there is an issue reported at a facility. Such recalls can be the result of undeclared ingredients in the contents, which can pose risks for consumers with allergies. The contamination of products or the failure to handle the product according to safety parameters can also be the cause for recalls.\u00a0\n"]}
