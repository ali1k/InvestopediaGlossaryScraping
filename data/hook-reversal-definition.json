The pattern occurs when a\u00a0candlestick has a higher low and a lower high than\u00a0the previous session's candlestick. This pattern differs from <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bullishengulfingpattern.asp\">engulfing</a> patterns in\u00a0that the size difference\u00a0between the first and second bar's body can be relatively\u00a0small.\n", "\nHook reversal patterns are popular candlestick patterns among <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/active-trading.asp\">active traders</a> since they occur fairly frequently and are relatively easy to spot since the second candlestick changes to the opposite\u00a0color. The strength and reliability of the pattern often depends on the strength of the uptrend or downtrend that preceded it, and most traders use other candlestick patterns, chart patterns, or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technicalindicator.asp\">technical indicators</a> as confirmation of a reversal. After all, the pattern occurs relatively frequently, which leads to many false positives that must be discounted.\n", "\nHook reversal patterns are often classified as a type of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bullishharami.asp\">harami</a> or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bullishengulfingpattern.asp\">engulfing</a> because the real body of the second candle forms within the body of the previous candle. They are also similar to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/darkcloud.asp\">dark cloud cover</a> patterns where both real bodies are similar length.\u00a0The key difference is that hook reversal patterns only require a small size difference, whereas harami and engulfing patterns emphasize large differences in sizes between candlesticks. In general, harami and engulfings tend to be less common and more accurate than hook reversal patterns in predicting a trend reversal.\n", "\nHook reversal patterns can be either bullish or bearish reversal patterns:\n", "\nTraders should set <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/take-profitorder.asp\">take-profit</a> and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stop-lossorder.asp\">stop-loss</a> points for these reversals based on other technical indicators or chart patterns since hook reversals only indicate that a potential reversal is about to take place without providing insight into the magnitude of the reversal.\n"]}
