The association is commonly known as Ginnie Mae and is abbreviated to GNMA. Ginnie Mae's assurance allows <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortgage.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mortgage</a> lenders to obtain a better price for MBSs in the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalmarkets.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">capital markets</a>.\n", "\nThe Government National Mortgage Association was established in 1968 as part of the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/us-department-housing-urban-development-hud.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">U.S Department of Housing and Urban Development</a> (HUD) to promote affordable homeownership.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff Ginnie Mae doesn't create or advance mortgages but guarantees them for single and multifamily homes. Since these <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/loan.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">loans</a> are backed by the government, homeowners are able to secure lower <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">interest rates</a>, therefore lowering their borrowing costs.\n", "\nIt was the first organization to create and guarantee mortgage-backed securities in 1970 and has continued to back these instruments ever since. Securities were first sold on the international market on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange in 1983.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff Ginnie Mae essentially stands a few steps behind the mortgage market neither issuing, selling, or buying pass-through mortgage-backed securities, nor purchasing mortgage loans. Instead,\u00a0approved private <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lender.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lenders</a> originate eligible loans, pool them into <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">securities</a>, and issue mortgage-backed securities\u00a0guaranteed by Ginnie Mae.\u00a0According to the association's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www.ginniemae.gov/pages/default.aspx\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">website</a>, Ginnie Mae's MBS portfolio balance is worth $2.1 trillion.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nBy doing this, Ginnie\u00a0Mae\u00a0guarantees the timely payment of principal and interest from approved issuers\u2014such as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortgagebanker.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mortgage bankers</a>, savings and loans, and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commercialbank.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">commercial banks</a>\u2014of qualifying loans. An investor in a GNMA security doesn't know who the underlying issuer of the mortgages is, but merely that the security is guaranteed by Ginnie Mae. This means it is backed by the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/full-faith-credit.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">full faith and credit</a> of the U.S. government, just like the instruments issued by the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/ustreasury.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">U.S.Treasury</a>.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"5\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff The GNMA guarantee means that Investors with shares in Ginnie\u00a0Mae funds never have to worry about the impact of late payments or mortgage defaults on their investment. When mortgage borrowers fail to make a payment, Ginnie Mae steps in to honor those missed payments.\u00a0\n", "\nGinnie Mae's efforts serve to expand the pool of homeowners by mostly aiding lending to homeowners who are traditionally underserved in the mortgage market. Most mortgages securitized as Ginnie Mae MBSs are insured by the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federal-housing-administration.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Federal Housing Administration</a> (FHA), which typically insures mortgages to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/firsttimehomebuyer.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">first-time home buyers</a> and low-income borrowers. Other frequent beneficiaries of Ginnie Mae\u00a0guarantees are securities made up of mortgages insured by the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/veterans-administration.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Veterans Administration</a> (VA) and the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rhs.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rural Housing Service</a> (RHS).\u00a0\n", "\nAs a government guaranteeing agency, there are some things that Ginnie Mae doesn't do. As noted above, the agency doesn't originate any loans itself and doesn't provide any financing for mortgage issuers. The GNMA also doesn't provide any insurance to lenders against any credit risks that stem from borrowers. Furthermore, Ginnie Mae doesn't set any standards for loan issuers such as underwriting or credit standards.\n", "\nThere are several organizations that are similar to Ginnie Mae, notably its cousins <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/freddiemac.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Freddie Mac</a>, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/fannie-mae-loans/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fannie Mae</a>, and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/salliemae.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sallie Mae</a>. Like Ginnie Mae, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae involve mortgage and home loans, while Sallie Mae deals primarily with education loans. The key difference between Ginnie Mae and the others is that Ginnie Mae is a federally-owned corporation. The others are <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gse.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">government-sponsored enterprises</a> (GSEs) or federally chartered corporations that are owned by private shareholders.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"6\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\u00a0\n", "\nWhere Ginnie Mae guarantees only securities that comprise mortgages guaranteed by federal agencies, such as the FHA and VA, its relatives may back securities whose mortgages are not insured by those federal bodies. Fannie Mae also has its own <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/portfolio.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">portfolio</a>, commonly referred to as a retained portfolio, which invests in its own and other institutions' mortgage-backed securities.\u00a0\n", "\nThe GNMA is also ostensibly the only Mae or Mac backed by the full faith and credit of the federal government. However, In the latter half of 2008, during the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/housing_bubble.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">housing crisis</a>, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were taken over by the government via a\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/conservatorship.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">conservatorship</a>\u00a0of the Federal Housing Finance Committee.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"7\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff Both were bailed out to the tune of over $190 billion as of 2019, which saved them from collapse.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"8\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\u00a0Some argue that the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bailout.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bailout</a> all but erased Ginnie Mae's distinction as the only federal agency guaranteeing mortgage securities that enjoy government protection against failure.\n"]}
