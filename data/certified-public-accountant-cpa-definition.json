The CPA designation helps enforce professional standards in the accounting industry. Other countries have certifications equivalent to the CPA designation, notably, the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/ca.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">chartered accountant</a> (CA) designation.\n", "\nObtaining the certified public accountant (CPA) designation requires a bachelor\u2019s degree in business administration, finance, or accounting. Individuals are also required to complete 150 hours of education and have no fewer than two years of public accounting experience. CPAs must pass a certification exam whose requirements vary by state. Additionally, keeping the CPA designation requires completing a specific number of continuing education hours yearly.\n", "\nCPAs have a wide range of career options available, either in public or corporate accounting. Individuals with the CPA designation can also move into executive positions such as controllers or chief financial officers (CFOs).\n", "\nCPAs are known for their role in income tax preparation but can specialize in many other areas, such as auditing, bookkeeping, forensic accounting, managerial accounting, and information technology. The CPA designation has become more important after the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sarbanesoxleyact.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) Act of 2002</a>.\n", "\nCertified public accountants are subject to a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/code-of-ethics.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">code of ethics</a>. The <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/updates/enron-scandal-summary/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Enron scandal</a> is an example of CPAs not adhering to such a code. Arthur Andersen company executives and CPAs were charged with illegal and unethical accounting practices. Federal and state laws require CPAs to maintain independence when performing audits and reviews. While consulting at Enron, Arthur Andersen CPAs did not maintain independence and performed both consulting services and auditing services, which violates the CPA code of ethics.\n", "\nCPAs generally end up as an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/040115/do-i-need-personal-accountant.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">accountant</a> of some sort. That is, they put together, maintain, and review financial statements and related transactions for companies. Many CPAs file tax forms or returns for individuals and businesses.\u00a0CPAs can perform and sign off on audits.\n", "\nThe CPA designation isn\u2019t required to work in corporate accounting or for <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/121015/understanding-accounting-private-equity-funds.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">private companies</a>. However, public accountants\u2060\u2014which are individuals working for a firm, such as Deloitte or Ernst &amp; Young, that provides accounting and tax-related services to businesses\u2014must hold a CPA designation.\n", "\nIn 1887, 31 accountants created the American Association of Public Accountants (AAPA) to define moral standards for the accounting industry and U.S. auditing standards for local, state, and federal governments, private companies, and nonprofits. Renamed several times over the years, the organization has been known as the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) since 1957 and also gives CPA certification exams. The first CPAs received licenses in 1896.\n", "\nIn 1934, the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) required all publicly traded companies to file periodic financial reports endorsed by members of the accounting industry. The AICPA established accounting standards until 1973 when the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) was launched to set standards for private companies.\n", "\nThe accounting industry thrived in the late 1990s due to large accounting firms expanding their services to include various forms of consulting. The Enron scandal in 2001 resulted in major changes in the accounting industry, including the fact that Arthur Andersen, one of the nation\u2019s top accounting firms, went out of business. Under the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sarbanesoxleyact.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sarbanes-Oxley Act</a>, which was passed in 2002, accountants were subject to tougher restrictions about their consulting assignments.\n"]}
