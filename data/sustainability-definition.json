It influences them to consider more factors than simply the immediate profit or loss involved. Increasingly, companies have issued <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/040915/investing-green-technologythe-future-now.asp\">sustainability goals</a> such as commitment to zero-waste packaging by a certain year, or to reduce overall emissions by a certain percentage.\n", "\nThese companies can achieve their sustainable needs by cutting emissions, lowering their energy usage, sourcing products from fair-trade organizations, and ensuring their physical waste is disposed of properly and with as small of a carbon footprint as possible.\n", "\nThe push for <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/triple-bottom-line.asp\">sustainability</a> is evident\u00a0in areas such as\u00a0energy generation where the focus has been on finding new deposits to outpace the drawdown on existing reserves. Some electricity companies, for example, now publicly state goals for energy generation from sustainable sources such as\u00a0wind, hydropower, and solar.\n", "\nHowever, moving toward sustainable production is often a complex process for companies. By basing decisions on longer timelines, some of the higher upfront investments in efficiency and renewable sources are easier to justify. Investors have had to adjust their expectations for\u00a0returns because a company that commits\u00a0to the sustainable development of resources may have more modest earnings results in the near term.\n", "\nMany companies have been criticized for exploiting\u00a0cost-cutting measures such as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/offshore.asp\">offshoring</a> production\u00a0to obtain\u00a0cheaper labor. This practice, although\u00a0beneficial\u00a0for the bottom line, often comes at the price of compromised worker safety and security.\n", "\nObtaining cheap offshore labor famously occurred\u00a0in the\u00a0clothing industry following the 2013 Savar factory collapse in Bangladesh, where over 1,100 people died. As a result, many of the companies that are most sensitive to consumer backlash, usually retailers and restaurants, have announced sustainability plans to reduce carbon footprints, packaging waste, and animal suffering.\n", "\nFor example, a factory that allows its waste to flow into a nearby body of water to avoid the short-term costs of proper disposal can cause expensive and significant long-term environmental damage.\n", "\nThis has caused some investors to shy away from sustainable investments\u2014at least until companies become more transparent with their financial and business practices.\n"]}
