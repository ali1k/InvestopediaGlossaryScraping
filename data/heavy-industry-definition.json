The term \"heavy\" refers to the fact that the items produced by \"heavy industry\" used to be products such as iron, coal, oil, ships, etc. Today, the reference also refers to industries that disrupt the environment in the form of pollution, deforestation, etc.\n", "\nHeavy industry typically involves large and\u00a0heavy\u00a0products or\u00a0large and heavy equipment and facilities (such as\u00a0heavy equipment, large\u00a0machine tools, and huge\u00a0buildings); or complex or numerous\u00a0processes. Because of those factors, heavy industry involves higher\u00a0capital intensity\u00a0than\u00a0light industry\u00a0does. Heavy industry is\u00a0also often more heavily\u00a0cyclical\u00a0in\u00a0investment\u00a0and\u00a0employment.\n", "\nTransportation and construction, along with their upstream manufacturing supply businesses, comprised most heavy industry throughout the industrial age, along with some capital-intensive manufacturing. Traditional examples from the Industrial Revolution through\u00a0the early 20th\u00a0century included\u00a0steelmaking,\u00a0artillery\u00a0production,\u00a0locomotive\u00a0erection,\u00a0machine tool building, and the heavier types of\u00a0mining.\n", "\nWhen the\u00a0chemical industry\u00a0and\u00a0electrical industry\u00a0developed, they involved elements\u00a0of both heavy industry and light industry, which was soon also true for the\u00a0automotive industry\u00a0and the\u00a0aircraft industry. Heavy industry\u00a0shipbuilding became the norm as\u00a0steel replaced wood in modern shipbuilding. Large systems are often characteristic of heavy industry, such as the\u00a0construction\u00a0of\u00a0skyscrapers\u00a0and large\u00a0dams\u00a0during the post-World War II\u00a0era, and the manufacture/deployment of large\u00a0rockets\u00a0and giant\u00a0wind turbines\u00a0through the 21st century.\n", "\nAnother trait of heavy industry is that it most often sells its goods to other industrial customers, rather than to the end consumer. Heavy industries tend to be a part of the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/supplychain.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">supply chain</a> of other products. As a result, their stocks will often <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rally.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">rally</a> at the beginning of an economic upturn and are often the first to benefit from an increase in demand.\n", "\nThe economies of many East Asian countries are based on\u00a0heavy industry.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff Among such Japanese and Korean firms, many are\u00a0manufacturers of aerospace products\u00a0and\u00a0defense contractors. Examples include\u00a0Japan's\u00a0Fuji Heavy Industries\u00a0and Korea's\u00a0Hyundai Rotem, a joint project of\u00a0Hyundai Heavy Industries\u00a0and\u00a0Daewoo Heavy Industries.\n", "\nIn the\u00a020th\u00a0century, Asian\u00a0communist states often\u00a0focused on heavy industry as an area for large investments in their planned economies. This decision was motivated by fears of failing to maintain military parity with foreign powers. For example,\u00a0the Soviet Union's manic industrialization in the 1930s, with heavy industry as the favored emphasis, sought to bring its ability to produce trucks, tanks, artillery, aircraft, and warships up to a level that would make the country a\u00a0great power.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n"]}
