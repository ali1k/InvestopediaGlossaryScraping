They take the opposite position of each side of a trade, acting as the buyer to the seller and the seller to the buyer.\n", "\nFor example, if Wendy and Nathan enter into a transaction in which Wendy agrees to sell 100 shares of AMZN to Nathan for $1,180 per share, Nathan will have to pay $1,180 x 100 shares = $118,000. The clearinghouse credits Nathan\u2019s account with 100 AMZN shares and deposits $118,000 to Wendy\u2019s account. Clearinghouses, thus, ensure that the financial markets operate smoothly and efficiently.

A CSD also allows for the settlement of securities transactions. A transaction is settled once the buyer\u2019s account has been credited with the purchased shares and debited the agreed cash amount, and the seller\u2019s account has been debited the shares and credited the sales amount. The credit and debit movements occur simultaneously through a process known as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dvp.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">delivery versus payment</a> (DVP).\n", "\nTransactions between Euroclear participants are settled in the manner described above on a DVP basis on the books of Euroclear. Securities and cash transfers between buyer and seller accounts are final and irrevocable upon settlement. Costs and risks involved in the settlement between Euroclear participants and local market participants are heavily influenced by local market practices.\n", "\nTrades settling through domestic market links settle on a DVP basis only if DVP is provided in the local market. In the same way, settlement in the Euroclear System becomes final and irrevocable in line with the rules of the domestic market. As a rule, Euroclear Bank credits securities to participants only if it has actually received the securities for the account of such participants.\n", "\nAll securities accepted by Euroclear are eligible for securities lending and borrowing except those that are limited by liquidity, fiscal, or legal restrictions. Standard borrowings are allocated whenever a borrower has insufficient securities in its account to make a delivery, provided sufficient securities are available from lending.\n", "\nBorrowings are reimbursed on the first overnight settlement process where securities are available in the borrower\u2019s account. In the program, all securities made available by lenders are aggregated in a lending pool. Securities are then distributed to borrowers and loans are allocated among lenders according to standard procedures.\n"]}
