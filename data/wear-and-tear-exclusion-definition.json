Insurance is designed only to protect against unforeseen losses. If insurance covered inevitable losses, insurers would have to raise their premiums dramatically to cover the expenses.\n", "\nWear and tear exclusions are fairly common.\u00a0Auto insurance policies, for example, do not cover the cost of replacing auto parts that deteriorate with time and use, such as brake pads, timing belts, and water pumps. Auto insurance policies cover only unpredictable events such as collisions.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"5\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nWear and tear exclusions are designed to keep an\u00a0insurer from being held liable when damage results from a customer\u2019s failure to properly maintain, repair,\u00a0and replace <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/111815/does-homeowners-insurance-cover-broken-pipes.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">deteriorated or defective portions of the insured property</a>.

The list of exclusions is generally extensive.\n", "\nAn insurance company may cite\u00a0\u201cwear and tear\u201d on a claim in an effort to avoid a contractual payment. In the case of a natural disaster such as a flood or tornado, insurers will often\u00a0try to\u00a0invoke \u201cwear and tear\u201d and\u00a0blame the\u00a0property damage on a preexisting condition.\n", "\nOther common exclusions include poor maintenance, prior damage, manufacturing defects, or faulty installation. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/111815/does-homeowners-insurance-cover-roof-replacement.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Roof damage claims are often a cause of contention</a>.

This is particularly common when older commercial properties are damaged. An insurance company will inspect the property prior to selling the policy, and the report may show the property was in acceptable or even good condition, but the insurance company may still attempt to make\u00a0the \u201cwear and tear\u201d argument.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nA wear and tear\u00a0exclusion will not have what is commonly referred to as \u201canti-<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/concurrent-causation.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">concurrent cause</a>\u201d lead-in language.
