The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nareit.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NAREIT</a>) originally pioneered this figure, which is a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/non-gaap-earnings.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">non-GAAP</a> measure.\n", "\nFFO is not to be confused with a REIT's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cash-flow-from-operating-activities.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cash flow from operations</a>, which is reported on the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/investing/what-is-a-cash-flow-statement/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">statement of cash flows (CFS)</a>. Instead, FFO measures the net amount of cash and equivalents that flows into a firm from regular, ongoing business activities. FFO should not be seen as an alternative to cash flow or as a measure of liquidity.\n", "\nFor example, a typical company's cash flow would be influenced by the money earned from the sale of an asset, but FFO excludes those gains. Also, a typical company would show a cash inflow on its CFS if the company received loan proceeds from a bank. However, FFO does not include such cash inflows, but instead, it is only a measure of the income from business activities.\n", "\nFFO compensates for cost-accounting methods that may inaccurately communicate a REIT's true performance. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gaap.asp\">GAAP</a> accounting requires that all REITs depreciate their <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investment-property.asp\">investment properties</a> over time\u00a0using one of the standard depreciation methods. However, many investment properties actually increase in value over time, making depreciation inaccurate in describing the value of a REIT. Depreciation and amortization must be added back to net income to reconcile this issue.\n", "\nFFO also subtracts any gains on sales of property\u00a0because these types of sales are considered to be nonrecurring. REITs must pay out 90% of all <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxableincome.asp\">taxable income</a> in the form of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp\">dividends</a>, which are cash payments to investors. Gains on sales of property do not add to a REIT's taxable income and should therefore not be included in the measurement of value and performance.\n", "\nAs mentioned, FFO per share is sometimes provided by firms as a supplement to their EPS. Earnings per share is a company's net income divided by the outstanding <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equity.asp\">equity</a> shares. EPS and FFO per share provide a measure of how much income is being generated on a per-share basis.\n", "\nThese measures also help investors determine whether the money is being used effectively by management. Also, many analysts and investors assess a REIT's price-FFO ratio as a supplement to the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-earningsratio.asp\">price-earnings\u00a0ratio</a>, which is the stock price divided by EPS. In the case of a REIT, the market price of the REIT would be divided by its FFO per share.\n", "\nIncreasingly, real estate <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/analyst.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">analysts</a>\u00a0are also calculating\u00a0a REIT's adjusted funds from operations (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/affo.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AFFO</a>). This calculation takes a REIT's FFO and subtracts any recurring expenditure that is <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalization.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">capitalized</a> and then amortized, as well as any <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/straightlinebasis.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">straight-lining</a> of rents.

AFFO has gained traction as a more accurate estimate of a REIT's earnings potential.\n", "\nThe AFFO measure was developed\u00a0to provide a better measure of a REIT's\u00a0cash generated or dividend-paying capacity. In addition to AFFO, this alternate measure is sometimes referred to as funds available for distribution or cash available for distribution.\n", "\nPopular mall REIT Simon Property Group reported funds from operations on its 2017 income statement of\u00a0$4 billion, up 6% from 2016.\u00a0The firm's net income, meanwhile, totaled $2.2 billion.\u00a0\n", "\nTo arrive at FFO, the firm added back depreciation and amortization of about $1.8 billion, and further adjusted for other smaller figures\u2014including a\u00a0reduction\u00a0of $5.3\u00a0million for payment of preferred distributions\u00a0and dividends,\u00a0and a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/noncontrolling_interest.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">noncontrolling interests</a> portion of depreciation and amortization that resulted in an additional $17.1\u00a0million\u00a0reduction.
