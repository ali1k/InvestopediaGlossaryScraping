For example, a classroom of 30 students with 15 males and 15 females could generate a representative sample that might include six students: three males and three females. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sample.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Samples</a> are useful in statistical analysis when population sizes are large because they contain smaller, manageable versions of the larger group.\n", "\nSampling is used in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/statistics.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">statistical analysis</a> methodologies to gain insights and observations about a population group. Statisticians can use a variety of sampling methods to build samples that seek to meet the goals of their research studies. Representative samples are one type of sampling method. This method uses stratified random sampling to help identify its components. Other methods can include random sampling and systematic sampling.\n", "\nStatisticians can choose the representative characteristics that they feel best meet their research goals. Typically, representative sample characteristics are focused on <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/demographics.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">demographic categories</a>. Some examples of key characteristics can include sex, age, education level, socioeconomic status, and marital status. Generally, the larger the population being examined, the more characteristics that may arise for consideration.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/071615/when-it-better-use-systematic-over-simple-random-sampling.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Choosing a sampling method</a> can depend on a variety of factors. Representative samples are usually an ideal choice for sampling analysis because they are expected to yield insights and observations that closely align with the entire <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/population.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">population group</a>.\n", "\nWhen a sample is not representative, it can be known as a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/simple-random-sample.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">random sample</a>. While random sampling is a simplified sampling approach, it comes with a higher risk of sampling error which can potentially lead to incorrect results or strategies that can be costly. Random sampling can choose its components completely at random, such as choosing names randomly from a list. Using the classroom example again, a random sample could include six male students.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/systematic-sampling.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Systematic sampling</a> is another type of sampling method that seeks to systemize its components. This type of sampling may include choosing every fifth person from a population list to gather a sample. While this method takes a systematic approach, it is still likely to result in a random sample.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/stratified_random_sampling.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stratified random sampling</a> can be an important part of the process in creating a representative sample. Stratified random sampling examines the characteristics of a population group and breaks down the population into what is known as strata. Dividing out the population by strata helps an analyst to easily choose the appropriate number of individuals from each stratum based on proportions of the population. While this method is more time consuming\u2014and often more costly as it requires more upfront information\u2014the information yielded is typically of higher quality.\n", "\nA representative sample is generally expected to yield the best collection of results. Representative samples are known for collecting results, insights, and observations that can be confidently relied on as a representation of the larger population being studied. As such, representative sampling is typically the best method for <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketing-plan.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">marketing</a> or psychology studies.\n", "\nWhile representative samples are often the sampling method of choice, they do have some barriers. Oftentimes, it is impractical in terms of time, budget, and effort to collect the data needed to build a representative sample. Using <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/032615/what-are-some-examples-stratified-random-sampling.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">stratified random sampling</a>, researchers must identify characteristics, divide the population into strata, and proportionally choose individuals for the representative sample.\n", "\nIn general, the larger the population target to be studied the more difficult representative sampling can be. This method can be especially difficult for an extremely large population such as an entire country or race. When dealing with large populations it can also be difficult to obtain the desired members for participation. For example, individuals who are too busy to participate will be under-represented in the representative sample.
