However, since the passage of the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-card-accountability-responsibility-and-disclosure-act-of-2009.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility, and Disclosure Act (CARD Act)</a> in 2009, credit card companies are only permitted to increase their interest rates on any new purchases made by the customer. <span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff This means that customers who fail to make their minimum payments can at least continue paying off their past purchases using their older and lower interest rate, thereby making it easier for them to work their way out of debt.\n", "\nAlthough the CARD Act did not prohibit universal default provisions altogether, it did help make them less costly for credit card users. After all, the increased interest rates charged under the universal default provision may be substantially higher than the card\u2019s standard <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/apr.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">annual percentage rate (APR)</a>. These higher rates, which are referred to as the \u201cdefault APR\u201d, are often 30% or more. Under the terms of the CARD Act, credit card companies must give the customer 45 days\u2019 notice before levying this increased interest rate.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nIn light of these universal default provisions, customers would be wise to carefully review their cardholder agreements in order to understand what interest rates they might be required to pay in the event of default.
