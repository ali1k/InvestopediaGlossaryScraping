The Howey Test is important to understand for <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp\">blockchain</a> and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/digital-currency.asp\">digital currency</a> investors and project backers.

W.J. Howey Co.</em>, which reached the Supreme Court in 1946. Howey Company sold tracts of citrus groves to buyers in Florida, who would then <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leaseback.asp\">lease back</a> the land to Howey. Company staff would tend to the groves and sell the fruit on behalf of the owners. Both parties shared in the revenue. Most buyers had no experience in agriculture and were not required to tend to the land themselves.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\"></span>\n", "\nHowey had failed to register the transactions and the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp\">U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) intervened. The court's final ruling determined the leaseback arrangements qualified as investment contracts.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\"></span>\n", "\nIn doing so, the Supreme Court established four criteria to determine whether an investment contract exists. An investment contract is:<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\"></span>\n", "\nIn the case of Howey, the buyers of the Florida citrus groves saw the transactions as valuable primarily because the labor and expertise were provided by others. Buyers only needed to invest capital to access an income stream. This classified the transaction as an investment contract under what is now known as the Howey Test, and therefore it needed to be registered with the SEC.\n", "\nDigital currencies such as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bitcoin.asp\">Bitcoin</a> are notoriously difficult to categorize. They are decentralized and, as such, elude regulation in many ways. Nonetheless, the SEC has taken an interest in digital assets and has sought to clarify when their sale meets the definition of an investment contract.\n", "\nAccording to the SEC, the \"investment of money\" test is easily satisfied with digital assets sales, because <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiatmoney.asp\">fiat money</a> or other digitals assets are being exchanged. Likewise, the \"common enterprise\" test is also easily met.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\"></span>\n", "\nIn most cases, whether a digital asset qualifies as an investment contract largely turns on whether there is an \"expectation of profit to be derived from the efforts of others.\"<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\"></span>\n", "\nFor example, the purchasers of a digital asset may be relying on the efforts of others if they depend on the project's backers to develop and maintain the digital network (especially in the early stages), rather than these tasks being performed by a dispersed community of unaffiliated users. The test is also met if the project's backers take steps to support the price of the digital asset, such as by creating scarcity though <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/tech/cryptocurrency-burning-can-it-manage-inflation/\">token burning</a>. Another way the \"efforts of others\" test is met is if the project's backers continue to act in a managerial role.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\"></span>\n", "\nThese are but a handful of examples outlined by the SEC. If the success of a project depends on the ongoing participation of its backers, the purchaser of the associated digital asset is likely relying on the \"efforts of others.\"\n", "\nA host of implications are raised if the SEC determines a cryptocurrency token is a security. Effectively, it means the SEC can determine whether or not a token can be sold to U.S. investors and compels the project to register with the SEC.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\"></span>\n", "\nA significant application of the Howey Test came in 2017, when the SEC ruled that the sale of DAO tokens in exchange for <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ether-cryptocurrency.asp\">Ether</a> violated federal securities law. Instead of taking enforcement action, the SEC warned that securities laws applied to token sales\u2014effectively firing a warning shot at the crypto industry.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\"></span>\n", "\nBecause of the Howey Test, most ICOs that take place today are likely to be off limits to U.S investors. In 2018, then SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said every ICO he'd seen could be classified as a security.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"5\"></span>\n"]}
