As part of their political or economic strategy, some countries\u00a0frequently use nontariff barriers to restrict the amount of trade they conduct with other countries.\n", "\nCountries commonly use nontariff barriers in international trade. Decisions about when to impose nontariff barriers are influenced by the political alliances of a country and the overall availability of goods and services.\n", "\nIn general, any barrier to international trade\u2013including tariffs and non-tariff barriers\u2013influences the global economy\u00a0because\u00a0it limits the functions of the free market. The lost revenue that some companies may experience from these barriers to trade may be considered\u00a0an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economicprofit.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">economic loss</a>, especially for proponents of laissez-faire capitalism. Advocates of laissez-faire capitalism believe that governments should abstain from interfering in the workings of the free market.\n", "\nCountries can use nontariff barriers in place of, or in conjunction with, conventional tariff barriers, which are taxes that an exporting country pays to an\u00a0importing country\u00a0for goods or services. Tariffs are the most common type of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/08/tariff-trade-barrier-basics.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">trade barrier</a>, and they increase the cost of products and services in\u00a0an importing country.\n", "\nOften times countries pursue alternatives to standard tariffs because they release countries from paying added tax on imported goods. Alternatives to standard tariffs can have a meaningful impact on the level of trade (while creating a different monetary impact than standard tariffs).\n", "\nCountries may use licenses to limit imported goods to specific businesses. If a business is granted a trade license, it is permitted\u00a0to import goods that would otherwise be\u00a0restricted for trade in the country.\n", "\nCountries often issue\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quota.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">quotas</a> for\u00a0importing and exporting\u00a0both goods and services. With quotas, countries agree on specified limits for\u00a0products and services allowed for importation to a country. In most cases, there are no restrictions on importing these goods and services until a country reaches its quota, which it can set for a specific timeframe. Additionally, quotas are often used in international trade licensing\u00a0agreements.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/embargo.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Embargoes</a> are when a country\u2013or several countries\u2013officially ban the trade of specified goods and services with another country. Governments may take this measure\u00a0to support their specific political or economic\u00a0goals.\n", "\nCountries impose <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tradesanction.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sanctions</a> on other countries to limit their trade activity. Sanctions can include increased administrative actions\u2013or additional customs and trade procedures\u2013that slow or limit a country\u2019s ability to trade.\n", "\nExporting countries sometimes use voluntary export restraints. Voluntary export restraints set limits on the number of\u00a0goods and services a country can export to specified countries. These restraints are typically based on availability and political alliances.\n", "\nIn December 2017, the United Nations adopted a round of nontariff barriers against North Korea and the Kim Jong\u00a0Un regime. The nontariff barriers included sanctions that cut\u00a0exports of gasoline, diesel, and other refined oil products to the nation. They also prohibited\u00a0the export of industrial equipment, machinery, transport\u00a0vehicles, and industrial metals to North Korea. The intention of these nontariff barriers was to put economic pressure on the nation to stop its nuclear arms and military exercises.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n"]}
