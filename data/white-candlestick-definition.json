It is a point on a security's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/candlestick.asp\">candlestick</a> chart representing a bullish period.\n", "\nWhite candlesticks represent a positive increase in a security\u2019s price during the observed period of time. The body of the candlestick will typically be displayed in white on a candlestick series chart to show that the net result of the period's price action was up. In some technical charting systems the trader may have the option to choose a specified color, such as blue or green, to represent price gains.\n", "\nTypically, a candlestick will show the security's open, high, low, and close for the user specified time period. The high and low will be shown by the two wicks on each end of the body. The body comprises the distance between the period's open and close prices. Thus, candlestick marks show the range of prices that the security has reported through a single period.\n", "\nCandlestick charts are convenient for technical traders because they can easily display a full day's price movement. Generally, the default colors for candlestick charts will be either white/green (UP) and red/black (DOWN), though, nowadays, charting packages offer the trader the option to customize the color schemes to their specifications.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/red-candlestick.asp\">Red/black candlesticks</a> are the opposite of white candlesticks. They represent a downward movement for the day. In a red/black candlestick, the closing price of a security is reported as lower than the opening price.\n", "\nThe last possibility for charting a period's price action is where the open and close prices are identical. This is called a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/doji.asp\">doji</a> and is graphically portrayed by a dash, signifying that the charted security\u2019s opening price is equal to its closing price.\n", "\nTechnical analysis indicators are formed from the combination of white, red, and doji candlesticks. There are many short-term and long-term formations that can be used as indicators for security investment. Below are a few trading patterns commonly identified on a technical analysis chart.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/ascendingchannel.asp\">Ascending channel</a>: An ascending channel is formed when a security\u2019s price is rising. This type of channel will predominantly include white candlesticks.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/descendingchannel.asp\">Descending channel</a>: A descending channel is formed when a security\u2019s price is decreasing over time. This type of channel will predominantly include red candlesticks.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearish-abandoned-baby.asp\">Bearish abandoned baby</a>: A bearish abandoned baby pattern is comprised of three consecutive candlesticks centered with a doji. A bearish abandoned baby can signal a breakout to the downside. This pattern occurs when a white candlestick is followed by a doji above the previous day\u2019s close and then a red candlestick with an open below the previous day\u2019s close.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bullish-abandoned-baby.asp\">Bullish abandoned baby</a>: A bullish abandoned baby pattern is the opposite of a bearish abandoned baby. This pattern signals a potential reversal to the upside. A bullish abandoned baby pattern will begin with a red candlestick followed by a doji below the previous day\u2019s close and then a white candlestick with an open above the previous day\u2019s doji open/close.\n"]}
