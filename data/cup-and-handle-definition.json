The cup and handle is considered a bullish signal, with the right-hand side of the pattern typically experiencing lower trading volume. The pattern's formation may be as short as seven\u00a0weeks or as long as 65 weeks.\n", "\nAmerican technician William J. O'Neil defined the\u00a0cup and handle\u00a0(C&amp;H) pattern in his 1988 classic,\u00a0\"How to Make Money in Stocks,\"<em>\u00a0</em>adding technical requirements through a series of articles published in Investor\u2019s Business Daily, which he founded in 1984.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff <span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff O'Neil included time frame measurements for each component, as well as a detailed description of the rounded lows that give the pattern its unique tea cup appearance.\n", "\nAs a stock forming this pattern tests old highs, it is likely to incur selling pressure from investors who previously bought at those levels; selling pressure is likely to make price consolidate with a tendency toward a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/downtrend.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">downtrend</a> trend for a period of four days to four weeks, before advancing higher. A cup and handle is considered a bullish continuation pattern and is used to identify buying opportunities.\n", "\nIt is worth considering the following when detecting cup and handle patterns:\n", "\nA retest of previous resistance is not required to touch or come within several <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tick.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ticks</a> of the old high; however, the further the top of the handle is away from the highs, the more significant the breakout needs to be.\n", "\nThe image below depicts a classic cup and handle formation. Place a stop buy order slightly above the upper trend line of the handle. Order execution should only occur if the price breaks the pattern\u2019s resistance. Traders may experience excess slippage and enter\u00a0a false breakout using an aggressive entry. Alternatively, wait for the price to close above the upper trend line of the handle, subsequently place a limit order slightly below the pattern\u2019s breakout level, attempting to get an execution if the price retraces. There is a risk of missing the trade if the price continues to advance and does not pull back.\n", "\nA profit target is determined by measuring the distance between the bottom of the cup and the pattern\u2019s breakout level, and extending that distance upward from the breakout. For example, if the distance between the bottom of the cup and handle breakout level is 20 points, a profit target is placed 20 points above the pattern's handle. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stop-lossorder.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stop loss orders</a> may be placed either below the handle or below the cup depending on the trader\u2019s risk tolerance and market volatility.\n", "\nNow let's consider a real-world historical example using Wynn Resorts, Limited (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=wynn\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">WYNN</a>), which went\u00a0public on the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nasdaq.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nasdaq</a>\u00a0exchange near $13 in October 2002 and rose to $154 five years later.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff <span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff The subsequent decline ended within two points of the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ipo.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">initial public offering</a>\u00a0(IPO) price, far exceeding O'Neil's requirement for a shallow cup high in the prior trend. The subsequent recovery wave reached the prior high in 2011, nearly 10 years after the first print. The handle follows the classic pullback expectation, finding support at the 50% retracement in a rounded shape, and returns to the high for a second time 14 months later.\u00a0The stock broke out in October 2013 and added 90 points in the following five months.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"6\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\n", "\nLike all technical indicators, the cup and handle should be used in concert with other signals and indicators before making a trading decision. Specifically with the cup and handle, certain limitations have been identified by practitioners. First is that it can take some time for the pattern to fully form, which can lead to late decisions. While one month to one year is the typical timeframe for a cup and handle to form, it can also happen quite quickly or take several years to establish itself, making it ambiguous in some cases. Another issue has to do with the depth of the cup part of the formation. Sometimes a shallower cup can be a signal, while other times a deep cup can produce a false signal. Sometimes the cup forms without the characteristic handle. Finally, one limitation shared across many technical patterns is that it can be unreliable in illiquid stocks.\n", "\nA cup and handle is a technical indicator where the price movement of a security resembles a \u201ccup\u201d followed by a downward trending price pattern. This drop, or \u201chandle\u201d is meant to signal a buying opportunity to go long on a security. When this part of the price formation is over, the security may reverse course and reach new highs. Typically, cup and handle patterns fall between seven weeks to over a year.\n", "\nAs a general rule, cup and handle patterns are bullish price formations. Founder of the term, William O\u2019Neil identified four primary stages of this technical trading pattern. First, approximately one to three months before the \u201ccup\u201d pattern begins, a security will reach a new high in an uptrend. Second, the security will retrace, dropping no more than 50% of the previous high creating a rounding bottom. Third, the security will rebound to its previous high, but subsequently decline, forming the \u201chandle\u201d part of the formation. Finally, the security breaks out again, surpassing its highs that are equal to the depth of the cup\u2019s low point.\u00a0\n", "\nConsider a scenario where a stock has recently reached a high after significant momentum, but has since corrected, falling almost 50%. At this point, an investor may purchase the stock, anticipating that it will bounce back to previous levels. The stock then rebounds, testing the previous high resistance levels, after which it falls into a sideways trend. In the final leg of the pattern, the stock exceeds these resistance levels, soaring 50% above the previous high.\u00a0\n"]}
