The statement typically includes general information about the individual, such as name and address, along with a breakdown of\u00a0total <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">assets</a> and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liability.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">liabilities</a>. The statement can help individuals track their financial goals and wealth, and can be used when they apply for <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">credit</a>.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-statements.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Financial statements</a> can be prepared for either companies or individuals. An individual\u2019s financial statement is referred to as a personal financial statement\u00a0and is a simpler version of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-statements.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">corporate statements</a>. Both are tools that can show the financial health of the subject.\n", "\nA personal financial statement shows the individual's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/networth.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">net worth</a>\u2014their assets minus their liabilities\u2014which reflects what that person has in cash if they sell all their assets and pay off all their debts. If their liabilities are greater than their assets, the financial statement indicates a negative net worth. If the individual has more assets than liabilities, they end up with a positive net worth.\n", "\nKeeping an updated personal financial statement allows an individual to track how their financial health improves or deteriorates over time. These can be invaluable tools when consumers want to change their financial sitution or apply for credit such as a loan or a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortgage.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mortgage</a>. Knowing where they stand financially allows consumers to avoid unnecessary inquiries on their <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditreport.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">credit reports</a> and the hassles of declined credit applications.\n", "\nThe statement allows also <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">credit</a> officers to easily gain perspective into the applicant's financial situation in order to make an informed credit decision. In many cases, the individual or couple may be asked to provide a personal guarantee for part of the loan or they may be required to put up <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/collateral.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">collateral</a> to secure the loan.\n", "\nA personal financial statement is broken down into assets and liabilities. Assets include the value of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">securities</a> and funds held in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/checking-vs-savings-accounts-4783514\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">checking or savings accounts</a>, retirement account balances, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tradingaccount.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">trading accounts</a>, and real estate. Liabilities include any debts the individual may have including personal loans, credit cards, student loans, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/back-taxes.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">unpaid taxes</a>, and mortgages. Debts that are jointly owned are also included. Married couples may create joint personal financial statements by combining their assets and liabilities.\n", "\nIncome and expenses are also included if the statement is used to attain credit or to show someone's overall financial position. This can be tracked on a separate sheet or an addendum, called the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incomestatement.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">income statement</a>. This includes all forms of income and expenses\u2014typically expressed in the form of monthly or yearly amounts.\n", "\nThe following items are not included in a personal financial statement:\n", "\nKeep in mind. Your credit report and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-history.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">credit history</a> are big considerations when it comes to getting new credit and every <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lender.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lender</a> has different requirements for issuing credit. So, even if you have a positive net worth\u2014more assets than liabilities\u2014you may still be refused a loan or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditcard.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">credit card</a> if you haven't paid your previous debts on time or have too many inquiries on file.\n", "\nLet's assume that Henry wants to track his net worth as he moves toward <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/retirement.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">retirement</a>. He has been paying off debts, saving money, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/06/invest1000.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">investing</a>, and is getting closer to owning his home. Each year, he updates the statement to see the progress he has made.\n", "\nHere's how he would break it down. He would list all his assets\u2014$20,000 for a car, $200,000 for his house, $300,000 in investments, and $50,000 in cash and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashequivalents.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">equivalents</a>. He also owns some highly collectible stamps and art valued at $20,000 that he can list. His total assets are, therefore, $590,000. As for liabilities, Henry owes $5,000 on the car and $50,000 for his house. Although makes all of his purchases with a credit card, he pays the balance off each month and never carries a balance. Henry cosigned a loan for his daughter and there is $10,000 remaining on that. Even though it is not Henry's loan, he is still responsible, so it is included in the statement. Henry's liabilities are $65,000.\n", "\nWhen we subtract his liabilities from his assets, Henry's net worth is $525,000. Although he uses it mainly to track his financial health, Henry can use this information\u2014and the statement as a whole\u2014if he wants to apply for any other credit.\n"]}
