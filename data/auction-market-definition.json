The price at which a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/082614/how-stock-market-works.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">stock trades</a> represents the highest price that a buyer is willing to pay and the lowest price that a seller is willing to accept. Matching bids and offers are then paired together, and the orders are executed. The <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nyse.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)</a> is an example of an auction market.\n", "\nThe process involved in an auction market differs from the process in an over-the-counter <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/over-the-countermarket.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">(OTC) market</a>.

Most traditional auctions involve multiple potential buyers\u00a0or bidders, but only a single seller, whereas\u00a0auction markets for <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">securities</a> have multiple buyers and multiple sellers, all looking to make deals simultaneously.\n", "\nAn <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/auction.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">auction</a> market also known as a double auction market, allows buyers and sellers to submit prices they deem acceptable to a list. When a match between a buyer\u2019s price and a seller\u2019s asking price is found, the trade proceeds at that price. Trades without matches will not be executed.\n", "\nImagine that four buyers want to buy a share of company XYZ\u00a0and make the following bids: $10.00, $10.02, $10.03 and $10.06, respectively. Conversely, four sellers wish to sell shares of company XYZ, and these sellers\u00a0submitted offers to sell their shares at the following prices: $10.06, $10.09, $10.12 and $10.13, respectively.\n", "\nIn this scenario, the individuals that made bids/offers for company XYZ at $10.06 will have their orders executed. All remaining orders will not immediately be executed, and the current price of company XYZ will be $10.06.\n", "\nThe <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/ustreasury.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">U.S. Treasury</a> holds <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bill-auction.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">auctions</a> to finance certain government financial activities. The Treasury auction is open to the public and\u00a0various larger investment entities. These bids are submitted electronically and are divided into competing and noncompeting bids\u00a0depending on the person or entity who places the recorded bid.\n", "\nNoncompeting bids are addressed first because noncompetitive bidders are guaranteed to receive a predetermined amount of securities as a minimum and\u00a0up to a maximum of $5 million. These are most commonly entered by individual investors or those representing small entities.\n", "\nIn competitive bidding, once the auction period closes, all of the incoming bids are\u00a0reviewed to determine the winning price. Securities are sold\u00a0to the competing bidders based on the amount listed within the bid. Once all of the securities have been sold, the remaining competing bidders will not receive any securities.\n"]}
