By comparing what a country owes with what it produces, the debt-to-GDP ratio reliably indicates that particular country\u2019s\u00a0ability to pay back its debts. Often expressed as a percentage, this ratio can also be interpreted as the number of years needed to pay back debt, if GDP is dedicated entirely to debt repayment.\n", "\nA country able to continue paying interest on its debt--without refinancing, and without hampering economic growth, is generally considered to be stable.
