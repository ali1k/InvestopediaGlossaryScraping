The version of the form used is determined by both whether or not the filer is an individual or a business and the nature of the income the filer received. The forms are effective for the year in which they are signed and three calendar years afterward. Therefore, a W-8BEN signed on Sept. 1, 2020, would be valid through Dec. 31, 2023.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nThe W-8 series forms are fairly complex. Though they require basic information such as name, country of origin, and taxpayer identification number, they also ask for the contacts from which the filer is receiving the reported income. A professional is often consulted to assist in completing them.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nForm W-8BEN (\"Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting\") must be submitted by foreign persons who receive certain types of income in the United States.

You must submit the form regardless of whether you are claiming a reduced withholding.\n", "\nIndividuals must submit the form to the payer or withholding agent prior to receiving income or credits from them.

Instead, after subtracting applicable deductions, it is taxed at the graduated rate that U.S. citizens and resident aliens pay. If your work is covered by a U.S. treaty, it would be taxed at the lowest rate under that treaty.\n", "\nIn most cases, you must have engaged in a trade or business activities in the United States sometime during the tax year to be able to categorize income as ECI. That would be the case if, for example, a foreign individual performed personal services in the United States during the year. In addition, money made by a foreigner through investments in a partnership that conducts trade or business in the U.S. would also be treated as ECI.\n", "\nHowever, foreigners whose sole U.S. income is based on the trading of securities or commodities through a U.S.-based broker are not considered to be engaged in a trade or business with the United States.
