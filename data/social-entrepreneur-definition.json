These individuals are willing to take on the risk and effort to create positive changes in society through their initiatives. Social entrepreneurs may believe that this practice is a way to connect you to your life's purpose, help others find theirs, and make a difference in the world (all while eking out a living).\n", "\nWidespread use of ethical practices\u2014such as\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/impact-investing.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">impact investing</a>, conscious consumerism,\u00a0and\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corp-social-responsibility.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">corporate social responsibility</a>\u00a0programs\u2014facilitates the success of social entrepreneurs.\n", "\nWhile most entrepreneurs are motivated by the potential to earn a profit, the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profit-motive.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">profit motive</a>\u00a0does not prevent the ordinary entrepreneur from having a positive impact on society.

These institutions provide banking services to unemployed or low-income individuals or groups who otherwise would have no other access to financial services. Other examples of social entrepreneurship include educational programs, providing banking services in underserved areas, and helping children orphaned by epidemic disease. All of these efforts are intended to address unmet needs within communities that have been overlooked or not granted access to services, products, or base essentials available in more developed communities.\n", "\nA social entrepreneur might also seek to address imbalances in such availability, the root causes behind such social problems, or the social stigma associated with being a resident of such communities.

SRI is the practice of investing money in companies and funds that have positive social impacts. SRI has also grown in popularity in recent years. Socially responsible investors will often eschew investments in companies that produce or sell addictive substances (like alcohol, gambling, and tobacco). They may also seek out companies that are engaged in social justice, environmental sustainability, and alternative energy/clean technology efforts.\n", "\nSocially conscious investors screen potential new investments for environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria.

A social entrepreneur may have the goal of providing access to communities that lack stable utilities of their own.\n", "\nIn the modern era, social entrepreneurship is often combined with technology assets: for example, bringing high-speed internet connectivity to remote communities so that school-age children have more access to information and knowledge resources.\n", "\nThe development of mobile apps that speak to the needs of a particular community is another way social entrepreneurship is expressed. This can include giving individuals ways to alert their city administrations to problems such as burst water mains, downed powerlines, or patterns of repeated traffic accidents. There are also apps created to report infractions committed by city officials or even law enforcement that can help give a voice to the community through technology.\n"]}
