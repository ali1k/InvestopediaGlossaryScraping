For this reason, banks will usually command a higher <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">interest rate</a> on a nonconforming loan.\u00a0\n", "\nAlthough private banks initially write most mortgages, they often end up in the portfolios of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

An MBS\u00a0is a type of\u00a0asset-backed security (ABS) secured by a collection of mortgages that originated from a regulated and authorized financial institution. While there are private financial companies who will buy, package, and resell an MBS, Fannie and Freddie are the two largest purchasers.\n", "\nBanks use the money from the sales of\u00a0mortgages to invest in offering new loans, at the current interest rate.

The two GSEs have federal rules\u00a0limits to buying loans that are deemed relatively risk-free. These loans\u00a0are conforming mortgages, and banks like them precisely because they will readily sell.\n", "\nBy contrast, mortgages that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac cannot buy are inherently riskier for banks to write. These difficult-to-sell loans must either stay in the bank\u2019s portfolio or be sold to entities specializing in the secondary market for nonconforming loans.\n", "\nThere are various borrower situations and types of loans that Fannie and Freddie deem as nonconforming.\u00a0\n", "\nThe most common nonconforming mortgage is what\u2019s often called a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jumboloan.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">jumbo mortgage</a>\u2014loans written for an amount more substantial than the\u00a0Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac\u00a0limits. In 2021, that limit in most U.S. counties is\u00a0$548,250, but in some high-cost areas, such as New York City or San Francisco, it can be as high as $822,375.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nMortgages don\u2019t have to be jumbo to be nonconforming. A low down payment can trigger nonconforming status, too. The threshold varies but could be 10-percent on a conventional mortgage or as little as 3-percent on a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fhaloan.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loan</a>.\n", "\nAlso, a factor is the buyer\u2019s <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dti.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">debt-to-income ratio</a>\u00a0(DTI), which typically needs to be lower than 42-percent to qualify as a conforming loan.

For example, buyers of condos often get tripped up when they learn their dream vacation unit is nonconforming because the complex is considered non-warrantable. That includes condo associations where a single entity, such as the developer, owns more than 10-percent of the units. Other pitfalls include if a majority of the units are not owner-occupied, if more than 25-percent of the square footage is commercial, or if the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hoa.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">homeowners association</a> (HOA) is in litigation.\n"]}
