The model's goal is\u00a0to predict future securities\u00a0or financial market moves by examining the differences between values in the series instead of through\u00a0actual values.\n", "\nAn ARIMA model can be understood by outlining each of its components as follows:\n", "\nEach component functions as a parameter with a standard notation. For ARIMA models, a standard notation would be ARIMA\u00a0with p, d, and q, where integer values substitute for the parameters to indicate the type of ARIMA model used. The parameters can be defined as:\n", "\nIn a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nonlinear-regression.asp\">linear regression</a> model, for example, the number and type of terms are included. A 0 value, which can be used as a parameter, would mean that particular component should not be used in the model. This way, the ARIMA model can be constructed to perform the function of an ARMA model, or\u00a0even simple AR, I, or MA models.\n", "\nIn an autoregressive integrated moving average model,\u00a0the data are\u00a0differenced\u00a0in order to make it stationary. A model that shows stationarity is one that shows there is constancy to the data over time. Most economic and market data show trends, so\u00a0the purpose of differencing is\u00a0to remove any trends or seasonal structures.\u00a0\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/seasonality.asp\">Seasonality</a>, or when data show regular and predictable patterns that repeat over a calendar year, could negatively affect the regression model. If a trend appears\u00a0and stationarity is not evident, many of the computations throughout the process cannot be made with great efficacy.\n"]}
