These taxes are levied on the beneficiary who receives the property in the deceased's will or the estate which pays the tax before transferring the inherited property.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"12\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nDeath taxes are also called death duties, estate tax, or inheritance tax.\n", "\nThe death tax can be any tax that is imposed on the transfer of property after someone's death.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff The term \u201cdeath tax\u201d gained popularity in 1990s and was used to describe estate and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inheritancetax.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">inheritance taxes</a> by those who want the taxes repealed.

For instance, the 2018 federal tax law applies the estate tax to any amount above $10 million,<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"14\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff which, when indexed for inflation, allows individuals to pass on $11.18 million ($22.36 million for couples), without paying a penny of tax.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff For example, assume an individual leaves $11.8 million (accounted for inflation) in non-exempt assets to his children. The amount above the federal level, that is, $11.8 million \u2013 $11.2 million = $1.02 million, will be subject to estate tax.

As long as the decedent's estate is valued at less than the applicable exemption amount for the year of death, the estate won't owe any federal estate taxes.\n", "\nThe <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unified-tax-credit.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">unified tax credit</a> has a set amount that an individual can <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gift.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">gift</a> during their lifetime before any death taxes or gift taxes apply. The tax credit unifies both the gift and estate taxes into one tax system which decreases the tax bill of the individual or estate, dollar to dollar. Since some people prefer to use the unified tax credits to save on estate taxes after their deaths, the unified tax credit may not be used for reducing gift taxes while still alive, and may instead be used on the inheritance amount bequeathed to beneficiaries after death.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"9\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nAnother provision available to reduce death tax is the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unlimited-marital-deduction.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">unlimited marital deduction</a>, which allows an individual to transfer an unrestricted amount of assets to his or her spouse at any time, including at the death of the transferor, free from tax.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"10\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff The provision eliminates both the federal estate and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gifttax.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">gift tax</a> on transfers of property between spouses, in effect treating them as one economic unit. The transfer to surviving spouses is made possible through an unlimited deduction from estate and gift tax that postpones the transfers taxes on the property inherited from each other until the second spouse\u2019s death.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"11\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff In other words, the unlimited marital deduction allows married couples to delay the payment of estate taxes upon the death of the first spouse because after the surviving spouse dies, all assets in the estate over the applicable exclusion amount will be included in the survivor\u2019s taxable estate unless the assets are used up or gifted during the surviving spouse's lifetime.\n"]}
