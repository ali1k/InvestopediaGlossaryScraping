These insurance lines generally protect people and their families from losses they couldn\u2019t afford to cover on their own.\u00a0Personal\u00a0insurance lines\u00a0make\u00a0it possible to do things such as driving a car and owning a home without risking financial ruin.\n", "\nAs mentioned above, personal lines insurance is any type of insurance coverage purchased by an individual to cover themselves and/or their families. These policies protect against different kinds of personal <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risk.asp\">risks</a> that would lead to potentially crushing financial losses caused by fire, theft, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0311/the-financial-effects-of-a-natural-disaster.aspx\">natural disasters</a>, death, accidents, lawsuits, and illness.\n", "\nPersonal lines insurance includes products such as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/homeowners-insurance.asp\">homeowners insurance</a>, flood insurance, earthquake insurance, renters insurance, automobile insurance, life insurance, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/disability-insurance.asp\">disability insurance</a>, umbrella insurance, and health insurance. Some types of personal insurance, such as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/automobile-liability-insurance.asp\">automobile liability insurance</a>,\u00a0are often required by law.\u00a0For instance, required minimum levels of automobile liability insurance\u00a0are common and can vary by\u00a0jurisdiction.\u00a0Other\u00a0types of personal lines insurance, such as comprehensive and collision automobile insurance and homeowners insurance, may be required by lenders when a property is\u00a0used as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/collateral.asp\">collateral</a> for a loan.\n", "\nThe amount of insurance coverage\u00a0you can get\u00a0generally depends on how much an\u00a0individual is willing to pay in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/premium.asp\">premiums</a>\u2014the more someone is willing to pay, the more insurance they\u00a0can obtain. Individuals can usually tailor each policy\u2019s coverage and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deductible.asp\">deductibles</a> to strike the right balance between the amount of coverage and the cost of premiums.\u00a0Premiums can also vary according to where you live.\u00a0\n", "\nPersonal lines insurance won\u2019t cover every risk an individual might face, but they can dramatically reduce their <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liability.asp\">liability</a> for damages\u00a0and the dollar amount they might have to pay out of pocket to remedy an unfortunate situation.\n", "\nIndividuals may be unable to purchase a policy for a particular situation\u00a0because\u00a0they pose too great of a risk to the insurance company. For example, someone with a history of cancer may not be able to purchase <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lifeinsurance.asp\">life insurance</a>. Another example would be a homeowner who wants to buy <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/flood-insurance.asp\">flood insurance</a>, but whose\u00a0house\u00a0is below the flood plain.\u00a0\n", "\nIn some\u00a0cases, high-risk individuals can still purchase insurance, but they will have to pay above-average premiums to compensate the insurer for the extra risk. One common example of this\u00a0is high-risk auto insurance for drivers,\u00a0who've received multiple moving traffic violations over a short time or\u00a0who've\u00a0been at fault in multiple accidents over a short period of time.\n", "\nPersonal lines insurance and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commercial-insurance-lines.asp\">commercial lines insurance</a> each represent about half of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-commercial-lines\">the property and casualty\u00a0insurance market</a>. While personal insurance lines cover individuals, commercial lines provide insurance coverage to businesses and other enterprises.\n", "\nCommercial lines insurance helps protect businesses from any losses they may not be able to cover on their own. This kind of insurance not only covers large commercial enterprises but also protects small businesses against risk. Commercial property insurance, commercial auto insurance, casualty insurance, and medical <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/malpractice-insurance.asp\">malpractice insurance</a> are all kinds of commercial lines insurance.\n", "\nIt isn't always easy to determine how much coverage a business may require under a commercial policy. That's because the needs of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corporation.asp\">corporations</a>\u2014even small businesses\u2014are much more complicated and complex than individuals who seek coverage. For instance, businesses are dependent on their employees and customers. Consider drivers who use company vehicles. The liability for a company may increase because of an employee's driving habits and behaviors while on the road.\n"]}
