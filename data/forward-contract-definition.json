A forward contract can be used for hedging or speculation, although its non-standardized nature makes it particularly apt for <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/trading/hedging-beginners-guide/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hedging</a>.\n", "\nUnlike standard <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futures.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">futures</a> contracts, a forward contract can be customized to a commodity, amount, and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deliverydate.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">delivery date</a>. Commodities traded can be grains, precious metals, natural gas, oil, or even poultry. A forward contract settlement can occur on a cash or delivery basis.\n", "\nForward contracts do not trade on a centralized exchange and are therefore regarded as over-the-counter (OTC) instruments. While their <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otc.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">OTC</a> nature makes it easier to customize terms, the lack of a centralized clearinghouse also gives rise to a higher degree of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/defaultrisk.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">default risk</a>.\n", "\nBoth forward and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futurescontract.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">futures contracts</a> involve the agreement to buy or sell a commodity at a set price in the future. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/06/forwardsandfutures.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">But there are slight differences between the two</a>. While a forward contract does not trade on an exchange, a futures contract does. Settlement for the forward contract takes place at the end of the contract, while the futures contract settles on a daily basis. Most importantly, futures contracts exist as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/contract-theory.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">standardized contracts</a> that are not customized between counterparties.\n", "\nConsider the following example of a forward contract. Assume that an agricultural producer has two million bushels of corn to sell six months from now and is concerned about a potential decline in the price of corn. It thus enters into a forward contract with its <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financialinstitution.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">financial institution</a> to sell two million bushels of corn at a price of $4.30 per bushel in six months, with settlement on a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashbasis.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cash basis</a>.\n", "\nIn six months, the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spotprice.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">spot price</a> of corn has three possibilities:\n", "\nThe market for forward contracts is huge since many of the world\u2019s biggest corporations use it to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedge.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hedge</a> currency and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestraterisk.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">interest rate risks</a>. However, since the details of forward contracts are restricted to the buyer and seller\u2014and are not known to the general public\u2014the size of this market is difficult to estimate.\n", "\nThe large size and unregulated nature of the forward contracts market mean that it may be susceptible to a cascading series of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/default2.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">defaults</a> in the worst-case scenario. While banks and financial corporations mitigate this risk by being very careful in their choice of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/counterparty.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">counterparty</a>, the possibility of large-scale default does exist.\n", "\nAnother risk that arises from the non-standard nature of forward contracts is that they are only settled on the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/settlementdate.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">settlement date</a> and are not marked-to-market like futures.
