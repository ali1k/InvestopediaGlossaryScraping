Excel does all the necessary work for you, arriving at the discount rate you are seeking to find. All you need to do is combine your cash flows, including the initial outlay as well as subsequent inflows, with the IRR function.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\"></span> The IRR function can be found by clicking on the Formulas Insert (<em>fx</em>) icon.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\"></span>\n", "\nHere is a simple example of an IRR analysis with cash flows that are known and annually periodic (one year apart). Assume a company is assessing the profitability of Project X. Project X requires $250,000 in funding and is expected to generate $100,000 in after-tax cash flows the first year and grow by $50,000 for each of the next four years.\n", "\nIn this case, the IRR is 56.72%, which is quite high.\n", "\nExcel also offers two other functions that can be used in IRR calculations: the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/xirr-function-de1242ec-6477-445b-b11b-a303ad9adc9d\" rel=\"nofollow\">XIRR</a>, and the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/mirr-function-b020f038-7492-4fb4-93c1-35c345b53524\" rel=\"nofollow\">MIRR</a>. XIRR is used when the cash flow model does not exactly have annual periodic cash flows.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\"></span> The MIRR is a rate of return measure that also includes the integration of cost of capital as well as the risk-free rate.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\"></span>\n", "\nThe ultimate goal of IRR is to identify the rate of discount, which makes the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/presentvalue.asp\">present value</a>\u00a0of the sum of annual nominal cash inflows equal to the initial net cash outlay for the investment. There are several methods that can be used when seeking to identify an expected return, but IRR is often ideal for analyzing the potential return of a new project that a company is considering undertaking.\n", "\nYou can think of the internal rate of return as the rate of growth an investment is expected to generate annually. Thus, it can be most similar to a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cagr.asp\">compound annual growth rate</a> (CAGR). In reality, an investment will usually not have the same rate of return each year. Usually, the actual rate of return that a given investment ends up generating will differ from its estimated IRR.\n", "\nIn capital planning, one popular scenario for IRR is\u00a0comparing the profitability of establishing\u00a0new operations with that of expanding existing\u00a0ones. For example, an energy company may use IRR in deciding whether to open a new power plant or to renovate and expand a previously existing one. While both projects could add value to the company, it is likely that one will be the more logical decision as prescribed by IRR. \u00a0Note that because IRR does not account for changing discount rates, it's often not adequate for longer-term projects with discount rates that are expected to vary.\n", "\nIRR is also useful for corporations in evaluating stock\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/buyback.asp\">buyback</a>\u00a0programs. Clearly, if a company allocates a substantial amount to a repurchasing its shares, the analysis must show that the company's own stock is a better investment\u2014that is, has a higher IRR\u2014than any other use of the funds, such as creating new outlets or acquiring other companies.\n", "\nIndividuals can also make use of IRR when making financial decisions. For instance, when evaluating different insurance policies using their premiums and death benefits. The general consensus is that policies that have the same premiums and a high IRR are much more desirable. Note that life insurance has a very high IRR in the early years of policy\u2014often more than 1,000%. It then decreases over time. This IRR is very high during the early days of the policy\u00a0because if you made only one monthly premium payment, and then suddenly died your beneficiaries would still get a lump sum benefit.\n", "\nAnother common use of IRR is in analyzing investment returns. In most cases, the advertised return will assume that any interest payments or\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashdividend.asp\">cash dividends</a>\u00a0are re-invested back into the investment. What if you don't want to reinvest\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp\">dividends</a>, but need them as income when paid? And if dividends are not assumed to be reinvested, are they paid out or are they left in cash? What is the assumed return on the cash? IRR and other assumptions are particularly important on instruments like\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/annuity.asp\">annuities</a>, where the cash flows can become complex.\n", "\nFinally, IRR is calculation used for an investment's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/money-weighted-return.asp\">money-weighted rate of return</a> (MWR). The MWR helps determine the rate of return needed to start with the initial investment amount factoring all of the changes to cash flows during the investment period including the sale proceeds.\n", "\nMost IRR analysis will be done in conjunction with a view of a company\u2019s <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wacc.asp\">weighted average cost of capital</a> (WACC) and net present value calculations. IRR is typically a relatively high value, which allows it to arrive at an NPV of zero. Most companies will require an IRR calculation to be above the WACC. WACC is a measure of a firm's\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/costofcapital.asp\">cost of capital</a>\u00a0in which each category of capital is proportionately\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/weighted.asp\">weighted</a>. All sources of capital, including common stock, preferred stock, bonds, and any other long-term debt, are included in a WACC calculation.\n", "\nIn theory, any project with an IRR greater than its cost of capital should be a profitable one. In planning investment projects, firms will often establish a\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/requiredrateofreturn.asp\">required rate of return</a>\u00a0(RRR) to determine the minimum acceptable return percentage that the investment in question must earn in order to be worthwhile. The RRR will be higher than the WACC.\n", "\nAny project with an IRR that exceeds the RRR will likely be deemed a profitable one, though companies will not necessarily pursue a project on this basis alone. Rather, they will likely pursue projects with the highest difference between IRR and RRR, as these likely will be the most profitable.\n", "\nIRR\u00a0may also be compared against prevailing rates of return in the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp\">securities</a>\u00a0market. If a firm can't find any projects with\u00a0IRR\u00a0greater than the returns that can be generated in the financial markets, it may simply choose to invest money into the market. Market returns can also be a factor in setting a required rate of return.\n", "\nThe\u00a0CAGR measures the annual return on an investment over a period of time. The IRR is also an annual\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rateofreturn.asp\">rate of return</a>. However, CAGR\u00a0typically uses only a beginning and ending value to provide an estimated annual rate of return.\n", "\nIRR differs in that it involves multiple periodic cash flows\u2014reflecting the fact that cash inflows and outflows often constantly occur when it comes to investments. Another distinction is that\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/070914/what-are-main-differences-between-compound-annual-growth-rate-cagr-and-internal-rate-return-irr.asp\">CAGR\u00a0is simple</a> enough that it can be calculated easily.\n", "\nCompanies and analysts may also look at the\u00a0return on investment when making <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/111715/return-investment-roi-vs-internal-rate-return-irr.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">capital budgeting decisions</a>.\u00a0ROI tells an investor about the total growth, start to finish, of the investment. It is not an annual rate of return. IRR tells the investor what the\u00a0annual growth rate\u00a0is. The two numbers would normally be the same over the course of one year, but they won't be the same for longer periods of time.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnoninvestment.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Return on investment</a> is the percentage increase or decrease of an investment from beginning to end. It is calculated by taking the difference between the current or expected future value and the original, beginning value, divided by the original value and multiplied by 100.\n", "\nROI figures can be calculated for nearly any activity into which an investment has been made and an outcome can be measured. However, ROI is not necessarily the most helpful for long time frames. It also has limitations in capital budgeting, where the focus is often on periodic cash flows and returns.\n", "\nIRR is generally most ideal for use in analyzing <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalbudgeting.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">capital budgeting</a> projects. It can be misconstrued or misinterpreted if used outside of appropriate scenarios. In the case of positive cash flows followed by negative ones and then by positive ones, the IRR may have multiple values. Moreover, if all\u00a0cash flows have\u00a0the same sign (i.e., the project never turns a profit), then\u00a0no\u00a0discount rate\u00a0will\u00a0produce a zero NPV.\n", "\nWithin its realm of uses, IRR is a very popular metric for estimating a project\u2019s annual return. However, it is not necessarily intended to be used alone. IRR is typically a relatively high value, which allows it to arrive at an NPV of zero. The IRR itself is only a single estimated figure that provides an annual return value based on estimates. Since estimates in both IRR and NPV can differ drastically from actual results, most analysts will choose to combine IRR analysis with scenario analysis. Scenarios can show different possible NPVs based on varying assumptions.\n", "\nAs mentioned, most companies do not rely on IRR and NPV analysis alone. These calculations are usually also studied in conjunction with a company\u2019s <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wacc.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">WACC</a> and a RRR, which provides for further consideration.\n", "\nCompanies usually compare IRR analysis to other tradeoffs. If another project has a similar IRR with less upfront capital or simpler extraneous considerations then a simpler investment may be chosen despite IRRs.\n", "\nIn some cases, issues can also arise when using IRR to compare projects of different lengths. For example, a project of short duration may have a high IRR, making it appear to be an excellent investment. Conversely, a longer project may have a low IRR, earning returns slowly and steadily. The ROI metric can provide some more clarity in these cases, though some managers may not want to wait out the longer time frame.\n", "\nThe internal rate of return rule is a guideline for evaluating whether to proceed with a project or investment. The\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/internal-rate-of-return-rule.asp\">IRR rule</a>\u00a0states that if the internal rate of return on a project or investment is greater than the minimum\u00a0required rate of return, typically the\u00a0cost of capital, then the project or investment can be pursued.\n", "\nConversely, if the IRR on a project or investment is lower than the cost of capital, then the best course of action may be to reject it. Overall, while there are some limitations to IRR, it is an industry standard for analyzing capital budgeting projects.\n", "\nAssume a company is reviewing two projects. Management must decide whether to move forward with one, both, or neither of the projects. Its cost of capital is 10%, The cash flow patterns for each are as follows:\n", "\n<strong>Project A</strong>\n", "\n<strong>Project B</strong>\n", "\nThe company must calculate the IRR for each project.

When you calculate the IRR for an investment, you are effectively estimating the rate of return of that investment after accounting for all its projected cashflows together with the time value of money. When selecting among several alternative investments, the investor would then select the investment with the highest IRR, provided it is above the investor's minimum threshold. The main drawback of IRR is that it is heavily reliant on projections of future cash flows, which are notoriously difficult to predict.\n", "\nAlthough IRR is sometimes referred to informally as a project\u2019s \u201creturn on investment,\u201d it is different from the way most people use that phrase. Often, when people refer to ROI they are simply referring to the percentage return generated from an investment in a given year, or across a stretch of time. But that type of ROI does not capture the same nuances as IRR, and for that reason, IRR is generally preferred by investment professionals.\n", "\nAnother advantage of IRR is that its definition is mathematically precise, whereas the term ROI can mean different things depending on the context or the speaker.\n", "\nWhether an IRR is good or bad will depend on the cost of capital and opportunity cost of the investor. For instance, a real estate investor might pursue a project with a 25% IRR if comparable alternative real estate investments offer a return of, say, 20% or lower.\u00a0This comparison assumes that the riskiness and effort involved in making these difficult investments are roughly the same, however. If the investor can obtain a slightly lower IRR from a project that is considerably less risky or time-consuming, then they might happily accept that lower-IRR project. In general, though, a higher IRR is better than a lower one, all else equal.\n"]}
