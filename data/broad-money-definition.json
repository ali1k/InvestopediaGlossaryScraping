Money supply is measured in different ways. Economists use a capital letter \"M\" followed by a number to refer to the measurement they are using in a given context.\n", "\nThe formula for calculating money supply varies from country to country. Broad money is the broadest measure, encompassing narrow money (such as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cash.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cash</a> and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/checkable-deposits.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">checkable deposits</a>), along with less liquid assets such as certificates of deposit, foreign currencies,\u00a0money market accounts, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketablesecurities.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">marketable securities</a>, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurybill.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Treasury bills</a> and anything else that can be easily converted into cash (but not including company shares).\n", "\nIn the United States, the most common measures of money supply are <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/m1.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">M1</a> and\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/m2.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">M2</a>.

M0 typically includes only the most liquid instruments, such as coins and notes in circulation. At the other end of the scale is M3, which is categorized as the broadest measurement of money.\n", "\nDifferent countries define their measurements of money in slightly different ways. In academic settings, the term broad money is used to avoid misinterpretation. In most cases, broad money means the same as M3, while M0 and M1 usually refer to narrow money.\n", "\nWidening the scope of the total money in circulation comes with several advantages. Above all, it helps policymakers to better grasp potential inflationary trends. Central banks often look at broad money, alongside narrow money, to set <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monetarypolicy.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">monetary policy</a>.\n", "\nEconomists have found close links between money supply, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">inflation</a> and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">interest rates</a>.\u00a0Central banks such as the\u00a0Federal Reserve use lower interest rates to increase the money supply when the goal is to stimulate the economy. Conversely, in an inflationary setting, interest rates are raised and the money supply diminishes, leading to lower prices.\n", "\nIn simple terms, if there is more money available,\u00a0the economy tends to accelerate because businesses have\u00a0easy access to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financing.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">financing</a>. If there is less money in the system, the economy slows\u00a0and prices may drop or stall. In this context, broad money is one of the measures that central bankers use to determine what interventions, if any, they could introduce\u00a0to influence\u00a0the economy.\n"]}
