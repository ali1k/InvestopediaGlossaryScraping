Distributable net income is the maximum amount received by a unitholder or a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beneficiary.asp\">beneficiary</a> that is taxable. This figure is capped to ensure there is no instance of double taxation. Any amount above the DNI is, therefore, tax-free.\n", "\nThe <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irs.asp\">Internal Revenue Service</a> (IRS) considers distributable net income to be an estimate of the economic value that stems from a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/distribution.asp\">distribution</a> to a beneficiary. A distribution is a payment made from a fund\u2014an estate or an income trust\u2014to a beneficiary. DNI gives beneficiaries a reliable income source while minimizing the amount of income taxes paid by the trust.\n", "\nJust like individuals, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/estate.asp\">estates</a> and non-grantor trusts must file income tax returns. Non-grantor trusts are still funded by the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/grantor.asp\">grantor</a>\u2014the person or entity that creates the trust. But this kind of trust functions entirely on its own from the grantor who gives up control of the assets to the trust. The income these trusts report is taxed at either the entity or beneficiary level. Which level is taxed depends on whether it is allocated to the principal amount or to the distributable income, and whether the amount is distributed to the beneficiaries.\u00a0\n", "\nAccording to U.S. tax code, estates\u00a0and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trust.asp\">trusts</a>\u00a0are allowed to deduct the distributable net income or the sum of the trust income required to be distributed\u2014whichever is less\u2014and other amounts \u201cproperly paid or credited or required to be distributed\u201d to beneficiaries to prevent <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/double_taxation.asp\">double taxation</a>\u00a0on income. An income trust recognizes distributable net income as an amount transferred to unitholders. With an estate trust, it\u2019s the amount to be distributed to a beneficiary.\n", "\nAs noted above, when a trust calculates the distributable <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/netincome.asp\">net income</a>, it essentially prevents any instance of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/double_taxation.asp\">double taxation</a> of the funds issued by a trust. The formula to calculate the figure is as follows:\n", "\nAn important point to note here is that in instances where there are <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalloss.asp\">capital losses</a>, that figure replaces the capital gains and is added to the formula instead.\n", "\nIn order to calculate the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxableincome.asp\">taxable income</a>, you need to add the interest income, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp\">dividends</a>, and capital gains, then subtract any fees and tax exemptions. Unlike the DNI calculation, capital gains are added in the taxable income formula while capital losses are subtracted.\n", "\nDistributable net income shouldn't be confused with <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/netincome.asp\">net income</a>\u2014both are two different things. While DNI is the income distributed from a trust to its beneficiary or beneficiaries, net income is used by a business to calculate its <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eps.asp\">earnings per share</a> (EPS)\u2014the total profit of a company divided by the number of outstanding shares of its common stock\u2014and is also referred to as net earnings. Net income appears on a company's balance sheet and helps indicate how profitable it is. In order to calculate its net income, corporations subtract any general and administrative expenses, operating expenses, interest, taxes, other expenses, and the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cogs.asp\">cost of goods sold</a> (COGS) from the total amount of sales.\n", "\nNet income can also be used to refer to an individual's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/take-home-pay.asp\">take-home pay</a>. This is the amount of money a person receives after any deductions are taken from their paychecks such as taxes, health care, disability, insurance, and any other expenses. A person's net income is the opposite of their <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/grossincome.asp\">gross income</a>\u2014the amount they receive before any deductions.\n", "\nHere's an example of how DNI is calculated using a fictional trust we'll call Trust ABC. Let's say Trust ABC reported total income of $40,000. A total of $10,000 of this was interest income, while the remaining $30,000 was derived from dividends. Fees charged by the trust amounted to $3,000, while the trust realized a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalgain.asp\">capital gain</a> of $15,000. An <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exemption.asp\">exemption</a> of $200 applied to the trust.\n", "\nIf we use the formula above, the trust's taxable income is $51,800:\n", "\nWe can then use this taxable income figure to calculate the DNI, which would be $37,000:\n"]}
