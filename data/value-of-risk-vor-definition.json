The goal is generally to make money without being reckless.\n", "\nCompany management knows that if they put the resources available to good use, they stand a decent chance of keeping their jobs and boosting the wealth of investors. Sitting idly means missing out on opportunities or, as some are keen to point out, taking <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profit.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">profits</a> and setting fire to them. The problem is that gain seldom comes without an element of pain. Every decision is accompanied by risk and, therefore, needs to be scrutinized carefully before pursuing.\n", "\nAll activities that a company may undertake, from entering a new market to developing a new product, carry risk.\u00a0How much depends on the type of activity and the likelihood that the company will not be able to recoup costs.

This task sounds relatively straightforward but is actually riddled with complications.\n", "\nCalculations are often based on subjective assumptions, prone to oversight, and subject to change. In an ideal world, potential errors of judgment should be accounted for and every angle covered as objectively as possible by relying on more than one source.\n"]}
