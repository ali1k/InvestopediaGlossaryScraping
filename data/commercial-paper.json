These dealers would thus purchase the notes at a discount from their\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/parvalue.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">par value</a>\u00a0and then pass them on to banks or other investors.

In either case, commercial paper is only issued by firms with high-quality debt ratings. Only these kinds of firms will be able to easily find buyers without having to offer a substantial discount (higher cost) for the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debt-issue.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">debt issue</a>.\n", "\nBecause commercial paper is issued by large institutions, the denominations of the commercial paper offerings are substantial, usually $100,000 or more. Other corporations, financial institutions, wealthy individuals, and money market funds are usually buyers of commercial paper.\n", "\nA major benefit of commercial paper is that it does not need to be registered with the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</a> as long as it matures before nine months, or 270 days, making it a very cost-effective means of financing. Although maturities can go as long as 270 days before coming under the purview of the SEC, maturities for commercial paper average about 30 days, rarely reaching that threshold.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff The proceeds from this type of financing can only be used on current assets, or inventories, and are not allowed to be used on <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixedasset.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fixed assets</a>, such as a new plant, without SEC involvement.\n", "\nThe commercial paper market played a big role in the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-crisis.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">financial crisis</a> that began in 2007. As investors began to doubt the financial health and liquidity of firms such as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lehman-brothers.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lehman Brothers</a>, the commercial paper market froze, and firms were no longer able to access easy and affordable funding. Another effect of the commercial paper market freezing was some money market funds - substantial investors in commercial paper - \"breaking the buck.\" This meant that the affected funds had net asset values under $1, reflecting the diminishing value of their outstanding commercial paper issued by firms of suspect financial health.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"6\"></span>\n", "\nThe Commercial Paper Funding Facility (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commericial-paper-funding-facility-cpff.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CPFF</a>) was subsequently created by the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federal-reserve-bank-of-new-york.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Federal Reserve Bank of New York</a>\u00a0on October 7, 2008, as a result of the credit crunch faced by financial intermediaries in the commercial paper market.

The firm needs $10 million and it offers investors $10.1 million in face value of commercial paper in exchange for $10 million in cash, according to prevailing interest rates. In effect, there would be a $0.1 million interest payment upon maturity of the commercial paper in exchange for the $10 million in cash, equating to an interest rate of 1%. This interest rate can be adjusted for time, contingent on the number of days the commercial paper is outstanding.\n", "\n(For more on this topic, see:<em> <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/070313/introduction-commercial-paper.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Introduction To Commercial Paper.</a></em>)\n"]}
