The general concept is to factor in the worst-case scenario of a firm\u2019s financial future. Uncertain <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liability.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">liabilities</a><strong> </strong>are to be recognized as soon as they are discovered. In contrast, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/revenue.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">revenues</a> can only be recorded when they are assured of being received.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gaap.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Generally Accepted Accounting Principles</a> (GAAP) insist on a number of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accounting-convention.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">accounting conventions </a>being followed to ensure that companies report their financials as accurately as possible. One of these principles, conservatism, requires accountants to show caution, opting for solutions that reflect least favorably on a company\u2019s <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bottomline.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bottom line</a> in situations of uncertainty.\n", "\nAccounting conservatism is not intended to manipulate the dollar amount or timing of reporting financial figures. It is a method of accounting that provides guidance when uncertainty and the need for estimation arise: cases where the accountant has the potential for bias.\n", "\nAccounting conservatism establishes the rules when deciding between two financial reporting alternatives. If an accountant has two solutions to choose from when facing an accounting challenge, the one that yields inferior numbers should be selected.\n", "\nA cautious approach presents the company in a worst-case scenario. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Assets</a> and revenue are intentionally reported at figures potentially understated. Liabilities and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expense.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">expenses</a>, on the other hand, are overstated. If there is uncertainty about incurring a loss, accountants are encouraged to record it and amplify its potential impact. In contrast, if there is a possibility of a gain coming the company's way, they are advised to ignore it until it actually occurs.\n", "\nAccounting conservatism is most stringent in relation to revenue reporting. It requires that revenues are reported in the same period as related expenses were incurred. All information in a transaction must be realizable to be recorded. If a transaction does not result in the exchange of cash or claims to an asset, no revenue may be recognized. The dollar amount must be known to be reported.\n", "\nUnderstating gains and overstating losses means that accounting conservatism will always report lower <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/netincome.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">net income</a>\u00a0and lower financial future benefits. Painting a bleaker picture of a company\u2019s financials actually comes with several benefits.\n", "\nMost obviously, it encourages management to exercise greater care in its decisions. It also means there is more scope for positive surprises, rather than disappointing upsets, which are big drivers of share prices. Like all standardized methodologies, these rules should also make it easier for investors to compare financial results across different industries and time periods.\n", "\nOn the flip side, GAAP rules such as accounting conservatism can often be open to interpretation. That means that some companies will always find ways to manipulate them to their advantage.\n", "\nAnother issue with accounting conservatism is the potential for\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incomeshifting.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">revenue shifting</a>. If a transaction does not meet the requirements to be reported, it must be reported in the following period. This will result in the current period being understated and future periods to be overstated, making it difficult for an organization to track business operations internally.\u00a0\n", "\nAccounting conservatism may be applied to\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/02/060502.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">inventory valuation</a>. When determining the reporting value for inventory, conservatism dictates the lower of\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/historical-cost.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">historical cost</a>\u00a0or replacement cost is the monetary value.\n", "\nEstimations such as uncollectable <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accountsreceivable.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">account receivables</a> (AR) and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/casualty-loss.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">casualty losses</a> also use this principle.
