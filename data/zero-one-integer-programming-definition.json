The term \"mathematical programming\" is connected with the fact that the goal of solving various problems is choosing programs of action. Assigning a simple yes/no value can be a powerful way to establish a linear problem-solving framework to identify inefficiencies.\n", "\nFundamentally, the most basic instructions executed by a computer are binary codes, consisting only of ones and zeros. Those codes are directly translated into the \u201con\u201d and \u201coff\u201d states of the electricity moving through the computer\u2019s physical circuits. In essence, these simple codes form the basis of \u201cmachine language\u201d, the most fundamental variety of programming languages. These on and off positions can also be construed as assigning a \"yes\" or \"no\" to a logical function.\n", "\nOf course, no human would be able to construct modern software programs by explicitly programming ones and zeros. Instead, human programmers must rely on various layers of abstraction that can allow them to articulate their commands in a format that is more intuitive to humans. Specifically, modern programmers issue commands in so-called \u201chigh-level languages\u201d, which utilize intuitive syntax such as whole English words and sentences, as well as logical operators such as \u201cAnd\u201d, \u201cOr\u201d, and\u00a0\u201cElse\u201d that are familiar to everyday usage.\n", "\nUltimately, however, these high-level commands need to be translated into machine language.

For example, a number of variables for each project can be given values that ultimately result in a 1 (yes) or 0 (no) binary decision about whether or not to include the project in a budget. This can be helpful to companies that are unsure about a specific business decision and are looking for a straightforward way to assess the possibilities.\n"]}
