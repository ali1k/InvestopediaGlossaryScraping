The recruits\u00a0are the distributor's \"downline.\" Distributors also make money through direct sales of products to customers. Amway, which sells health, beauty, and\u00a0home care products, is an example of a well-known direct sales company that uses multilevel marketing.\n", "\nMultilevel marketing is a legitimate business strategy, though it is controversial. One problem is pyramid schemes that use money from new recruits to pay people at the top rather than those who perform the work. These schemes involve taking advantage of people by pretending to be engaged in legitimate multilevel or <a class=\"CMY_Link CMY_Valid\" data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/network-marketing.asp\">network marketing</a>. You can spot pyramid schemes by their greater focus on recruitment than on product sales.\n", "\nAn\u00a0issue in determining the legitimacy of a multilevel marketing company is whether it sells\u00a0its products primarily to consumers or to its members who must recruit new members to buy their products. If it is the former, the company is likely a legitimate multilevel marketer. If it is the latter, it could be\u00a0an illegal\u00a0pyramid scheme.\n", "\nThe <a class=\"CMY_Link CMY_Valid\" data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/ftc.asp\">Federal Trade Commission</a>\u00a0(FTC) has been investigating multilevel marketing companies for several decades and has found many with practices that are difficult to determine as legitimate. According to the <a class=\"CMY_Link CMY_Valid\" data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://wfdsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Sales-Report-2017-June-12-2018.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">World Federation of Direct Selling Associates</a>, there were at least 116 million independent representatives among its members worldwide as of 2017. Relatively few earn meaningful incomes from their efforts. To some observers, this reflects the characteristics of a pyramid scheme.\n", "\nHerbalife Nutrition Ltd. is a high-profile, multilevel marketing company that manufactures and distributes weight-loss and nutritional products, with more than 500,000 distributors. Although the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2016/07/herbalife-will-restructure-its-multi-level-marketing-operations\">FTC has investigated Herbalife</a>, it was activist investor William\u00a0Ackman, who shed a national spotlight on the company by shorting $1 billion of the company\u2019s stock in 2012. Ackman accused the company of operating a pyramid scheme and backed his allegations with a bet the company\u2019s stock price would fall under the weight of the scam.\n", "\nIn 2018,\u00a0Ackman\u00a0gave up on his bet.\u00a0As of\u00a0Oct. 27, 2019, the company\u2019s stock price traded at $40\u00a0a share.\n", "\nThere have been multiple lawsuits against\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://company.herbalife.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Herbalife</a>,\u00a0accusing it of misrepresenting its sales practices.\u00a0This included a settlement it reached with the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2016/07/herbalife-will-restructure-its-multi-level-marketing-operations\">FTC in 2016,</a> under which it had to restructure its business. Herbalife argues\u00a0that most of its revenue\u00a0is from product\u00a0sales, not\u00a0recruitment, and it offers members many protections, such as a money-back guarantee, so they will not be stuck with products they could not sell.\n", "\nBroadly speaking, multilevel marketing is a sales structure where members of a company are encouraged to recruit new members. After recruiting a new member, this salesperson will receive a cut of their recruiters sale. At the same time, each salesperson will profit from the sale of a given product.\n", "\nRegularly faced with controversy, multilevel marketing is often compared to pyramid schemes. While some multilevel marketing operations are legal, others have come under investigation. Typically, this will occur when the majority of the operation\u2019s profits funnell up to the top, leaving little for the rest of its members. When an organization focuses primarily on recruitment, rather than selling products, this too may signal that it is operating under a pyramid scheme. Sometimes, members of these schemes will number in the hundreds or even thousands.\u00a0\n", "\nOne example of multilevel marketing is Avon. The company operates under a model where sales are driven through a network of salespeople, through presentations or one-on-one settings in homes or businesses. Like a number of other multilevel marketing businesses, Avon typically does not operate a fixed retail location. The parent company, instead, provides the tools and resources to entrepreneurs to conduct their business at various locations. This type of business model is also referred to as a direct sales model.\u00a0\n"]}
