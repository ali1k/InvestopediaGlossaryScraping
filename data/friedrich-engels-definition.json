His collection of work done with <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/karl-marx.asp\">Karl Marx</a> laid the groundwork for modern communism. Engels\u00a0and Marx wrote and published many articles and books together that attempted to expose the uneven distribution of wealth gained during the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/industrial-revolution.asp\">Industrial Revolution</a>. Their writings\u00a0see\u00a0capitalism as an exploitative system that benefits\u00a0the owners of land, capital,\u00a0and means of production more\u00a0than the workforce. Specifically, Engels and Marx\u00a0claimed that the surplus value created by workers in excess of wages produced\u00a0significant profits for owners of capital\u2014a central theme in\u00a0Engel's contributions to modern communism.\n", "\nFriedrich Engels was born\u00a0on November 20, 1820, in Prussia, or\u00a0what is now Germany. He was the eldest son of a wealthy textile manufacturer Friedrich Sr. and Elisabeth Engels. At an early age, Engels developed a profound sense of cynicism toward major societal institutions like religion. He was opposed to organized religion and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalism.asp\">capitalism</a>, much of which\u00a0was influenced by the writings of German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. Engels helped develop the foundations of the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/labor-theory-of-value.asp\">labor theory of value</a> and exploitation of labor prior to meeting Karl Marx years later.\n", "\nThese unorthodox beliefs placed a significant strain on his relationship with his parents. They grew concerned by his radical ideology\u00a0but still expected he would follow Friedrich Sr.'s footsteps. At 22, Engels was sent to a manufacturing center in Manchester to become well-versed in the family business. It was here that\u00a0Engels grew more engrossed with socialism and met Karl Marx for the first time.\n", "\nTogether, Marx and Engels would produce many pieces of work critiquing capitalism and developing an alternative economic system in communism. Their most famous pieces of work include<em>\u00a0The Condition of the Working Class in England, The Communist Manifesto, </em>and each volume of <em>Das Kapital.\u00a0</em>Engels edited and published\u00a0the fourth volume of\u00a0<em>Kapital\u00a0</em>after Marx's death in 1883. The remainder of Engels' life was spent compiling Marx's unfinished work and putting together thoughts of his own. Engels died of throat cancer in London at age 74.\n", "\nSome of\u00a0Engels'\u00a0most famous work were collaborations with Karl Marx. These\u00a0include:\n"]}
