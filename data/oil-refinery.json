Oil refineries essentially serve as the second stage in the crude oil production process following the actual extraction of crude oil <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/upstream.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">up-stream</a>, and refinery services are considered to be a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/downstream.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">down-stream</a> segment of the oil and gas industry.\n", "\nThe first step in the refining process is distillation, where crude oil is heated at extreme temperatures to separate the different <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hydrocarbon.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hydrocarbons</a>.\n", "\nOil refineries serve an important role in the production of transportation and other fuels. The crude oil components, once separated, can be sold to different industries for a broad range of purposes. Lubricants can be sold to industrial plants immediately after distillation, but other products require more refining before reaching the final user. Major refineries have the capacity to process hundreds of thousand barrels of crude oil daily.\n", "\nIn the industry, the refining process is commonly called the \"downstream\" sector, while raw crude oil production is known as the \"upstream\" sector. The term downstream is associated with the concept that oil is sent down the product value chain to an oil refinery to be processed into fuel. The\u00a0downstream\u00a0stage also includes the actual sale of petroleum products to other businesses, governments or private individuals.\n", "\nAccording to the U.S. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/energy-information-admin.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Energy Information Administration (EIA)</a>, U.S. refineries produce<em>\u2014</em>from a 42-gallon barrel of crude oil<em>\u2014</em>19 to 20\u00a0gallons of motor gasoline, 11 to 12 gallons of distillate fuel (most of which is sold as diesel) and four gallons of jet fuel.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff More than a dozen other petroleum products are also produced in refineries. Petroleum refineries produce liquids the petrochemical industry uses to make a variety of chemicals and plastics.\n", "\nAn oil refinery runs 24 hours a day, 365 days a year and requires a large number of employees. Refineries come offline or stop working for a few weeks each year to undergo seasonal maintenance and other repair work. A refinery can occupy as much land as several hundred football fields. Famous oil refining companies include the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/insights/companies-owned-koch-brothers/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Koch Pipeline Company</a>, and many others.\n", "\nCrack or crack spread is a trading strategy used in\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/optioninvestor/07/energy_market.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">energy futures</a>\u00a0to establish a refining\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margin.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">margin</a>. Crack is one primary indicator of oil refining companies' earnings. Crack allows refining companies to\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedge.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hedge</a>\u00a0against the risks associated with crude oil and those associated with petroleum products. By simultaneously purchasing crude oil futures and selling petroleum product futures, a trader is attempting to establish an artificial position in the refinement of oil created through a spread.\n", "\nThe proportions of petroleum products a refinery produces from crude oil can also affect crack spreads.\u00a0Some of these products include asphalt, aviation fuel, diesel, gasoline and kerosene. In some cases, the proportion produced varies based on\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/demand.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">demand</a>\u00a0from the local market.\u00a0\n", "\nThe mix of products also depends on the kind of crude oil processed. Heavier crude oils are more difficult to refine into lighter products like gasoline. Refineries that use simpler refining processes may be restricted in their\u00a0ability to produce products from heavy crude oil.\n", "\nOil refining is a purely downstream function, although many of the companies doing it have midstream and even upstream production. This integrated approach to oil production allows companies like Exxon (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=xom\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">XOM</a>), Shell (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=rds-a\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">RDS.A</a>)\u00a0and Chevron (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=cvx\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CVX</a>) to take oil from exploration all the way to sale. The refining side of the business is actually hurt by high prices, because demand for many petroleum products, including gas, is price sensitive. However, when oil prices drop, selling value-added products becomes more profitable. Refining pure plays include Marathon Petroleum Corporation (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=mpc\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MPC</a>), CVR Energy Inc. (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"5\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=cvi\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CVI</a>) and Valero Energy Corp (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"6\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=vlo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">VLO</a>).\n", "\nOne area service companies and refiners agree on is\u00a0creating more pipeline capacity and transport. Refiners want more pipeline to keep down the cost of transporting oil by truck or rail. Service companies want more pipeline because they make money in the design and laying stages, and get a steady income from maintenance and testing.\n", "\nOil refineries can be dangerous places to work at times. For example, in 2005 there was an accident at BP's Texas City oil refinery. According to the U.S. Chemical Safety Board, a series of explosions occurred during the restarting of a hydrocarbon isomerization unit. Fifteen workers were killed and 180 others were injured. The explosions occurred when a distillation tower flooded with hydrocarbons and was over-pressurized, causing a geyser-like release from the vent stack.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n"]}
