The COO typically reports directly to the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/ceo.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">chief executive officer </a>(CEO) and is considered to be second in the chain of command.\n", "\nIn some corporations, the COO is known by other terms, such as \"executive vice president of operations,\" \"chief operations officer,\" or \"operations director.\"\n", "\nThe <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/03/022803.asp\">COO</a> mainly focuses on executing the company\u2019s <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/business-plan.asp\">business plan</a>, according to the established business model, while the CEO is more concerned with long-term goals and the broader company outlook. In other words, the CEO devises plans, while the COO implements them.\n", "\nFor instance, when a company experiences a drop in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketshare.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">market share</a>, the CEO might call for increased quality control, in order to fortify its reputation among customers. In this case, the COO might carry out the CEO's mandate by instructing the human resources department to hire more <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quality-control.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">quality control</a> personnel. The COO may also initiate the rollout of new product lines, and may likewise be responsible for production, research and development, and marketing.\n", "\nDepending on the CEO's preference, the COO often handles a company's internal affairs, while the CEO functions as the public face of the company, and thereby handles all outward-facing communication.\n", "\nIn many cases, a COO is specifically chosen to complement the skill sets of the sitting CEO. In an entrepreneurial situation, the COO often has more practical experience than the founding CEO, who may have come up with an excellent concept, but lacks the start-up know-how to launch a company and manage its early stages of development.\n", "\nConsequently, COOs often design operations strategies, communicate policies to employees, and help <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/humanresources.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">human resources</a> (HR) build out core teams.\n", "\nEvery company is different and in a different stage of growth. A new company will have very different needs than a company that has been around for 100 years and has a large market share of its industry. Depending on the company, its needs, the stage of its cycle, and the characteristics of the specific company, it will require a specific type of COO to help it realize its goals.\n", "\nThere are generally seven types of COOs:\n", "\nA COO typically has extensive\u00a0experience within the field in which a given company operates. COOs often work for at least 15 years, climbing the corporate ladder. This slow build helps prepare COOs for their roles, by letting them cultivate extensive experience in the practices, policies, and procedures of their chosen field.\n", "\nAlso, because they're traditionally responsible for directing multiple departments, COOs must be resourceful problem solvers and must possess strong leadership skills. Educationally, COOs typically at a minimum hold bachelor's degrees, while often also holding Master's in Business Administration (MBA) degrees and other certifications.\n", "\nOracle is a technology firm that began in 1977. It sells database software, cloud technology, management systems, and a variety of other products.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\"></span> Oracle had been performing well as a company but then hit a growth cap and couldn't increase annual revenue past $1 billion for a period of time.\n", "\nIn 1992, Larry Ellison, then CEO and now Executive Chairman and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/chief-technology-officer.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CTO</a>, brought in Ray Lane to turn the company's fortunes around. Lane joined as Senior Vice President and President of Oracle USA. He became COO in 1996.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"5\"></span>\n", "\nWhen Lane came on board, he integrated packaged software and high-margin professional service. In this aspect, he was selling two products in one cycle, increasing revenues from one sale. And according to him, because the people providing the professional service were experts on the product, the company could charge a high price for it resulting in a high <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profitmargin.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">margin</a>.\n", "\nIn 1992, Oracle had sales of $1.8 billion and profits of $61.5 million.

The company had been performing well until about 1993 when business started to flounder.\n", "\nThe company's stock fell from $49 to $16 and the CFO had resigned. The problems of the company were due to rapid growth that it could just not keep up with. It had a planned launch of notebook computers that was eventually stopped because of poor production planning. At the time, the company didn't know what product lines its profits and losses were coming from.

The key hire was Mort Topfer. Though he did not have the title of COO, it was Vice Chairman, he did the job of COO and was Dell's mentor. He was the CEO's right-hand man.\n", "\nWhen Topfer came onboard he implemented multi-year planning, opened more affordable factories overseas, encouraged Dell to focus on strategy while he, Topfer, would deal with day-to-day operations, and restructured management.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"7\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff The company, of course, turned around, becoming the powerhouse that it is today.\n", "\nTopfer joined Dell in 1994 and previously worked at Motorola, heading its land mobile products division.

A strong COO will have worked in a variety of positions, particularly in a specific organization, to understand all of the different parts of a business and how they work together. This allows them to pinpoint specific issues and gaps within the organization. Having experience managing people and teams is also imperative to be a COO. In addition, COOs should be great at communication, flexible, and strong leaders.\n", "\nThe salary of a COO will vary greatly depending on a variety of factors.
