Context is important and further digging to see if there is a reasonable explanation behind unusual results is a must.\n", "\nIn general, every ratio tends to overlook something important. That ultimately means that it\u2019s usually necessary to consult several at the same time to get an accurate, more complete picture of how the subject is faring.
