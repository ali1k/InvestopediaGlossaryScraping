Founded in 1908, it admits roughly 930 students to its MBA program per year and regularly ranks among the top business schools in the world.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\"></span><span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\"></span>\n", "\nIn addition to its <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mba.asp\">Master in Business Administration (MBA)</a> program, the school also offers various other doctoral and executive education programs, some of which are provided in collaboration with partnering institutions such as Harvard Law School and the John F. Kennedy School of Government.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\"></span>\n", "\nLike all institutions, the exact standing of Harvard Business School on domestic and international rankings will vary from year to year. Nevertheless, it regularly ranks in the top five graduate business programs internationally and is undoubtedly one of the best known business schools in the world.\n", "\nOne reason for its substantial <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brand-recognition.asp\">brand recognition</a> is the many books and other publications put forward by the Harvard Business School Publishing Corporation (HBSPC).

Of this, roughly $75,000 is attributable to direct tuition fees while the remainder is due to ancillary costs such as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/healthinsurance.asp\">health insurance</a>, course and program materials, rental accommodation, and other living expenses.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"7\"></span>\n", "\nThe Harvard Business School's stated mission is to educate leaders who make a difference in the world.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"8\"></span> Some notable alumni include Salman Khan, founder of the self-education website Khan Academy; Meg Whitman, former president and CEO of eBay; and James D.
