In other words, the money needed to cover current and future retirements is not readily available. This means there is no assurance that future retirees will receive the pensions they were promised or that current retirees will continue to get their previously established distribution amount. An underfunded pension may be contrasted with a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fully-funded.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fully-funded</a> or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/overfunded_pension_plan.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">overfunded</a> pension.\n", "\nA defined-benefit pension plan comes with a guarantee that the promised payments will be received during the employee's retirement years.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff The company invests its pension fund in various assets in order to generate enough income to service the liabilities posed by those guarantees for both current and future retirees.\n", "\nThe <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundedstatus.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">funded status</a> of a pension plan describes how its assets versus its liabilities stack up. \"Underfunded\" means that the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liability.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">liabilities</a>, or the obligations to pay pensions, exceed the assets that have accumulated to fund those payments.\n", "\nPensions can be underfunded for a number of reasons. Interest rate changes and stock market losses can greatly reduce the fund's assets. During an economic slowdown,\u00a0pension plans are susceptible to becoming underfunded.\n", "\nUnder current\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irs.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">IRS</a>\u00a0and accounting rules, pensions can be funded through\u00a0cash contributions and\u00a0by company stock, but the amount of stock that can be contributed is limited to a percentage of the total portfolio.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nCompanies generally contribute as much stock as they can in order to minimize their cash contributions. However,\u00a0this practice is not sound\u00a0portfolio management\u00a0because it results in an overinvestment in the employer's stock. The fund becomes\u00a0overly dependent on the financial health of the employer.\n", "\nIf the pension fund is less than 90 percent\u00a0funded over three consecutive years, or if it is less than 80 percent\u00a0funded for a single year, the company must increase its contribution to the pension portfolio, usually in the form of cash.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nThe need to make this cash payment could materially reduce the company's earnings per share, and therefore its stock price. The reduction in company equity could even trigger defaults on corporate loan agreements. This has serious consequences ranging from higher interest rate requirements to bankruptcy.\n", "\nFiguring out whether a company has an underfunded pension plan can be\u00a0as simple as comparing the fair value of plan assets to the accumulated benefit obligation, which includes the current and future amounts owed to retirees. If the fair value of the plan assets is less than the benefit obligation, there is a\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pensionshortfall.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pension shortfall</a>.\n", "\nThe company is required to disclose this information in a footnote in the company's 10-K annual financial statement.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\u00a0\n", "\nThere is a risk that companies will use overly-optimistic assumptions in estimating their future obligations. Assumptions are necessary when estimating long-term obligations. A company may revise\u00a0its assumptions as time goes on\u00a0to minimize\u00a0a shortfall and avoid the need to contribute additional money to the fund.\n", "\nFor example, a company could assume a long-term rate of return of 9.5 percent, which would increase the funds expected to come from investments and reduce the need for a cash infusion. In real life, the long-term return on stocks is about 7 percent\u00a0and the return on bonds is even lower.\n", "\nThe opposite of an underfunded pension is, of course, an overfunded pension. A fund that has more assets than liabilities is overfunded.\n", "\nActuaries\u00a0calculate the amount of contributions a\u00a0company must pay into a pension\u00a0based on the benefits participants receive or are promised and the estimated growth of the plan\u2019s investments. These contributions are tax-deductible to the employer.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"5\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nHow much money the plan ends up with at the end of the year depends on the amount they paid out to participants and the investment growth they earned on the money. As such, shifts in the market can cause a fund to be either underfunded or overfunded.\n", "\nIt is common for defined benefit plans to become overfunded in the hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars. An overfunded\u00a0pension plan will not result in increased\u00a0participant benefits and cannot be used by the business or its owners.\n"]}
