Established in 1997, it was named after William Roth, a former Delaware Senator.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"12\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nRoth IRAs are similar to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/traditionalira.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">traditional IRAs</a>, with the biggest distinction between the two being how they\u2019re taxed. Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars; the contributions are not tax-deductible. But once you start withdrawing funds, the money is tax-free. Conversely, traditional IRA deposits are generally made with pretax dollars;\u00a0you usually get a tax deduction on your contribution and pay income tax when you withdraw the money from the account during retirement.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"13\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nThis and other key differences make Roth IRAs a better choice than traditional IRAs for some retirement savers.\n", "\nSimilar to other qualified retirement plan accounts, the money invested within the Roth IRA grows tax-free. However, a Roth is less restrictive than other accounts in several ways. Contributions can continue to be made at any age, as long as the account holder has earned income.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff The account holder can maintain the Roth IRA indefinitely; there are no <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/requiredminimumdistribution.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">required minimum distributions</a> (RMDs)\u00a0during their lifetime, as there is with 401(k)s and traditional IRAs.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nA Roth IRA can be funded from a number of sources:\n", "\nAll regular <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/092315/how-much-you-can-contribute-your-ira.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Roth IRA contributions</a> must be made in cash (which includes checks); they can't be in the form of securities or assets. However, a variety of investment options exist within a Roth IRA once the funds are contributed, including\u00a0mutual funds, stocks, bonds,\u00a0ETFs, CDs, and\u00a0money market funds.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nThe IRS limits how much can be deposited in any type of IRA, adjusting the amounts periodically. The contribution limits are the same for traditional and Roth IRAs.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"14\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nA Roth IRA must be established with an institution that has received IRS approval to offer IRAs. These include banks,\u00a0brokerage\u00a0companies, federally insured credit unions, and savings and loan associations.

Some IRA providers have an expansive list of investment options, while others are more restrictive. Almost every institution has a different fee structure for your Roth IRA, which can have a significant impact on your investment returns.\n", "\nYour risk tolerance and investment preferences are going to play a role in choosing a Roth IRA provider. If you plan on being an active investor and making lots of trades, you want to find a provider that has lower trading costs. Certain providers even charge you an account inactivity fee if you leave your investments alone for too long. Some providers have more diverse stock or exchange traded fund offerings than others; it all depends on the type of investments you want in your account.\n", "\nPay attention to the specific account requirements as well. Some providers have higher minimum account balances than others. If you plan on banking with the same institution, see if your Roth IRA account comes with additional banking products.

Therefore, coverage for IRA accounts is not as robust. The\u00a0Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\u00a0(FDIC) still offers insurance protection up to $250,000 for traditional or Roth IRA accounts, but\u00a0account balances\u00a0are combined rather than viewed individually.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"15\"></span><span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"5\"></span>\n", "\nFor example, if the same banking customer has a certificate of deposit held within a traditional IRA with a value of $200,000 and a Roth IRA held in a\u00a0savings account\u00a0with a value of $100,000 at the same institution, the account holder has $50,000 of vulnerable assets without FDIC coverage.\n", "\nThe IRS dictates not only how much money you can deposit in a Roth, but the type of money you can deposit.
