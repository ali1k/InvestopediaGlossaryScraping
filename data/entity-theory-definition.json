Entity theory is based on the idea that all of a company's activities can and will be accounted for independently of the owners' activities under the premise of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/limitedliability.asp\">limited liability</a>, or the separation of ownership from control.\n", "\nUnder entity theory, the owners are not personally responsible for the company's loans and liabilities and so creditors cannot go after owners' personal assets.\n", "\nDespite some criticisms, due in large part to the lack of realism of the relationship in practice, entity theory has been invaluable to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/llc.asp\">limited liability company</a> (LLC) accounting practices and the status of corporations today as juridical persons.\n", "\nIn terms of ownership versus control, limited liability for owners in certain businesses is essential for commerce. To maintain a system that separates owners from company liability, the entity theory establishes a baseline that makes it possible to separate the business finances from that of the owners. The separation of personal and professional <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/business-activities.asp\">business activities</a> is a consistent and significant aspect of commerce around the world. Entity theory is integral to all aspects of commerce.\n", "\nEntity theory is a fundamental aspect of modern accounting.

standing and rights within the business. In relation to accounting, the entity theory keeps obligations, assets, revenues, any expenses, and all other financial aspects of a company separate from the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/personalfinance.asp\">personal finances</a> and financial activities of the company's owners. Thus, the identity of the company and the identity of the company's owners and managers are separate.\n", "\nThis means that corporations are juridical persons in the eyes of the law \u2013 the firm can own assets, property, issue debt (borrow money), enter into contracts, and so on. Firms can also be sued, while the ownership and management remain in the clear personally.\n", "\nThough the basic concept of the entity theory has been circulating since the 19th century, it has failed to gain an overwhelming following. This is partially due to the main and somewhat obvious criticism that has been attached to the theory.\n", "\nUltimately, a company is not itself an independent entity, but a tool or extension of the owners (and/or managers) that is designed to generate a profit. This profit is invariably linked to the owners' wallets. The owners are similarly tied to the company in that they are likely to be significant <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stakeholder.asp\">stakeholders</a> in the firm.\n", "\nThus, for every penny of investment, the owners pour into the company, they expect a return.
