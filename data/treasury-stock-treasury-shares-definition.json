The result is that the total number of outstanding shares on the open market decreases.

It is common for stocks to have a minimal par value, such as $1, but sell and be repurchased for much more.\n", "\nUnder the cash method, at the time of the share repurchase, the treasury stock account is debited to decrease total shareholder's equity. The cash account is credited to record the expenditure of company cash.\u00a0If the treasury stock is later resold, the cash account is increased through a debit and the treasury stock account is decreased, increasing total shareholder's equity, through a credit. In addition, a treasury paid-in capital account is either debited or credited depending on whether the stock was resold at a loss or a gain.\n", "\nUnder the par value method, at the time of share repurchase, the treasury stock account is debited, to decrease total shareholder's equity, in the amount of the par value of the shares being repurchased. The common stock APIC account is also debited to decrease it by the amount originally paid in excess of par value by the shareholders. The cash account is credited in the total amount paid out by the company for the share repurchase. The net amount is included as either a debit or credit to the treasury APIC account, depending on whether the company paid more when repurchasing the stock than the shareholders did originally.\n", "\nABC Company had originally sold 5,000 shares of common stock, with a $1 par value, for $41 per share. It therefore had $5,000 common stock (5,000 shares * $1 par value) and $200,000 common stock APIC (5,000 shares * ($41 - $1 paid in excess of par)) on its balance sheet. ABC Company has excess cash and believes its stock is trading below its intrinsic value. As a result, it decides to repurchase 1,000 shares of its stock at $50 for a total value of $50,000.\n", "\nThe repurchase creates a treasury stock contra equity account. Under the cash method, the treasury account would be debited for $50,000 and cash credited for $50,000. Under the par value method, treasury stock would be debited for $1,000 (1,000 shares * $1 par value), common stock APIC would be debited for $49,000 (1,000 shares * ($50 repurchase price - $1 par value)), and cash would be credited for $50,000.\n", "\nIn both the cash method and the par value method, the total shareholder's equity is decreased by $50,000. Assume the total sum of ABC Company's equity accounts including common stock, APIC, and retained earnings was $500,000 prior to the share <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/buyback.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">buyback</a>. The repurchase brings the total shareholder's equity down to $450,000.\n", "\nTreasury stock can be retired or held for resale in the open market. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/retiredsecurities.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Retired shares</a> are permanently canceled and cannot be reissued later. Once retired, the shares are no longer listed as treasury stock on a company's financial statements. Non-retired treasury shares can be reissued through stock dividends, employee compensation, or a capital raising.\n"]}
