Grunt work can also refer to jobs that either lack glamour and prestige or are boring and repetitive. In the context of the finance industry, grunt work could entail combing through a company's financial records, looking for positive and negative developments, or analyzing historical trading data in the hope of finding the perfect\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stop-limitorder.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">stop-limit order</a>\u00a0points.\n", "\nGrunt work, despite its lowly status, is often an essential component of climbing the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corporate-ladder.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">career ladder</a>. Some banks and firms have their own hierarchies, but <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/professionals/102915/hierarchy-investment-bank.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">financial careers on Wall Street typically follow a path</a> similar to the following:\n", "\nGrunt work often includes coordinating presentations, compiling <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/data-analytics.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">analytical data</a>, and administrative duties. For example, an analyst will likely be responsible for coordinating the publication of pitch books and marketing presentations for existing and prospective clients. Analytical work is Excel-heavy, including <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financialmodeling.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">financial modeling</a>, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valuation.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">valuation</a>, and credit analysis. Administrative work likely includes scheduling, coordinating meetings, and making travel arrangements.\u00a0\n", "\nAfter the role of analyst, the next role in the traditional career progression of a finance professional is associate. Associates are either recruited directly out of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mba.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MBA</a> programs or are analysts that have been promoted after two years at the firm. The associate role is similar to the analyst role, with the additional responsibility of serving as a liaison between junior- and senior-level personnel.\n", "\nIn some instances, they may have opportunities to work directly with clients as well. Associates work closely with analysts, given their familiarity with and expectations for the role. Associates review the work of analysts, particularly when those individuals in the analyst role are working on any <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/client-facing.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">client-facing</a> materials or analytical work.\n", "\nSenior-level personnel\u2013starting with vice presidents and moving on to directors and managing directors\u2013assume additional responsibilities as they climb the career ladder and become decision-makers. Seniors prospect for deals and maintain client relationships, in addition to knowing how economic shifts and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market-dynamics.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">market dynamics</a> can impact their <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/industry.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">industry</a> at an expert level.

In an effort to attract and retain top talent, which has become a challenge in recent years, many firms have been quickening the pace of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/promotion.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">promotion</a>. Also, firms have been utilizing technology to reduce some of the labor-intensive grunt work typically associated with analyst- and associate-level positions, which often include long hours under deadline pressure.\u00a0\n", "\nHowever, it could be said that for those just starting out in a career in the finance industry, grunt work is actually highly relevant because you need to master the grunt work if you are ever to be trusted with the higher-level, more complex tasks. Grunt work is a way for analysts and associates to demonstrate their competency by showing those in senior-level positions that they can effectively do the smaller or less important tasks first.\n"]}
