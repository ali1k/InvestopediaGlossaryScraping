By contrast, a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/definedbenefitpensionplan.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">defined-benefit plan</a> provides the plan holder with predetermined payments upon retirement that do not change and which are based on an eligibility formula rather than on investment returns.\n", "\nVariable-benefit plans shift investment risk from the employer to the employee. It is possible that the employee will end up with less money from a variable-benefit plan if he makes poor investment choices. However, he also has the power to make superior investment choices and end up with better benefits. Therefore, the ability of the employee to make smart investment decisions is critical in variable-benefit plans.\n", "\nPeople have been investing in financial markets in order to provide for their retirement for as long as the history of capitalism itself. The American Express Company first offered its employees a pension plan in 1875, establishing the first private pension plan in the United States.\n", "\nAs Americans\u2019 life expectancy rose throughout the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the problem\u00a0of how to provide for the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/retirement.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">retirement</a> of members of the growing <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/upper-class.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">middle class</a> became of increasing importance. Congress sought to encourage the growth of private pensions by making contributions to such accounts tax-deductible in the\u00a01920s. By 1929, there were 397 private-sector plans extant in the United States and Canada.\n", "\nThe growth of pension plans exploded following World War Two, when <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/labor-union.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">unions</a> began to strike in large numbers, demanding the provision of pensions. From the end of World War Two to about 1980, defined-benefit pensions, or a pension in which a worker is guaranteed a predetermined set of benefits until death, were a major form of retirement security for American workers.\n", "\nBut these sorts of pensions put great pressure on American companies, which were facing increased competition from foreign rivals, and from <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholder.asp\">shareholders</a> who were demanding maximum returns. This led the private sector to rely more on variable-benefit plans, in which the contribution from the company is defined, but the actual payout depends on how the pension investments perform.\n", "\nSince the early 1980s, workers' access to defined-benefit plans has declined.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\"></span> According to the National Compensation Survey conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2020, only 20% of workers participated in defined-benefit plans.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\"></span> By comparison, 60% of workers participated in variable-benefit (defined-contribution) plans.\n"]}
