A significant part of\u00a0OTPPB's mandate at its inception was to create a more sophisticated and diversified investment regime.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff At the same time, the plan\u2019s obligations to current and future retirees require it to maintain a conservative approach to risk.\n", "\nLike any pension fund, OTPPB\u2019s fundamental goal is to manage funding risk, the risk that assets and returns fail to satisfy the plan\u2019s obligations to its participants. OTPPB now manages a variety of assets, including international equities, commodities, natural resources, and real estate.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"5\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nOTPPB was an early pioneer in the development of a pension management style known as the Canadian Model.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"5\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff Other pension funds such as the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System (OMERS) have followed suit, and Canadian plans have achieved a global reputation as leaders in effective and responsible management.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"6\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff The OTPPB describes the pillars of this system as independence, strong internal <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corporategovernance.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">governance</a> starting with board members, direct investment and a focus on retaining talent.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"5\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nIn practice, the first step in this innovation was to bring investment management almost entirely in-house. This often means that the board will enter into deals directly rather than use a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/privateequity.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">private equity</a> firm as an intermediary. Managing investments directly allows OTPPB to keep costs low and to keep to a long-term approach that can conflict with the investment strategies of non-pension funds.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"8\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nOTPPB has also achieved success by maintaining a board that has avoided political concerns that have often struck other public pension institutions. Board members have tended to come from finance backgrounds rather than political or public service.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"9\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff Large funds in the United States, by contrast, tend to have boards drawn from a wider range of backgrounds, often leading to conflicts in oversight.\n", "\nFinally, OTPPB\u2019s version of the Canadian Model includes executive pay that is out of scale with its counterparts in the United States. OTPPB executive pay is competitive with <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/baystreet.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bay Street</a>, the investment community in Toronto, and is structured to reward long-term returns.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"12\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff Pension managers in the United States, for comparison, tend to receive compensation far below the norms of Wall Street.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"11\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n"]}
