The equity component of tier-1 capital has to have at least 4.5% of RWAs. The tier 1 capital ratio has to be at least 6%.\n", "\nBasel III also introduced a minimum leverage ratio\u2014with tier 1 capital, it must be at least 3% of the total assets\u2014and more for global systemically important banks that are too big to fail. The Basel III rules have yet to be finalized due to an impasse between the U.S. and Europe.\n", "\nA firm's\u00a0risk-weighted assets\u00a0include all assets that the firm holds that are systematically weighted for credit risk. Central banks typically develop the weighting scale for different\u00a0asset classes; cash and government securities carry zero risk, while a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/first_mortgage.asp\">mortgage loan</a> or car loan would carry more risk.

Consequently, its tier 1 capital ratio is 10% ($5 million/$50 million), and it is considered to be well-capitalized compared to the minimum requirement.\n", "\nOn the other hand, bank DEF has retained earnings of $600,000 and stockholders' equity of $400,000. Thus, its tier 1 capital is $1 million. Bank DEF has risk-weighted assets of $25 million. Therefore, bank DEF's tier 1 capital ratio is 4% ($1 million/$25 million), which is undercapitalized because it is below the minimum tier 1 capital ratio under Basel III.\n", "\nBank GHI has tier 1 capital of $5 million and risk-weighted assets of $83.33 million. Consequently, bank GHI's tier 1 capital ratio is 6% ($5 million/$83.33 million), which is considered to be adequately capitalized because it is equal to the minimum tier 1 capital ratio.\n", "\nThe <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tier-1-leverage-ratio.asp\">tier 1 leverage ratio</a> is the relationship between a banking organization's core capital and its total assets. The tier 1 leverage ratio is calculated by dividing tier 1 capital by a bank's average total consolidated assets and certain\u00a0off-balance sheet exposures. Similarly to the tier 1 capital ratio, the tier 1 leverage ratio is used as a tool by central monetary authorities to ensure the capital adequacy of banks and to place constraints on the degree to which a financial company can leverage its capital base but does not use risk-weighted assets in the denominator.\n"]}
