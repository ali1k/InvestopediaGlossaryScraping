It prohibits\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditor.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">creditors</a>\u00a0and lenders\u00a0from considering consumers\u2019 race, color, national origin, sex/gender, religion,\u00a0marital status, age\u00a0(as long as they\u2019re old enough to sign a contract)\u00a0or\u00a0their receipt of\u00a0public assistance\u00a0for any aspect of lending\u2014from approving the application to setting terms of the loan, such as interest rate or fees.\u00a0\n", "\nThe law applies to any organization that extends credit, including banks, small loan and finance companies, retail and department stores, credit card companies, and credit unions. It also applies to anyone involved in the decision to grant credit or set its terms\u2014for example, real estate brokers who arrange financing.\u00a0\n", "\nThe ECOA covers various types of credit, including personal loans, credit cards, home loans, student loans, car loans, small business loans and loan modifications.\n", "\nIn July 2020, the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-cfpb.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)</a>, which takes the lead in supervising compliance and enforcing the ECOA, issued a\u00a0Request for Information<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\u00a0soliciting public comments to identify opportunities for improving what ECOA does to ensure nondiscriminatory access to credit. \u201cClear standards help protect African Americans and other minorities,\u201d\u00a0stated Kathleen L.

While these questions cannot be part of the analysis for approval\u2014and answering them is optional\u2014this information does help federal agencies enforce anti-discrimination laws.\n", "\nAnother aspect of the ECOA allows each spouse in a marriage to have their own credit history in their own name. That being said, if a borrower has any joint accounts with their spouse, these accounts will appear on both\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditreport.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">credit reports</a>, so a spouse\u2019s financial behavior can still have a positive or negative impact on an individual borrower\u2019s credit score.\n", "\nWhile the ECOA prohibits lenders from basing their decisions on marital status, some loans, such as mortgages, might require a borrower to disclose that they are making required\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/alimony.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">alimony</a>\u00a0or child support payments. Also, if a borrower receives child support or alimony, and it represents a significant source of income, they might need to disclose it to qualify for a\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/loan.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">loan</a>. A borrower could be denied a loan if, for example, their child support payments combined with their other financial obligations mean that they don\u2019t have enough money to repay the loan as required. However, a borrower cannot be denied a loan simply because they are divorced.\n", "\nWhen you apply for a loan or credit card, the ECOA gives you certain rights.\n", "\nOften, credit discrimination is not obvious, which makes it hard to spot.\u00a0CFPB\u00a0advises consumers to be alert to these red flags of ECOA violations:\u00a0<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"5\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nIf you feel you\u2019ve been treated unfairly in a credit application, there are several steps you can take.\u00a0\n", "\nLenders found in violation of the ECOA can potentially face class-action lawsuits by the Department of Justice (DOJ) if the DOJ or any affiliate agencies recognize a pattern of discrimination.\n", "\nThe\u00a0Consumer Financial Protection Bureau<strong>\u00a0</strong>seeks to enforce ECOA, along with other federal agencies, such as the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/frb.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Federal Reserve Board</a>, the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/office-comptroller-currency-occ.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Office of the Comptroller of the Currency</a>\u00a0(OCC), the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fdic.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</a>\u00a0(FDIC), and the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/ncua.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">National Credit Union Administration</a>\u00a0(NCUA).
