A reinsurer is a company that provides financial protection to insurance companies; a ceding company is an insurance\u00a0company\u00a0that transfers the insurance portfolio to a reinsurer.\n", "\nExcess of loss reinsurance is a form of non-proportional <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/081716/facultative-vs-treaty-reinsurance-differences-and-examples.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reinsurance</a>. Non-proportional reinsurance is based on loss retention. With non-proportional reinsurance, the ceding company agrees to accept all losses up a predetermined level.\n", "\nDepending on the language of the contract, excess of loss reinsurance can apply to either\u00a0all loss events during the policy period or\u00a0losses in aggregate. Treaties may also use bands of losses that are reduced with each claim.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treaty-reinsurance.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Treaty</a> or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/facultative-reinsurance.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">facultative reinsurance</a> contracts often specify a limit in losses for which\u00a0the reinsurer will be responsible. This limit is agreed to in the reinsurance contract; it protects the reinsurance company from dealing with <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unlimited-liability.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">unlimited liability</a>. In this way, treaty and facultative reinsurance contracts are\u00a0similar to a standard insurance contract, which provides coverage up to a specific amount. While this is beneficial to the reinsurer, it places the onus on the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/010715/worlds-top-10-insurance-companies.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">insurance company</a> to reduce losses.\n", "\nExcess of loss reinsurance takes a different approach than treaty or facultative reinsurance. The reinsurance company is held responsible for the total amount of losses above a certain limit. For example, a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reinsurance.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reinsurance contract</a> with an excess of loss provision may indicate that the reinsurer is responsible for losses over $500,000. In this case, if aggregate losses amount to $600,000, then the reinsurer will be responsible for $100,000.\n", "\nExcess of loss reinsurance can also work in a slightly different way.\u00a0Rather than require the reinsurer to be responsible for all losses over a certain amount, the contract\u00a0may instead indicate that the reinsurer is responsible for a percentage of losses over that threshold. This means that the ceding company and the reinsurer will share aggregate losses.\n", "\nFor example, a reinsurance contract with an excess of loss provision may indicate that the reinsurer is responsible for 50% of the losses over $500,000. In this case, if aggregate losses amount to $600,000, the reinsurer will be responsible for $50,000 and the ceding company will be responsible for $50,000.\n", "\nBy\u00a0covering itself against excessive losses, an excess of loss reinsurance policy gives the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reinsurance-ceded.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ceding insurer more security</a> for its equity and solvency. It can also provide more stability when\u00a0unusual or\u00a0major events occur.\n", "\nReinsurance also allows an insurer\u00a0to\u00a0underwrite policies that cover\u00a0a larger volume of risks without excessively raising the\u00a0costs of\u00a0covering their solvency margins\u2013the\u00a0amount by which the assets of the insurance company, at fair values, are considered to exceed its <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liability.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">liabilities</a> and other comparable commitments.\u00a0In fact, reinsurance makes substantial liquid assets available for insurers in case of exceptional losses.\n"]}
