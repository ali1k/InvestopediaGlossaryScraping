Imputed interest is important for discount bonds, such as zero-coupon bonds\u00a0and other securities sold below face value and mature <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/at-par.asp\">at par</a>. The IRS uses an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accretive.asp\">accretive</a> method when calculating the imputed interest on Treasury bonds and has <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/applicablefederalrate.asp\">applicable federal rates</a> that set a minimum interest rate in relation to imputed interest and original issue discount rules.\n", "\nImputed interest may apply to loans among family and friends. For example, a mother loans her son $50,000 with no interest charges. The applicable short-term federal rate is 2 percent, so the son should pay his mother $1,000 annually in interest. The IRS\u00a0assumes the mother collects this amount from her son and lists it on her tax return as interest income\u00a0even though she did not collect the funds.\n", "\nBecause there were many low-interest or interest-free loans that went untaxed, the IRS established applicable federal rates through the Tax Act of 1984. The <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/applicablefederalrate.asp\">AFR</a> determines the lowest interest that one may charge\u00a0on loans below a specific interest rate threshold and considers the amount of potential income generated from the interest rate as imputed income. Because of the creation of AFR, the IRS may collect tax revenue from loans that otherwise untaxed.\n", "\nWhen calculating imputed interest on a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/z/zero-couponbond.asp\">zero-coupon bond</a>, an investor first determines the bond\u2019s <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/y/yieldtomaturity.asp\">yield to maturity</a>. Assuming the accrual period is one year, the investor divides the face value of the bond by the price paid when it, he, or she\u00a0purchased it.\u00a0The investor\u00a0then increases the value by a power equal to one divided by the number of accrual periods before the bond matures. The investor reduces the number by one and multiplies by the number of accrual periods in one year to determine the zero-coupon bond\u2019s YTM.\n", "\nBecause the adjusted purchase price of a zero-coupon bond is initially equal to its purchase price when issued, the accrued interest gained over each accrual period adds to the adjusted purchase price. The accrued interest is the initial adjusted purchase price multiplied by the YTM. This value is the imputed interest for the period.\n", "\nImputed interest is important for determining pension payouts. For example, when an employee retires from a company where they\u00a0were a member of a pension plan, the company may offer the retiree a lump sum of the $500,000 set aside for them under the plan, or they may receive $5,000 a year in benefits. Assuming the applicable short-term federal rate is 2 percent, the retiree needs to determine whether they could find\u00a0better imputed interest in another market by taking the lump sum and purchasing a\u00a0higher-yield annuity.\n"]}
