The balance sheet formula is: assets, minus liabilities, equals stockholders' equity, and stockholders' equity includes retained earnings, or the sum of a company's net income, minus cash dividends since inception.\n", "\nCompanies raise capital to buy assets and use those assets to generate sales or invest in new projects with a positive expected return. A well-managed company maximizes the use of its assets so that the firm can operate with a smaller investment in assets.\n", "\nAssume, for example, a plumbing company uses a truck and equipment to complete residential work, and the total cost of these assets is $50,000. The more sales the plumbing firm can generate using the truck and the equipment, the more shareholder value the business creates. Valuable companies are those that can increase earnings with the same dollar amount of assets.\n", "\nGenerating sufficient cash inflows to operate the business is also an important indicator of shareholder value because the company can operate and increase sales without the need to borrow money or issue more stock. Firms can increase cash flow by quickly converting inventory and accounts receivable into cash collections.\n", "\nThe rate of cash collection is measured by <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/turnoverratio.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">turnover ratios</a>, and companies attempt to increase sales without the need to carry more inventory or increase the average dollar amount of receivables. A high rate of both inventory turnover and accounts-receivable turnover increases\u00a0shareholder value.\n", "\nIf management makes decisions that increase net income each year, the company can either pay a larger <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashdividend.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cash dividend</a> or retain earnings for use in the business.

When a company can increase earnings, the ratio increases and investors view the company as more valuable.\n", "\nIt is commonly understood that corporate directors and management have a duty to maximize shareholder value, especially for publicly traded companies. However, legal rulings suggest that this common wisdom is, in fact, a practical myth\u2014there is actually no legal duty to maximize profits in the management of a corporation.\n", "\nThe idea can be traced in large part to the oversize\u00a0effects of a single outdated and widely misunderstood ruling\u00a0by the Michigan Supreme Court's 1919 decision in <em>Dodge v. Ford Motor Co.</em>, which was about the legal duty of a controlling majority shareholder with respect to a minority shareholder and not about maximizing shareholder value. Legal and organizational scholars such as Lynn Stout and Jean-Philippe Rob\u00e9 have elaborated on this myth at length.\n"]}
