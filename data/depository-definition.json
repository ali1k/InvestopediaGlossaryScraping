A depository can be an organization, bank, or institution that holds <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">securities</a> and assists in the trading of securities. A depository provides security and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">liquidity</a> in the market, uses money deposited for safekeeping to lend to others, invests in other securities, and offers a funds <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/transfer.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">transfer</a> system. A depository must return the deposit in the same condition upon request.\n", "\nAs mentioned above, depositories are buildings, offices, and warehouses that allow consumers and businesses to deposit money, securities, and other valuable <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">assets</a> for safekeeping. Depositories may include banks, safehouses, vaults, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financialinstitution.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">financial institutions</a>, and other organizations.\n", "\nDepositories serve multiple purposes for the general public. First, they eliminate the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risk.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">risk</a> of holding physical assets to the owner. For instance, banks other financial institutions give consumers a place to deposit money into time and demand deposit accounts. A <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/timedeposit.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">time deposit</a> is an interest-bearing account and has a specific date of maturity such as a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/certificateofdeposit.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">certificate of deposit (CD)</a>, while a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/demanddeposit.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">demand deposit</a> account holds funds until they need to be withdrawn such as a checking or savings account. Deposits can also come in the form of securities such as stocks or bonds. When these assets are deposited, the institution holds the securities in electronic form also known as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"5\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bookentrysecurities.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">book-entry form</a>, or in dematerialized or paper format such as a physical certificate.\n", "\nThese organizations also help create liquidity in the market. Customers give their money to a financial institution with the belief the company holds it and gives it back when the customer wants it back. These institutions accept customers' money and pay <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interest.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">interest</a> on their deposits over time. While holding the customers' money, the institutions lend it to others in the form of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortgage.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mortgage</a> or business loans, generating more interest on the money than the interest paid to customers.\n", "\nTransferring the ownership of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shares.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">shares</a> from one investor's account to another account when a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trade.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">trade</a> is executed is one of the primary functions of a depository. This helps reduce the paperwork for executing a trade and speeds up the transfer process. Another function of a depository is the elimination of risk of holding the securities in physical form such as theft, loss, fraud, damage, or delay in deliveries.\n", "\nAn investor who wants to purchase precious metals can purchase them in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bullion.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">physical bullion</a> or paper form.

The main source of funding for these institutions is through deposits from customers. Customer deposits and accounts are insured by the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fdic.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)</a> up to certain limits.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nCredit unions are nonprofit companies highly focused on customer services. Customers make deposits into a credit union account, which is similar to buying shares in that credit union.

Customers deposit money into an account, which buys shares in the company. For example, a savings institution may approve 71,000 mortgage loans, 714 real estate loans, 340,000 credit cards, and 252,000 auto and personal consumer loans while earning interest on all these products during a single fiscal year.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commercialbank.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Commercial banks</a> are for-profit companies and are the largest type of depository institutions.

A repository is where things are kept for safekeeping. But unlike a depository, the items kept in a repository are generally abstract such as knowledge.
