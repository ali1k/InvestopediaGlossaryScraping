Each week\u2019s reports include indices tracking changes in fixed-rate, adjustable, conventional, and governmental loans and refinances.\n", "\nIt is important to note that the Weekly Mortgage Survey primarily tracks data on the mortgage applications submitted each week, as opposed to mortgage loan applications that close.\n", "\nSince the launch of the Weekly Mortgage Applications Survey in 1990, its indices have served as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leadingindicator.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">leading indicators</a> in the housing and mortgage finance industries. While most of the stakeholders with an interest in the trends charted by the Weekly Application Survey may be focused on recent trends and near-term forecasting, the available data also provide historical perspectives on macro-trends in these industries.\n", "\nWhile the Weekly Applications Survey has only been in operation since 1990, the Mortgage Bankers Association has existed since 1914. Initially known as the Farm Mortgage Bankers Association of America, the organization convened to provide loans for farmland. In 1926, the organization changed its name to Mortgage Bankers Association of America.\n", "\nWhile anyone working in the real estate finance industry is eligible to join, MBA membership is largely composed of independent mortgage banks. The remainder of the membership comprises commercial and community banks, credit unions, mortgage servicers, insurance and title companies, and more. The Weekly Applications Survey aggregates member-reported data for its weekly reports.\n", "\nEach Wednesday, the MBA publishes the results of the previous week\u2019s survey with comparative data analysis to chart market trends. Real estate market stakeholders pay particular attention to two of these indices: the MBA Refinance Index and the MBA Purchase Index.\n", "\nThe <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mba-refinance-index.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MBA Refinance Index</a> tracks the number of refinance applications submitted, reporting the week\u2019s total alongside the percentage change from the prior week and the four-week moving average of the index.\n", "\nThis tool can be useful in forecasting mortgage activity. Some analysts look to refinancing data to predict other forms of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumer-spending.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">consumer spending</a>, while mortgage investors look to this index for trends that will impact them, especially as a wave of refinancing can decrease payments over time to mortgage investors.\n", "\nSimilarly, the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mba-purchase-index.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MBA Purchase Index</a> counts the number of new home loan applications submitted each week. These figures are useful for builders and developers in forecasting new housing construction. Mortgage investors can also look to this index for market trend indicators, such as mortgage prepayment.\n"]}
