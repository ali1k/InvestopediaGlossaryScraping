Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, this use of the term\u00a0has largely evolved.\n", "\nMore recently, the term\u00a0has been used to describe a developed and industrialized country characterized by political stability, democracy, the rule of law, a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalism.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">capitalist</a> economy, economic stability, and a high <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standard-of-living.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">standard of living</a>.\n", "\nVarious metrics have been used to define first-world nations, including <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gdp.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">gross domestic product</a> (GDP), <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gnp.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">gross national product</a> (GNP), and literacy rates. The <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/human-development-index-hdi.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Human Development Index</a> is also a good indicator of determining first-world countries.\n", "\nFirst-world\u00a0countries tend to have stable <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currency.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">currencies</a> and robust <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-market.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">financial markets</a>, making them attractive to investors from all over the Earth. Examples of first-world countries include the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and some Western European countries.\n", "\nThe ways that\u00a0first-world\u00a0nations are defined can vary by perspective. For example, a first-world nation might be described as aligned or amicable with western countries, highly industrialized, with comparatively low poverty, and high accessibility to modern resources and infrastructure.\n", "\nThere is some controversy regarding the use of the term \"first world\"\u00a0to describe modernized, democratic countries in comparison with <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/ldc.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">developing nations</a> and those with political regimes that do not align with western nations. There can be a tendency toward using the phrase as a way to rank some nations above others in terms of geopolitical significance. Such references can lead to divisive tension in international relations, especially as developing nations seek to negotiate with so-called first-world countries or appeal to the international community for support of their causes.\n", "\nIt is not uncommon for first-world nations to press for international policies, especially from an economic perspective, that will favor their industries and trade to protect or enhance their wealth and stability. This can include efforts to influence decisions made in such forums as the United Nations or the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wto.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">World Trade Organization</a> (WTO).\n", "\nDesignation as a first-world nation does not necessarily mean a country has local access to certain luxuries or resources that are in demand. For example, oil production is a staple industry in many countries that historically have not been regarded as first-world nations. Brazil, for instance, contributes substantial amounts of oil to the overall world supply, along with other forms of production;\u00a0however, the country is recognized as a developing, industrialized state more than as a first-world nation.\n", "\nThere is an argument to be made that the model of dividing up nations on Earth into three worlds represents an archaic and antiquated perspective.\n", "\nSince the end of the Cold War, the United States has become the world's only superpower and an increasing number of countries have embraced or are in the process of adopting American-style democracy and capitalism. These <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/insights/worlds-top-economies/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">countries</a> are neither abysmally poor nor rich. Rule of law and democracy are their defining features. As such, it would be counterintuitive to describe them with the pejorative term of \"third world\" countries. Examples of these types of countries include Brazil and India.\n", "\nSeveral first-world countries also have poverty-stricken regions, areas with conditions comparable to those used to describe third-world or developing countries. For example, residents of rural United States live in deep <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/poverty.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">poverty</a>. Even certain blocks in large cities, such as the South Side in Chicago, are home to extremely poor people.\n", "\nThe former definition of <em>first world</em> as a country not aligned with the United States has also led to some rich countries being shunted as developing countries. Oil-rich Saudi Arabia, which has a higher <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/income-per-capita.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">per capita income</a> than first-world country Turkey, is slotted as a developing country.\n", "\nWhile highly subjective, first world is a term that consists of countries that may have the following characteristics: stable democracies, high standards of living, capitalist economies, and economic stability. Other measures that may be used to indicate first world countries include gross domestic product or literacy rates. Broadly speaking, countries that may be considered first world include the United States, Japan, Canada, and Australia, among others.\n", "\nWhile there is no universal way to define a first world country, often they are characterized as industrialized and democratic countries. This is typically accompanied by stable currencies, sound financial markets, and modern infrastructure. Due to these factors, first world countries often attract foreign direct investment and capital inflows.\n", "\nFirst world is a problematic term because it is outdated. First coined in 1991 during the Cold War, it consisted of countries that were aligned with the United States, and other westernized countries as opposed to countries that aligned with the former-Soviet Union. Because the economic indicators used to define the first world vary by their perspective, first world can represent an opaque concept of a country's economic stature. For instance, despite Saudi Arabia having per capita income that is nearly equal to Portugal, it is often considered a second world nation.\n"]}
