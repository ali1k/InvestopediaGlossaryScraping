C2C marketing has soared in popularity with the arrival of the Internet and\u00a0companies such as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/042815/how-ebay-makes-its-money-ebay.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">eBay</a>, Etsy, and Craigslist.\n", "\nC2C represents a market environment where one customer purchases goods from another customer using a third-party business or platform to facilitate the transaction. C2C companies are a type of business model that emerged with <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ecommerce.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">e-commerce</a> technology and the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sharing-economy.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sharing economy</a>.\n", "\nCustomers benefit from the competition for products and often find items that are\u00a0difficult to locate elsewhere. Also, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margin.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">margins</a> can be higher than traditional pricing methods for sellers because there are minimal costs due to the absence of retailers or wholesalers. C2C sites are convenient because there is no need to visit a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brickandmortar.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">brick-and-mortar</a> store.

Craigslist not only provides a platform for buying, selling, and trading products but posts monthly classified ads, such as employment opportunities and property listings. This platform requires the seller to deliver items directly to the buyer in person.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/012716/etsy-how-its-fared-its-2015-ipo-etsy.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Etsy</a> allows company owners to create their custom website on which to market their products to consumers. The C2C site offers guidance and tools for growing a business that ranges in price according to a company's stage of development. There's also a \"Sell on Etsy\" app that helps to manage orders, listings, and customer queries efficiently.\n", "\neBay features two types of product listings: fixed-price items and auction items. Fixed price items can be purchased quickly by selecting the Buy It Now button. Auction items feature a Place Bid button for entering bids and show a current <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bidprice.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bid price</a>. These items are open to bids for a predetermined time and are declared \"sold\" to the highest bidder.\n", "\nC2C websites and similar platforms make money from fees charged to sellers for listing items for sale, adding on promotional features, and facilitating credit card transactions. These C2C transactions\u00a0typically\u00a0involve used products sold through a classified or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/auction.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">auction</a> system.\n", "\nThe C2C market is projected to grow in the future because of its cost-effectiveness. The cost of using <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/third-party.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">third parties</a> is declining, and the number of products for sale by consumers is steadily rising. Retailers consider it to be an\u00a0essential business model because of\u00a0the popularity of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/social-media.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">social media</a> and other online channels. These channels showcase specific products already owned by consumers and increase demand, which drives increased online traffic to C2C platforms.\n", "\nHowever, C2C has problems such as a lack of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quality-control.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">quality control</a> or payment guarantees. In some cases,\u00a0there is little support for credit card transactions, although the emergence of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/paypal.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PayPal</a> and other such payment systems over the years has helped simplify payments on C2C platforms.\n", "\nThe C2C marketplace has increased over time, as more companies have entered the space to facilitate C2C transactions. Many companies <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financialcareers/07/idea-clients.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">target niche markets</a> and\u00a0list specific products to\u00a0attract unique consumers.\n", "\nFor example, Amit Lakhotia, former vice president of payments at Paytm, left\u00a0his position in January 2016 to pursue other ventures, one of which was Tokopedia, one of Indonesia's largest online marketplaces. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www.tokopedia.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Tokopedia</a> is a C2C retailer that provides a platform on which\u00a0entrepreneurs can open\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smallandmidsizeenterprises.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">small and midsize C2C enterprises</a> (SME) for free. Between the second quarter of 2018 and the second quarter of 2019, Tokopedia was Indonesia's top e-commerce website, bringing in 140.4 million web visits.\u00a0\n", "\nThe C2C marketplace is increasing in popularity among sellers looking to maximize their sales potential by connecting with customers that they otherwise would not reach using traditional selling methods. Online platforms such as Etsy and Craigslist appeal to customers who can locate mostly any product or service at a price they are willing to pay.\n"]}
