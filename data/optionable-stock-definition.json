Not all companies that trade publicly on stock markets have exchange traded options. This is due in part to certain minimum requirements that need to be met, such as a minimum share price and minimum amount of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outstandingshares.asp\">outstanding shares</a>.\n", "\nCurrently, there are more than 5,000 companies with optionable stocks, as well as several hundred more <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp\">exchange traded funds</a> (ETF) with listed options. A stock being optionable allows investors to purchase options on the underlying stock, giving them the right to buy or sell shares of that underlying stock at a set price.\n", "\nIf a stock is not optionable, it is more difficult to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedge.asp\">hedge</a> positions in that stock, which makes it harder to mitigate the risks involved. For stocks like these, an investor can arrange for an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otc.asp\">over-the-counter</a> (OTC) options contract to be written with their <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/broker-dealer.asp\">broker-dealer</a>. It is quite easy these days to look up online if a stock has listed options on it or not. The easiest way to check whether a stock is optionable is to go to the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cboe.asp\">Chicago Board Options Exchange</a> (CBOE) website and check whether there are options listed for a particular stock.\n", "\nIn order to have options listed for a stock, it must meet certain criteria. Under current CBOE rules, there are five primary criteria that a company must meet before options on its stock can be traded on the options exchange:\n", "\nIf a company does not meet any one of these criteria, options exchanges, like the CBOE, will not allow any options to be traded on the underlying security. Additionally, because of the second condition listed above, a company cannot have options traded on it until at least three months after its <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ipo.asp\">initial public offering</a> (IPO) date.\n"]}
