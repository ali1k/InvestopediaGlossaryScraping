Quota share reinsurance allows an insurer to retain some risk and premium while sharing the rest with an insurer up to a predetermined maximum coverage. Overall, it's a way for an insurer to boost and preserve some of its capital.\n", "\nWhen an insurance company underwrites a new policy, the policyholder pays it a premium. In exchange, it agrees to indemnify the policyholder up to the coverage limit. The more policies that an\u00a0insurer underwrites, the more its <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liability.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">liabilities</a>\u00a0will grow, and at some point, it will run\u00a0out of capacity to underwrite any new policies.\n", "\nIn order to free up capacity, the insurer can cede some of its liabilities to a reinsurer through a reinsurance treaty. In exchange for taking on an insurer's liabilities, the reinsurer receives a portion of the policy premiums.\n", "\nA quota share treaty is a reinsurance agreement in which the insurer cedes a portion of its risks and premiums up to a maximum dollar limit. Losses above this limit are the insurer's responsibility, though the insurer can use an excess of loss reinsurance agreement to cover losses that exceed the maximum per policy coverage.\n", "\nSome quota share treaties also include per-occurrence limits that restrict the amount of losses a\u00a0reinsurer is willing to share on a per-occurrence basis. Insurers are less willing to accept this type of agreement because it can lead to a situation in which the insurer is responsible for most of the losses from a particular occurrence of a peril, such as a catastrophic flood.\n", "\nThink of a quota share treaty as giving away a part of an\u00a0insurer's retention. In return, the insurer gets to increase its acceptance capacity with automatic cover.\n", "\nA quota share treaty\u00a0reduces financial exposure to adverse claim fluctuations. The <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cedent.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cedent</a> can continue to participate in the underwriting gains in some negotiated percentage, even though it has reinsured the business, and has access to outside expertise from a professional reinsurer.\u00a0\n", "\nConsider an insurance company looking to reduce its exposure to the liabilities created through its underwriting activities. It enters into a quota share reinsurance contract. The contract has the insurance company\u00a0retaining 40% of its premiums, losses, and coverage limits, but cedes the remaining 60%\u00a0to a reinsurer. This\u00a0treaty would be called a 60% quota share treaty because the reinsurer is taking on that percentage of the insurer's liabilities.\n"]}
