In effect, it shows the amount of money a firm has left over after deducting the\u00a0explicit costs\u00a0of running the business.\n", "\nThe costs that need to be considered include the following:\n", "\nLike accounting profit, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/economic-profit/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">economic profit</a><strong> </strong>deducts explicit costs from revenue.

Accounting profit has many uses, including for tax declarations. Economic profit, on the other hand, is mainly just calculated to help management make a decision.\n", "\nCompanies often choose to supplement accounting profit with their own subjective take on their profit position. One such example is underlying profit. This popular, widely-used metric often excludes <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/one-time-charge.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">one-time charges</a>\u00a0or infrequent occurrences and is regularly flagged by management as a key number for investors to pay attention to.\n", "\nThe goal of underlying profit is to eliminate the impact that random events, such as a natural disaster, have on earnings. Losses or gains that do not regularly crop up, such as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/restructuring-charge.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">restructuring charges</a> or the buying or selling of land or property, are usually not taken into account because they do not occur often and, as a result, are not deemed to reflect the everyday costs of running the business.\n", "\nCompany A operates in the manufacturing industry and sells widgets for $5.

This is the first number entered into its income statement.\n", "\nThe\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cogs.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cost of goods sold</a> (COGS) is then subtracted from revenue to arrive at gross revenue. If it costs $1 to produce a widget, the company's COGS would be $2,000, and its gross revenue would be $8,000, or ($10,000 - $2,000).\n", "\nAfter calculating the company's gross revenue, all operating costs are subtracted to arrive at the company's operating profit, or earnings before interest, taxes, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/depreciation.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">depreciation</a>, and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/amortization.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">amortization</a> (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebitda.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">EBITDA</a>).
