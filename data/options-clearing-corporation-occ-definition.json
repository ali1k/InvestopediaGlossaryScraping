The largest equity derivatives clearing organization in the world, it operates under the jurisdiction of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC).\n", "\nThe OCC should not be confused with the U.S. Treasury's Office of the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/office-comptroller-currency-occ.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Comptroller of the Currency,</a> which also goes by the acronym 'OCC'.\n", "\nThe objective of the OCC, which was founded in 1973, is to instill stability in\u00a0the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equity_derivative.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">equity derivatives</a> market. According to its mission statement, the OCC is a customer-driven <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/clearingcorporation.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">clearing organization</a> that delivers risk management, clearance, and settlement services.\n", "\nUnder its SEC jurisdiction, the OCC <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/clearing.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">clears</a> transactions for put and call options, stock indexes, foreign currencies, interest rate composites, and single-stock futures. Meanwhile, as a registered derivatives clearing organization (DCO) under CFTC jurisdiction, it provides clearing and settlement services for transactions in futures products, as well as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/options-on-futures.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">options on futures</a>.\n", "\nThe organization essentially acts as a guarantor to ensure the obligations of the contracts it clears are fulfilled.

Changes were made so it could adapt its operations to better address risk. Federal regulators began to see the OCC as an increasingly integral part of the governance and oversight of the markets. The heightened attention focused on the organization brought with it some unfavorable assessments by regulators.\n", "\nIn 2013, the SEC criticized the OCC\u2019s management and planning for the way it handled market-wide issues.
