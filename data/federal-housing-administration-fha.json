Mortgage insurance protects lenders against losses from mortgage defaults. If a borrower defaults on a loan, the FHA pays the lender a specified claim amount.\n", "\nThe primary goal of establishing the FHA was to stimulate\u00a0the housing industry. The underlying idea was that, in providing insurance to lenders, more individuals would ultimately qualify for mortgages to buy homes. Most FHA loans are for individuals who could not afford, and would not ordinarily qualify for, a traditional home mortgage loan.\n", "\nThe <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortgage-insurance.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mortgage insurance</a>\u00a0premium (MIP) is the money a homeowner pays to the FHA as a part of the FHA mortgage program.\u00a0As of 2020, for all loan terms and a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/loantovalue.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">loan to value (LTV)</a> ratio larger than 90%, the annual MIP will be collected until the end of the loan term, or 11 years, whichever occurs first. Loan to value (LTV) ratios less than, or equal to, 90%, will have\u00a0annual MIP due until the end of the loan term, or 11 years, whichever occurs first.\u00a0For borrowers with a 15-year fixed term, they must pay 3.5% interest. For borrowers with a 30-year fixed term, they must pay 3.375% interest.\n", "\nDuring the Great Depression, bank failure caused\u00a0the number of home loans and homeownership to decrease significantly. During this period, home mortgages were generally for short periods (e.g., three to five years), with balloon instruments at LTV ratios of less than 60% and with no <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/amortization.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">amortization</a>.\u00a0\n", "\nThis significant banking crisis forced lenders to seek out borrowers of unpaid mortgages immediately. Because refinancing was impossible, most borrowers failed to make mortgage payments, and their homes were foreclosed upon, which further adversely affected the housing industry.\n", "\nBecause the federal banking system needed restructuring, Congress enacted the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/national-housing-act.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">National Housing Act</a> of 1934. Its primary purpose was to improve housing standards and conditions, provide a method of mutual mortgage insurance, and reduce foreclosures on family home mortgages. The legislation created two agencies, the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federal-savings-and-loan-insurance-corporation-fslic.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC)</a> and the FHA.\u00a0\n", "\nThese acts caused an increase in the single-family home market and built more affordable housing and mortgages. The FHA officially became part of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in 1965.\n", "\nThe FHA operates from self-generated income resulting in no burden on taxpayers. The FHA holds proceeds from mortgage insurance in an account used to pay for the program. FHA programs provide substantial economic stimulation to the United States via community and home development which flows down to local communities in the form of jobs, schools, and other sources of revenue.\n"]}
