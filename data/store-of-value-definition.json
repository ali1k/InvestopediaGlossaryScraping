A nation's money must be a credible store of value in order for its citizens to engage in labor and trade, save money, and spend it.

In fact, the United States was on a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/09/gold-standard.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">gold standard</a>, meaning that dollars were redeemable for a specific weight of gold, up until 1971.\n", "\nPresident Richard Nixon ended dollar convertibility to give the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalreservebank.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Federal Reserve</a> (Fed) greater power to influence the rates of employment and inflation, among other factors.

The price of gold, in particular, will often skyrocket during times of national peril or when a financial shock hits the broad markets, earning it a reputation as the ultimate <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/safe-haven.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">safe haven</a>.\n", "\nWhile the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/relative-value.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">relative value</a> of such stores of value will fluctuate over time, they can be counted on to retain some value in almost any scenario.
