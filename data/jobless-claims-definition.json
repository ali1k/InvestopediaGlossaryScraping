There are two categories of jobless claims\u2014initial, which comprises people filing for the first time, and continuing, which consists of unemployed people who have already been receiving unemployment benefits. Jobless claims are an important <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leadingindicator.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">leading indicator</a> on the state of the employment situation and the health of the economy.\n", "\nDuring the economic downturn caused by the spread of the COVID-19 virus, weekly jobless claims in the U.S. soared to historical levels as companies reduced their payrolls as business was halted due to social distancing. More than 28 million Americans filed for unemployment from mid-March to April 30, according to the Labor Dept.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nThe nation's jobless claims is an extremely important indicator for a macroeconomic analysis. The\u00a0monthly <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bls.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>'\u00a0Employment Report\u00a0tracks how many new people have filed for\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unemployment-compensation.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">unemployment benefits</a>\u00a0in the previous week. It is a good gauge of the U.S. job market. For instance, when more people file for unemployment benefits, it generally means fewer people have jobs, and vice versa. Investors can use this report to form an opinion on economic performance, but it's a very volatile data on a weekly basis. Often, the moving four-week average of jobless claims is monitored rather than the weekly figure.\u00a0The report is released at 8:30 a.m. ET\u00a0on Thursdays and can be a market moving event.\n", "\nAs mentioned, the initial jobless claims measure emerging unemployment and the continued claims data measure the number of people still claiming unemployment benefits. The continued claims data is released one week later than the initial claims. For this reason, the initial claims usually have a higher impact on the financial markets.\n", "\nMany financial analysts incorporate estimates of the report into their market forecast. If a weekly release on jobless claims comes insignificantly different than consensus estimates, this can move the markets higher or lower. Generally the move is the inverse of the report. If initial jobless claims are down, the market will often rally upwards. If the initial jobless claims are up, the market may slump.\n", "\nThe Initial Jobless Claims Report gets a lot of press due to its simplicity and the basic assumption that the healthier the job market, the healthier the economy. That is, more people working means more\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/disposableincome.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">disposable income</a> in the economy, which leads to higher personal consumption and\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gdp.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">gross domestic product</a>\u00a0(GDP).\n", "\nSometimes\u00a0markets will\u00a0react strongly to a mid-month jobless claims report, particularly if it shows a difference from the cumulative evidence of other recent indicators. For instance, if other indicators are showing a weakening economy, a surprise drop in jobless claims could slow down equity sellers and could actually lift stocks. Sometimes this happens simply because there isn't any other recent data to chew on at the time.\u00a0A favorable initial jobless claims\u00a0report may also get lost in the shuffle of a busy news day\u00a0and hardly be noticed by Wall Street.\n", "\nJobless claims are also used as an input for the creation of models and indicators. For example, average weekly initial jobless claims are one of the 10 components of the\u00a0Conference Board's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cili.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Composite Index of Leading Indicators</a>.\n"]}
