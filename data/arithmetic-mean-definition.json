It simply involves taking the sum of a group of numbers, then dividing that sum by the count of the numbers used in the series. For example, take\u00a0the numbers 34, 44, 56, and 78. The sum is 212. The arithmetic mean is 212 divided by four, or 53.\n", "\nPeople also use several other types of means, such as the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/geometricmean.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">geometric mean</a> and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/harmonicaverage.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">harmonic mean</a>, which comes into play in certain situations in finance and investing. Another example is the trimmed mean, used when calculating economic data such as the consumer price index (CPI) and personal consumption expenditures\u00a0(PCE).\n", "\nThe arithmetic mean maintains its place in finance, as well. For example, mean earnings estimates typically are an arithmetic mean. Say you want to know the average <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earnings.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">earnings</a> expectation of the 16 <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/analyst.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">analysts</a> covering a particular stock. Simply add up all the estimates and divide by 16 to get the arithmetic mean.\n", "\nThe same is true if you want to calculate a stock\u2019s average closing price during a particular month. Say there are 23 trading days in the month. Simply take all the prices, add them up, and divide by 23 to get the arithmetic mean.\n", "\nThe arithmetic mean is simple, and most people with even a little bit of finance and math skill can calculate it. It\u2019s also a useful measure of central tendency, as it tends to provide useful results, even with large groupings of numbers.\n", "\nThe arithmetic mean isn't always ideal, especially when a single outlier can skew the mean by a large amount. Let\u2019s say you want to estimate the allowance of a group of 10 kids. Nine of them get an allowance between $10 and $12 a week. The tenth kid gets an allowance of $60. That one outlier is going to result in an arithmetic mean of $16. This is not very representative of the group.\n", "\nIn this particular case, the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/median.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">median</a> allowance of 10 might be a better measure.\n", "\nThe arithmetic mean also isn\u2019t great when calculating the performance of investment portfolios, especially when it involves <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/compounding.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">compounding</a>, or the reinvestment of dividends and earnings. It is also generally not used to calculate present and future <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashflow.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cash flows</a>, which analysts use in making their estimates. Doing so is almost sure to lead to misleading numbers.\n", "\nFor these applications, analysts tend to use the geometric mean, which is calculated differently. The geometric mean is most appropriate for series that exhibit\u00a0serial correlation. This is especially true for investment <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/portfolio.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">portfolios</a>.\n", "\nMost returns in finance are correlated, including yields on bonds, stock returns, and\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketriskpremium.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">market risk premiums</a>. The longer the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/timehorizon.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">time horizon</a>, the more critical\u00a0compounding and the use of the geometric mean becomes. For volatile numbers, the geometric average provides a far\u00a0more accurate measurement of the true return by taking into account year-over-year compounding.\n", "\nThe geometric mean takes the product of all numbers in the series and raises\u00a0it to the inverse of the length of the series. It\u2019s more laborious by hand, but easy to calculate in Microsoft Excel using the GEOMEAN function.\n", "\nThe geometric mean differs from the\u00a0arithmetic average, or arithmetic mean,\u00a0in how it's calculated because it takes into account the compounding that occurs from period to period. Because of this, investors usually consider the geometric mean a more accurate measure of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/return.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">returns</a> than the arithmetic mean.\n", "\nLet's say that a stock's returns over the last five years are 20%, 6%, -10%, -1%, and 6%. The arithmetic mean would simply add those up and divide by five, giving a 4.2% per year average return.\n", "\nThe geometric mean would instead be calculated as (1.2 x 1.06 x 0.9 x 0.99 x 1.06)<sup>1/5</sup> -1 = 3.74% per year average return. Note that the geometric mean, a more accurate calculation in this case, will always be smaller than the arithmetic mean.\n"]}
