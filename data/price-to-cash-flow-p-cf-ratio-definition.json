The utility, on the other hand, has stable cash flows but few growth prospects\u00a0and, as a result, trades at a lower valuation.\n", "\nThere is no single figure that points to an optimal P/CF ratio. However, generally speaking, a ratio in the low single digits may indicate the stock is undervalued, while a higher ratio may suggest potential overvaluation.\n", "\nThe <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pricetofreecashflow.asp\">price-to-free-cash flow</a> ratio is a more rigorous measure than the P/CF ratio.\n", "\nThough very similar to P/CF, this metric is considered a more exact measure because it uses <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/freecashflow.asp\">free cash flow</a> (FCF), which subtracts capital expenditures (CapEx) from a company's total OCF, thereby reflecting the actual cash flow available to fund non-asset-related growth.
