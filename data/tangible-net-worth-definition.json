Intellectual property includes things such as proprietary technology or designs.\n", "\nTangible net worth is a factor often considered by a lender from whom a company or individual is seeking financing. Typically, banks and creditors will use physical assets of a company to secure a borrowing facility. If the company fails to make payments or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/default2.asp\">defaults</a>, the bank can legally seize the assets. The tangible net worth calculation helps creditors determine the size and terms of the borrowing facility so that they don't lend more than the company's assets are worth.\n", "\nA drawback of using tangible net worth is that it may fall substantially short as a representation of actual net worth in cases where a company or an individual has intangible assets of considerable value. For example, a major computer software firm such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=msft\">MSFT</a>) may possess a wealth of intellectual property rights and other intangible assets that are worth billions of dollars, which would be excluded from the tangible net worth calculation.\n", "\nOne item that can complicate the tangible net worth calculation is <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/subordinateddebt.asp\">subordinated debt</a>, debt that in the event of a default or liquidation is only repaid after all debt obligations to senior debt holders have been satisfied. A simple example of subordinated debt is a secondary mortgage held on real estate.\n", "\nThe secondary mortgage is only repaid after the debt represented by the primary mortgage is paid off. If the value of the property on which a company or individual holds subordinated debt is not sufficient to retire that debt in addition to the debt owed to senior and primary debt holders, then the subordinated debt should not be included in the calculation of tangible net worth.\n"]}
