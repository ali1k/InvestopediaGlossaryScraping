It allows the account holder to see all the transactions processed on their account. Banks usually send monthly statements to an account holder on a set date. In addition, transactions on a statement typically appear in chronological order.\n", "\nMany banks offer account holders the option of receiving paper statements or using paperless, electronic ones, usually delivered via email. An electronic version of a bank statement is known as an electronic statement or e-statement and allows account holders to access their statements online where they can download or print them. Some banks email statements to customers as an attachment.

They can help account holders track their finances, identify errors, and recognize spending habits. An account holder should verify their bank account on a regular basis\u2014either daily, weekly, or monthly\u2014to ensure their records match the bank\u2019s records. This helps reduce overdraft fees, errors, and fraud.\n", "\nIf any discrepancies are found, they must be reported to the bank in a timely manner.
