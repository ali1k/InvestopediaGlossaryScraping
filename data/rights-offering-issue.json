Rights are often transferable, allowing the holder to sell them in the open market.\n", "\nIn a rights offering, each shareholder receives the right to purchase a pro-rata allocation of additional shares at a specific price and within a specific period (usually 16 to 30 days). <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholder.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Shareholders</a>, notably, are not obligated to exercise this right.\u00a0\n", "\nA rights offering is effectively an invitation to existing shareholders to purchase additional new\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shares.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">shares</a>\u00a0in the company.

Examples include when there is a need to pay off debt, purchase equipment, or acquire another company. In some cases, a company may use a rights offering to raise money when there are no other viable financing alternatives.\u00a0Other significant benefits of a rights offering are that the issuing company can bypass <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underwriting-fees.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">underwriting fees</a>, there is no shareholder approval needed, and market interest in the issuer's common stock generally peaks.
