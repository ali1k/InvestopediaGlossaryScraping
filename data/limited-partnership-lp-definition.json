The <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/generalpartner.asp\">general partner</a> oversees and runs the business while limited partners do not partake in managing the business. However, the general partner of a limited partnership has unlimited liability for the debt, and any limited partners have limited liability up to the amount of their investment.\u00a0\n", "\nA limited partnership is required to have both general partners and limited partners. General partners have unlimited liability and have full management control of the business. Limited partners have little to no involvement in management, but also have liability that's limited to their investment amount in the LP.\n", "\nGenerally, a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/partnership.asp\">partnership</a> is a business where two or more individuals have ownership. There are three forms of partnerships: limited partnership, general partnership, and limited liability partnership. The three forms differ in various aspects, but also share similar features.\n", "\nIn all forms of partnerships, each partner must contribute resources such as property, money, skills, or labor to share in the business' profits and losses. At least one partner takes part in making decisions regarding the business' day-to-day affairs.\n", "\nAll partnerships should have an agreement that specifies how to make business decisions. These decisions include how to split profits or losses, resolve conflicts, and alter ownership structure, and how to close the business, if necessary.\n", "\nA limited partnership is usually a type of investment partnership, often used as investment vehicles for investing in such assets as real estate. LPs differ from other partnerships in that partners can have limited liability, meaning they are not liable for business debts that exceed their initial investment.\n", "\nGeneral partners are responsible for the daily management of the limited partnership and are liable for the company's financial obligations, including debts and litigation. Other contributors, known as limited (or silent) partners, provide capital but cannot make managerial decisions and are not responsible for any debts beyond their initial investment.\u00a0\n", "\nA <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/generalpartnership.asp\">general partnership</a> is a partnership when all partners share in the profits, managerial responsibilities, and liability for debts equally. If the partners plan to share profits or losses unequally, they should document this in a legal partnership agreement to avoid future disputes.\n", "\nA <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jointventure.asp\">joint venture</a> is often a type of general partnership that remains valid until the completion of a project or a certain period passes. All partners have an equal right to control the business and share in any profits or losses. They also have a fiduciary responsibility to act in the best interests of other members as well as the venture.\n", "\nA limited liability partnership (LLP) is a type of partnership where all partners have limited liability. All partners can also partake in management activities. This is unlike a limited partnership, where at least one general partner must have unlimited liability and limited partners cannot be part of management.\u00a0\n", "\nLLPs are often used for structuring professional services companies, such as law and accounting firms. However, LLP partners are not responsible for the misconduct or negligence of other partners.\u00a0\n", "\nAlmost all U.S. states govern the formation of limited partnerships under the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www.leg.state.nv.us/NRS/NRS-087A.html\">Uniform Limited Partnership Act</a>, which was originally introduced in 1916 and has since been amended multiple times. The most recent revision was in 2013.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\"></span> The majority of the United States\u201449 states and the District of Columbia\u2014have adopted these provisions with Louisiana as the sole exception.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\"></span>\n", "\nTo form a limited partnership, partners must register the venture in the applicable state, typically through the office of the local Secretary of State. It is important to obtain all relevant business permits and licenses, which vary based on locality, state, or industry. The U.S. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/small-business-administration.asp\">Small Business Administration</a> (SBA) lists all local, state, and federal permits and licenses necessary to start a business.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\"></span>\n", "\nNote that in music, LP means long-playing, which is another word for an album. An LP is longer than a single or extended play (EP) album. It was originally used to describe longer length vinyl albums. However, it\u2019s now also used to describe CDs and digital music albums.\n", "\nThe key advantage to an LP, at least for limited partners, is that their personal liability is limited. They are only responsible for the amount invested in the LP. These entities can be used by GPs when looking to raise capital for investment. Many hedge funds and real estate investment partnerships are set up as LPs.\u00a0\n", "\nLimited partners also don't have to pay self-employment taxes. LPs are pass-through entities, meaning the entity files a Form 1065, and then partners receive <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/09/k-1-tax-form.asp\">Schedule K-1s</a> that they use to include their portion of the income or loss on their own personal tax returns.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\"></span>\n", "\nOn the downside, LPs require that the general partner have unlimited liability. They are responsible for 100% of management control but also are on the hook for any debts or mishandling of business dealings. As well, limited partners are only allowed limited involvement in operations. If their role is deemed non-passive, they lose personal liability protection.\u00a0\n", "\nBusinesses that form a limited partnership generally do so to own or operate a set of specific assets, such as a real estate investment partnership or LP for managing oil pipelines. One party (the general partner) has control over the assets and management responsibilities, but also are personally liable. The other party (limited partners) are generally investors whose personal liability is limited to their investment.\n", "\nBoth LLCs and LPs offer flexibility in structuring responsibilities, profit-split, and taxes. An LP allows certain investors (limited partners) to invest without having a management role or any personal liability, while the general partners carry all the liability. With an LLC, the owners can shield themselves from personal liability, but all generally have management roles. An LP must have at least one limited partner.\n", "\nLLCs also have greater flexibility for tax reporting. Often, the general partner of an LP will be structured as an LLC to help provide personal liability protection, as LLC managers are typically not held personally responsible for the businesses\u2019 liabilities.\u00a0\n", "\nAn LP and LLP have a similar structure. However, LPs have general partners and limited partners, while LLPs have no general partners. All partners in an LLP have limited liability.\n", "\nLimited partnerships are taxed as pass-through entities, meaning each partner receives a Schedule K-1 which they include on their personal tax return.\n", "\nLimited partnerships are ideal entities for raising capital for a particular investment or set of assets. They allow limited partners to invest while keeping their liability limited.\n", "\nLimited partnerships are generally used by hedge funds and investment partnerships as they offer the ability to raise capital without giving up control. Limited partners invest in an LP and have little to no control over the management of the entity, but their liability is limited to their personal investment. Meanwhile, general partners manage and run the LP, but their liability is unlimited.\n"]}
