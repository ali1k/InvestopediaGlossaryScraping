He\u00a0is well-known for his numerous contributions to the field of economics and political philosophy. Hayek's approach mostly stems from the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/austrian_school.asp\">Austrian school</a> of economics and emphasizes the limited nature of knowledge. He is particularly famous for his defense of free-market capitalism and is remembered as one of the greatest critics of the socialist consensus.\n", "\nAccording to the official Nobel Prize website, Friedrich Hayek and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gunnar-myrdal.asp\">Gunnar Myrdal</a>\u00a0each won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1974 \"for their pioneering work in the theory of money and economic fluctuations and their penetrating analysis of the interdependence of economic, social and institutional phenomena.\" After his death, some of the universities Hayek had taught at made tributes to him (such as naming an auditorium after him).\n", "\nHayek is considered a\u00a0major social theorist and political philosopher of the 20th\u00a0century. His theory on\u00a0how\u00a0changing prices relay\u00a0information\u00a0that helps people\u00a0determine their plans is widely regarded as an important milestone achievement\u00a0in economics. This theory is what led him to the Nobel Prize.\n", "\nA World War I veteran, Hayek later said\u00a0his experience in the war and his desire to help avoid the mistakes that ignited the war drew him into economics. Hayek lived in Austria, Great Britain, the United States, and Germany and became a British subject in 1938. He spent most of his academic life at the\u00a0London School of Economics\u00a0(LSE), the\u00a0University of Chicago, and the\u00a0University of Freiburg.\n", "\nOne of Hayek's key achievements was his book\u00a0<a data-component=\"amazon\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"affiliate\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Road-Serfdom-Documents-Definitive-Collected/dp/0226320553\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>The Road to Serfdom</em></a>, which he wrote out of concern for\u00a0the general view in British\u00a0academia that fascism was a capitalist reaction to socialism. It was written between 1940 and 1943. The title was inspired by the French classical liberal thinker\u00a0Alexis de Tocqueville's writings on the \"road to servitude.\"\u00a0\n", "\nThe book\u00a0was quite popular and\u00a0was published in the United States by the University of Chicago in September of that year, which propelled it to even\u00a0greater popularity than in Britain.\u00a0At the instigation of editor\u00a0Max Eastman, the American magazine\u00a0<em>Reader's Digest</em>\u00a0also published an abridged version in April 1945, enabling\u00a0<em>The Road to Serfdom</em>\u00a0to reach a far wider audience than academics. The book is widely popular among those advocating\u00a0individualism\u00a0and\u00a0classical liberalism.\n", "\nIn 1984, Hayek\u00a0was appointed a member of the\u00a0Order of the Companions of Honour\u00a0by\u00a0Queen Elizabeth II,\u00a0on the advice of Prime Minister\u00a0Margaret Thatcher,\u00a0for his \"services to the study of economics.\"\u00a0He was the first recipient of the\u00a0Hanns Martin Schleyer Prize\u00a0in 1984.\u00a0He also received the U.S.\u00a0Presidential Medal of Freedom\u00a0in 1991 from President\u00a0George H. W. Bush.\n"]}
