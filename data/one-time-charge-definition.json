A one-time charge can either be a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashcharge.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cash charge</a> against\u00a0earnings such as the cost of paying\u00a0severance expenses to laid-off former employees or a non-cash charge such as the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/writedown.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">writing down</a> of the value of assets such as a piece of real estate whose market value has fallen due to changes in business fundamentals or consumer preferences.\n", "\nFinancial <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/analyst.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">analysts</a> routinely exclude one-time charges when they evaluate a company's ongoing earnings potential.\n", "\nSome one-time charges do indeed only take place once. In such a case, they should not recur and would not impact the long-run performance and growth of a company. As a result, they may be excluded from <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proforma.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pro-forma</a> financial statements or labeled as an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/extraordinaryitem.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">extraordinary item</a>.\n", "\nHowever, some companies incorrectly record charges that they repeatedly incur in the course of their usual business activities as one-time charges. This practice may make the company\u2019s financial health look better than it really is, and it is a practice that investors should be aware of.\n", "\nMany consider this practice to be a dangerous trend. Some companies even use restructuring charges as a device to improve future earnings and profitability. By taking large restructuring charges, firms reduce depreciation in future periods and thus increase earnings. This is accentuated when profitability is measured on a return basis since the book value of capital and equity is also reduced by large restructuring charges.\n", "\nThus, many analysts regard one-time charges with skepticism, and the adjustments should reflect what they see. If the one-time charges are really operating expenses, they should be treated as such and earnings estimated after these charges. If one-time charges are actually one-time charges, earnings should be estimated prior to these charges.\n", "\nWhen it comes to computing return on equity and capital, however, a more reliable estimate may be obtained if the book value of equity and capital are estimated prior to extraordinary charges, not just in the current period but cumulatively, over time.\n", "\nFor example, Acme Technology Company may properly <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/write-off.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">write off</a> costs related to restructuring its file server business as a one-time charge. However if the company also writes down <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inventory.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">inventory</a> costs every other quarter and reports these charges as one-time charges, it is less than clear that these inventory write-down charges are truly one-time charges and Acme\u2019s financial circumstances may be somewhat different than investors and analysts are being led to believe by the company.\n", "\nWhile financial analysts may disregard one-time charges when making their judgments on a company's earnings, stock prices are not so forgiving. In fact, stock returns have demonstrated a tendency to significantly suffer during periods of frequent one-time charges.\n", "\nThus, it's important for anyone researching a given stock, which has been subjected to one-time charges, to understand the nature of each one-time charge. They are not all equal in the eyes of the investor or analyst. Some charges represent good economic decisions made by the company. Others may reflect that the company's finances catching up with past negative events.\n"]}
