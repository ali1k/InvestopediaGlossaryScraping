Aptitude tests assume that individuals have inherent strengths and weaknesses, and have a natural inclination toward success or failure in specific areas based on their innate characteristics.\n", "\nNote that an aptitude test does not test knowledge or intelligence; only a particular skill or propensity. Therefore, it is not a test for which a person can study.\n", "\nAn aptitude test\u00a0may be taken by individuals to determine the kinds of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-careers/08/financial-career-options-professionals.asp\">careers</a> that are a good match for their skills and interests. Similarly, high school students may take an aptitude test when thinking about what would be an appropriate college major or whether college is the best choice for them.\n", "\nSome schools administer aptitude tests to students beginning in elementary school. Along with intelligence tests and achievement tests that measure student mastery of academic content, aptitude tests may be used to determine placement in gifted and talented programs or other specific educational tracks.\n", "\nFor example, the Modern Language Aptitude Test (MLAT) measures a student's potential for successfully mastering foreign languages. Aptitude tests can also help determine if a student needs special education services.\n", "\nFor older students, Differential Aptitude Tests (DATs) assess a range of aptitudes from spatial relations to language usage. The results can help administrators make curricular recommendations.\n", "\nCounselors might use high scores in a test in mechanical reasoning, for example, to guide a student toward courses that prepare them for engineering or designing studies in college. Students who score well in tests measuring speed, accuracy, and problem-solving might decide to choose coursework in computer science, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/finance.asp\">finance</a>, or other fields requiring attention to detail.\n", "\nSome companies use aptitude tests to help them make hiring decisions. These tests, which are called career assessment tests, help\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/humanresources.asp\">human resources</a>\u00a0personnel learn more about a prospective employee's strengths and weaknesses. Career assessment tests may also be used within a company for making decisions about promotions.\n", "\nSituational judgment tests are a specific kind of career aptitude test that can help predict how an employee might respond to specific situations in the workplace. They are also used to assess an employee's communication style and ability to work within a team.\n", "\nSome situational judgment tests focus specifically on\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/customer-service.asp\">customer service</a>\u00a0careers. These tests analyze personality traits that are predictive of successful interaction with the public, such as empathy,\u00a0diplomacy, and patience. Situational judgment tests may also be used to predict future competency in sales-related careers.\n"]}
