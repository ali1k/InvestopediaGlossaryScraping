Because both share prices can change from the time the initial numbers are drafted to when the deal closes, the exchange ratio is usually structured as a fixed exchange ratio or a floating exchange ratio.\n", "\nA fixed exchange ratio is fixed until the deal closes. The number of issued shares is known but the value of the deal is unknown. The acquiring company prefers this method as the number of shares is known therefore the percentage of control is known.\n", "\nA floating exchange ratio is where the ratio floats so that the target company receives a fixed value no matter the changes in price shares. In a floating exchange ratio, the shares are unknown but the value of the deal is known. The target company, or seller, prefers this method as they know the exact value they will be receiving.\n", "\nImagine that the buyer of a company offers the seller two shares of the buyer's company in exchange for one share of the seller's company. Prior to the announcement of the deal, the buyer's or acquirer's shares may be trading at $10, while the seller's or target's shares trade at $15. Due to the 2 to 1 exchange ratio, the buyer is effectively offering $20 for a seller share that is trading at $15.\n", "\nFixed exchange ratios are usually limited by caps and floors to reflect extreme changes in stock prices. Caps and floors prevent the seller from receiving significantly less consideration than anticipated, and they likewise prevent the buyer from giving up significantly more consideration than anticipated.\n", "\nPost announcement of a deal, there is usually a gap in valuation between the seller's and buyer's shares to reflect the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/timevalueofmoney.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">time value of money</a> and risks. Some of these risks include the deal being blocked by the government, shareholder disapproval, or extreme changes in markets or economies.\n", "\nTaking advantage of the gap, believing that the deal will go through, is referred to as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mergerarbitrage.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">merger arbitrage</a> and is practiced by <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedgefund.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hedge funds</a> and other investors. Leveraging the example above, assume that the buyer's shares stay at $10 and the seller's shares jump to $18. There will be a $2 gap that investors can secure by buying one seller share for $18 and shorting two buyer shares for $20.\n", "\nIf the deal closes, investors will receive two buyer shares in exchange for one seller share, closing out the short position and leaving investors with $20 in cash. Minus the initial outlay of $18, investors will net $2.\n"]}
