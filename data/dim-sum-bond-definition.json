Dim sum bonds are attractive to foreign investors who desire exposure to renminbi-denominated assets, but are restricted by China's capital controls from investing in domestic Chinese debt.\n", "\nThe term is derived from <em>dim sum</em>, a popular style of cuisine in Hong Kong which involves serving a variety of small delicacies.\n", "\nInternational investors who are looking to participate in the Chinese renminbi-denominated (RMB) market may look to the dim sum bond market.

After issuing such bonds, multinational issuers may use their proceeds freely in Hong Kong without PRC regulatory approval. The proceeds may also be used to settle cross-border trades.\n", "\nSince PRC approval is not required, the dim sum bond market is appealing to investors seeking to diversify their holdings. In addition, investors who bet on RMB appreciation can also use the dim sum bond market. This bond market also allows China to regulate the amount of offshore yuan that flow back into the mainland.\n", "\nThe dim sum bond is frequently compared to panda bonds. Panda bonds instead are onshore renminbi-denominated debt issued in China by overseas companies. The panda bond market is used as a capital-raising platform for foreign firms targeting domestic investors and hence, domestic investors are the main purchasers of these bonds.
