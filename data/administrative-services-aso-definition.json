For example, an organization may hire an insurance company to evaluate and process claims under its employee health plan while maintaining the responsibility of paying the claims itself. An ASO arrangement contrasts with a company that purchases health insurance for its employees from an external provider.\n", "\nASO arrangements are common in Canadian health plans. Plan specifics vary depending on the agreement a company establishes with insurance companies and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/third-party-claims-administrator.asp\">third-party administrators (TPA)</a>. In ASO arrangements, the insurance company provides little to no insurance protection, which is in contrast to a fully insured plan sold to the employer.\n", "\nAs such, an ASO plan is a type of self-insured or self-funded plan. The employer takes full responsibility for claims made to the plan. For this reason, many employers using ASO plans also establish <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aggregate-stop-loss-insurance.asp\">aggregate stop-loss</a> policies in which the insurance company takes responsibility for paying claims that exceed a certain level; for example, $10,000 per insured person in exchange for a premium.\n", "\nASO insurance plans typically cover short-term <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/disability-insurance.asp\">disability</a>, health, and dental benefits. Occasionally, they cover long-term disability for larger employers. ASO services are gaining popularity as many employers, particularly larger ones, explore the potential financial advantages that this type of plan can provide. An ASO may allow an employer to take greater control of benefit costs to meet the organization's\u00a0needs. However, ASO arrangements may not be suitable for all companies, and they come with certain <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risk.asp\">risks</a>.\u00a0\n", "\nThe costs for fully insured plans depend on an insurer's evaluation of anticipated claims for a given year. For an ASO, however, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/092613/pay-attention-your-funds-expense-ratio.asp\">annual funding</a> levels are based on actual paid claims. If there are fewer claims than anticipated, then employers keep the surplus and reinvest the reserves.\u00a0Employers also may offer eligible benefits that are not covered by conventional health plans.\u00a0\n", "\nHowever, employers\u00a0would be responsible for any <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deficit.asp\">deficit</a> if claims exceed budgeted amounts.\u00a0Catastrophic claims or sudden and unexpected events are of particular concern. Employers often invest in a stop-loss insurance policy to provide an additional level of protection in the event of these cases.\n", "\nOverall, however, an ASO arrangement may not be suitable for <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lifeinsurance.asp\">life insurance</a> and extended\u00a0healthcare benefits.\u00a0Ultimately, an employer would need to weigh the risks and benefits of how different ASO arrangements might affect their organizations.\n"]}
