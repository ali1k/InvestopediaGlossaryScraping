Takaful-branded insurance is based on <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shariah.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sharia</a> or Islamic religious law, which explains how individuals are responsible to cooperate and protect one another.

Much like a conventional insurance company,\u00a0costs include sales and marketing, underwriting, and claims management.\n", "\nAny claims made by participants are paid out of the takaful fund and any remaining surpluses, after making provisions for the likely cost of future claims and other reserves, belong to the participants in the fund\u2014not the takaful\u00a0operator.
