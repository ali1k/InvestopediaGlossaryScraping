Cash dividends are paid directly in money, as opposed to being paid as a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockdividend.asp\">stock dividend</a> or other form of value.\n", "\nThe board of directors must declare the issuing of all dividends and decide if the dividend payment should remain the same or change. Long-term investors who want to maximize their gains can\u00a0reinvest\u00a0their dividends. Most brokers offer a choice to reinvest or accept\u00a0cash dividends.\n", "\nCash dividends are a common way for companies to return <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital.asp\">capital</a> to their shareholders in the form of periodic cash payments\u2014typically, quarterly\u2014but some stocks may pay these bonuses on a monthly, annual, or semiannual basis.\n", "\nWhile many firms pay regular dividends, there are special cash dividends that are distributed to shareholders after certain nonrecurring events\u00a0such as legal settlements or the borrowing of money for\u00a0large, one-time cash distributions. Each company establishes its dividend policy and periodically assesses if a dividend cut or an increase is warranted. Cash dividends are paid on a per-share basis.\n", "\nA company's board of directors announces a cash dividend on a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/declarationdate.asp\">declaration date,</a> which entails paying a certain amount of money per common share. After that notification, the record date is established, which is the date on which a firm determines its shareholders on record who are eligible to receive the payment.\n", "\nIn addition, stock exchanges or other appropriate securities organizations determine an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ex-dividend.asp\">ex-dividend</a> date, which is typically two business days before the record date. An investor who bought common shares before the ex-dividend date is entitled to the announced cash dividend.\n", "\nCompanies that pay dividends typically enjoy stable cash flows, and their businesses are commonly beyond the\u00a0growth stage. This business growth cycle partially explains why growth firms do not pay dividends; they need these funds to expand their operations, build factories and increase their personnel.\n", "\nCertain dividend-paying companies may go as far as establishing dividend payout targets, which are based on generated profits in a given year. For example, banks typically pay out a certain percentage of their profits in the form of cash dividends. If profits decline, dividend policy can be postponed to\u00a0better times.\n", "\nWhen a corporation declares a dividend, it debits its <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/retainedearnings.asp\">retained earnings</a> and credits a liability account called dividend payable. On the date of payment, the company reverses the dividend payable with a debit entry and credits its cash account for the respective cash outflow.\n", "\nCash dividends do not affect a company's income statement. However, they shrink a company's shareholders' equity and cash balance by the same amount. Firms must report any cash dividend as payments in\u00a0the financing activity section of their <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashflowstatement.asp\">cash flow statement</a>.\n", "\nThe easiest way to compare cash dividends across companies is to look at the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/ttm.asp\">trailing 12-month</a> dividend yields, which are computed as a company's dividends per share for the most recent 12-month period divided by its current stock price. This computation standardizes the measure of cash dividends concerning the price of a common share.\n", "\nNike is a mature firm that pays quarterly cash dividends. In February 2019, the famous sportswear brand announced a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/nike-inc-declares-022-quarterly-dividend-20190214-01164\">quarterly cash dividend</a> of 22 cents per share on outstanding Class A and Class B Common Stock payable April 1, 2019.\n", "\nThe company had enjoyed increased revenues in the second quarter of 10 to 14%. Net income had increased by 10% compared to the same quarter in 2018, and diluted earnings per share had increased by 13% for the same period in 2018.\n"]}
