In relation to a loan, amortization focuses on spreading out loan payments over time. When applied to an asset, amortization is similar to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/depreciation.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">depreciation</a>.\n", "\nThe term \"amortization\" refers to two situations. First, amortization is used in the process of paying off debt through regular <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/principal.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">principal</a> and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interest.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">interest</a> payments over time.

With <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortgage.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mortgage</a> and auto loan payments, a higher percentage of the flat monthly payment goes toward interest early in the loan. With each subsequent payment, a greater percentage of the payment goes toward the loan's principal.\n", "\nAmortization can be calculated using most modern financial calculators, spreadsheet software packages, such as Microsoft Excel, or online amortization charts. Amortization schedules begin with the outstanding loan balance. For monthly payments, the interest payment is calculated by multiplying the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">interest rate</a> by the outstanding loan balance and dividing by twelve. The amount of principal due in a given month is the total monthly payment (a flat amount) minus the interest payment for that month.\n", "\nThe next month, the outstanding loan balance is calculated as the previous month's outstanding balance minus the most recent principal payment. The interest payment is once again calculated off the new outstanding balance, and the pattern continues until all principal payments have been made and the loan balance is zero at the end of the loan term.\n", "\nThe formula to calculate the monthly principal due on an amortized loan is as follows:\n", "\n<em>Principal Payment = Total Monthly Payment \u2013\u00a0(Outstanding Loan Balance * (Interest Rate / 12 Months))</em>\n", "\nTypically, the total monthly payment is specified when you take out a loan. However, if you are attempting to estimate or compare monthly payments based on a given set of factors, such as loan amount and interest rate, you may need to calculate the monthly payment as well. If you need to calculate the total monthly payment for any reason, the formula is as follows:\n", "\n<em>Total Monthly Payment = Loan Amount [ i (1+i) ^ n / ((1+i) ^ n) - 1) ]</em>\n", "\n<em>where:</em>\n", "\nAmortization can also refer to the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/amortization-of-intangibles.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">amortization of intangibles</a>. In this case, amortization is the process of expensing the cost of an\u00a0intangible asset over the projected life of the asset. It measures the consumption of the value of an intangible asset, such as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/goodwill.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">goodwill</a>, a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/patent.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">patent</a>, or a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/copyright.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">copyright</a>.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/101314/what-are-differences-between-amortization-and-impairment.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amortization is calculated</a> in a similar manner to depreciation, which is used for tangible assets, and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/depletion.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">depletion</a>, which is used for natural resources.\n", "\nWhen businesses amortize expenses over time, they help tie the cost of using an asset to the revenues it generates in the same <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accountingperiod.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">accounting period</a>, in accordance with <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gaap.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">generally accepted accounting principles</a> (GAAP). For example, a company benefits from the use of a long-term asset over a number of years. Thus, it writes off the expense incrementally over the useful life of that asset.\n", "\nThe amortization of intangibles is also useful in tax planning. The <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irs.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Internal Revenue Service</a> (IRS) allows taxpayers to take a deduction for certain expenses: geological and geophysical expenses incurred in oil and natural gas exploration, atmospheric pollution control facilities, bond premiums, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/randd.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">research and development</a> (R&amp;D), lease acquisition, forestation and reforestation, and intangibles, such as goodwill, patents, copyrights, and trademarks.\n", "\nFor example, let's look at a four-year, $30,000 auto loan at 3% interest. The monthly payment is going to be $664.03 ($30,000 ((.0025 (1.0025 ^ 48) / (1.0025 ^ 48) - 1))).\n", "\nIn the first month, $75.00 ($30,000 outstanding loan balance * 3% interest rate / 12 months) of the $664.03 monthly payment goes to\u00a0interest while the remaining\u00a0$589.03 ($664.03 total monthly payment - $75.00 interest payment) goes toward principal.\n", "\nEach month, the total payment stays the same, while the portion going to principal increases and the portion going to interest decreases. In the final month, only $1.66 is paid in interest because the outstanding loan balance at that point is very minimal compared to the starting loan balance.\n", "\nThe term \u201camortization\u201d has two important meanings in finance. First, it can refer to the schedule of payments whereby a loan is paid off gradually over time, such as in the case of a mortgage or car loan. Second, it can refer to the practice of expensing the cost of an intangible asset over time.\n", "\nAmortization is important because it helps businesses and investors understand and forecast their costs over time. In the context of loan repayment, amortization schedules provide clarity into what portion of a loan payment consists of interest versus principal. This can be useful for purposes such as deducting interest payments for tax purposes. Amortizing intangible assets is also important because it can reduce a business\u2019s taxable income and therefore its tax liability, while giving investors a better understanding of the company\u2019s true earnings.\n", "\nAmortization and depreciation are similar concepts, in that both attempt to capture the cost of holding an asset over time. The main difference between them, however, is that amortization refers to intangible assets whereas depreciation refers to tangible assets. Examples of intangible assets include trademarks and patents; whereas tangible assets include equipment, buildings, vehicles, and other assets subject to physical wear and tear.\n"]}
