The area defined\u00a0by the MSA is typically marked by significant social and economic interaction. People living in outlying rural areas, for example, may commute considerable distances to work, shop, or attend social activities in the urban center.\n", "\nAs of March 6, 2020 [OMB BULLETIN NO. 20-1], there are 392 regions that meet the requirements to be designated as metropolitan statistical areas (MSA) in the U.S. and Puerto Rico (384 in the United States and eight in Puerto Rico).\n", "\nIn contrast to micropolitan statistical areas, which center on towns and smaller communities with populations between 10,000\u201350,000, MSAs must include a city with a population of at least 50,000. Some MSAs, such as Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington, contain multiple cities with populations exceeding 50,000. The most populous MSA in the country, New York-Newark-Jersey City, spans portions of three adjacent states, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.\n", "\nThe <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bls.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> (BLS) uses MSA data to analyze <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/labor-market.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">labor market</a> conditions within a geographical area. Within a metropolitan statistical area, workers can presumably change jobs without having to move to a new location, creating a relatively stable labor force.\n", "\nStatistical data about MSAs also helps government officials and businesses review information about <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/percapita.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">per capita</a> income, spending patterns, and unemployment rates.

It is the most populous area of Georgia. Companies seeking to relocate or establish new companies in the Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Roswell region can use statistical data about the area to project the viability of their intended business.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/realestate.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Real estate</a> investors also use MSA data to study housing trends and population movement. In addition, applicants for certain social services may need to prove income levels below a fixed percentage of the median <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/grossincome.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">gross income</a> in their metropolitan statistical area to qualify for help, including low-income housing and other forms of support.\n"]}
