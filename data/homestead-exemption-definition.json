The homestead tax exemption can also provide surviving spouses with ongoing property tax relief, which is done on a graduated scale so that homes with lower <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assessedvalue.asp\">assessed values</a> benefit the most.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"15\"></span><span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"14\"></span>\n", "\nThe homestead exemption is helpful since it is designed to provide both physical shelter and financial protection, which can block the forced sale of a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/principalresidence.asp#:~:text=What%20Is%20a%20Principal%20Residence,lives%20most%20of%20the%20time.\">primary residence</a>.

The homestead exemption is an automatic benefit in some states while, in others, homeowners must file a claim with the state in order to receive it.\n", "\nSince a homestead property is considered a person's primary residence, no exemptions\u00a0can be claimed on other owned property, even residences. Further, if a surviving spouse moves their primary residence, they must re-file for the exemption.\n", "\nThe exemptions for homestead properties vary from state to state. A few states, including Florida and Texas, afford unlimited financial protection against unsecured creditors for the home, although acreage limits may apply for the protected property.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"9\"></span> More common, however, is a limit for protection from creditors that ranges between $5,000 and $500,000, depending on the state, with many states in the $30,000 to $50,000 range.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"16\"></span>\n", "\nHowever, the protection limits are not for the value of the home, but for the homeowner's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equity.asp\">equity</a> in it\u2014the value of the property minus the balance of the mortgage and other financial claims on that property.

For bankruptcy cases filed after April 1, 2019, federal bankruptcy law shields a home from sale if the owner's equity does not exceed $25,150. For cases brought before then, the exemption is $23,675.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\"></span><span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\"></span> In most states, homeowners are forced to use the state limits, which are often more favorable anyway.

The homestead tax can be a percentage of the property's value or a fixed amount.\n", "\nThe homestead tax exemption may offer ongoing reductions in property taxes depending on local state laws. These exemptions can help surviving spouses remain in their home after their income has been reduced by the death of their partner.\n", "\nHomestead tax exemptions usually offer a fixed discount on taxes, such as exempting the first $50,000 of the\u00a0assessed\u00a0value,\u00a0with the remainder taxed at the normal rate. For example, using a $50,000 homestead exemption,\u00a0a\u00a0home valued at $150,000 would be taxed on only $100,000 of assessed value, and a home valued at $75,000 would then be taxed on only $25,000.\n", "\nFixed homestead\u00a0tax exemptions essentially turn a property tax into a\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/progressivetax.asp\">progressive tax</a> that is more favorable to those with more modest homes.

Some states require you to fill out an application. Make sure you comply with your state's application deadlines.\n", "\nAlso, be aware that some sites may be fraudulent and may request payment to fill out an application. Your county or local tax assessor will not require you to pay a fee to fill out an application for homestead tax exemption.\n", "\nEligibility for the homestead exemption varies by state. Typically, you will be eligible if your income is low, you are a senior, you have a disability, or you are a veteran. Exemptions can be combined if you fall into more than one category. There may also be a limit on the value of a home that can qualify for an exemption. Check with your local tax assessor.\n", "\nMost states have homestead exemptions. New Jersey\u00a0and Pennsylvania do not have homestead exemptions while Massachusetts and Rhode Island have set their exemption limit at $500,000. Some states have general homestead laws instead\u2014for example, laws that protect surviving spouses from creditors.\n", "\nTo qualify for the homestead exemption in Florida, individuals must occupy the property as their permanent residence prior to January 1 of the year for which they are applying. An applicant must be a U.S. citizen or a permanent U.S. resident and a Florida resident. Applicants cannot be claiming or receiving any type of tax exemption on any other property in the United States. An exemption application must be completed and submitted to the property appraiser in the county where the property is located\u00a0by the statutory deadline of March 1.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"13\"></span>\n", "\nThe homestead exemption in Florida provides a tax exemption up to $50,000. The first $25,000 applies to all property taxes, including school district taxes.

In some states, homestead protection is automatic; however, in others, homeowners must file a claim for homestead exemption with the state.\n"]}
