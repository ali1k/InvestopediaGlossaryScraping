The method focuses on three factors: the manager\u2019s investment style, their specific stock picks and the market timing of those decisions. It attempts to provide a quantitative analysis of the aspects of a fund manager\u2019s investment selections and philosophy that lead to that fund\u2019s performance.\n", "\nAttribution analysis begins by identifying the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetclasses.asp\">asset class</a> in which a fund manager chooses to invest. This will provide a general <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/benchmark.asp\">benchmark</a> for comparison of performance. An asset class generally describes the type of securities that a manager chooses and the marketplace in which they originate. European fixed income or U.S. technology equities could both be examples.\n", "\nThe next step in attribution analysis is to determine the manager\u2019s <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investing_style.asp\">investment style</a>. Like the class identification discussed above, a style will provide a benchmark against which to gauge the manager\u2019s performance. The first method of style analysis concentrates on the manager\u2019s holdings. Are they large-cap or small-cap? Value or growth? <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/william-f-sharpe.asp\">Bill Sharpe</a> introduced the second type of style analysis 1988. Returns-based style analysis (RBSA) charts a fund\u2019s returns and seeks an index with comparable performance history. Sharpe refined this method with a technique that he called quadratic optimization, which allowed him to assign a blend of indices that correlated most closely to a manager\u2019s returns.\n", "\nOnce an attribution analyst identifies that blend, they can formulate a customized benchmark of returns against which they can evaluate the manager\u2019s performance. Such an analysis should shine a light on the excess returns, or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/alpha.asp\">alpha</a>, that the manager enjoys over those benchmarks. The next step in attribution analysis attempts to explain that alpha. Is it due to the manager\u2019s stock picks, selection of sectors, or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/markettiming.asp\">market timing</a>? To determine the alpha generated by their stock picks, an analyst must identify and subtract the portion of the alpha attributable to sector and timing. Again, this can be done by developing customize benchmarks based on the manager\u2019s selected blend of sectors and the timing of their trades. If the alpha of the fund is 13 percent, it is possible to assign a certain slice of that 13 percent to sector selection and timing of entry and exit from those sectors. The remainder will be stock selection alpha.\n", "\nAcademic research on the significance of market timing in manager evaluation has led to a wide range of conclusions on the importance of timing. In general, most analysis of the subject agrees that stock selection and investment style result in a greater share of a manager\u2019s performance than timing. Some scholars point out that a significant portion of a manager\u2019s performance with respect to timing is random, or luck. To the extent that market timing can be measured, scholars point out the importance of gauging a manager\u2019s returns against benchmarks reflective of upturns and downturns. Ideally, the fund will go up in bullish times and will decline less than the market in bearish periods. Because this is the most difficult part of attribute analysis to put into quantitative terms, most analysts attribute less significance to market timing than\u00a0stock selection and investment style.\n"]}
