These expenses are related to the organization as a whole, as opposed to individual departments or business units. Administrative expenses include salaries of senior executives and costs associated with general services, for example, accounting and information technology. They tend to be unrelated to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/122314/what-difference-between-gross-margin-and-contribution-margin.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">gross margins</a>.\n", "\nCompanies incur administrative expenses to perform basic operations, increase efficiency or comply with laws and regulations.

For example, a business will always use some minimum level of electricity to keep the lights on. Beyond that point, it can take measures to reduce its electric bill.\n", "\nBecause a business can eliminate administrative expenses without a direct impact on the product it sells or produces, these costs are typically first in line for budget cuts. Management is strongly motivated to maintain low administrative expenses relative to other costs, as this allows a business to utilize <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leverage.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">leverage</a> more effectively. The sales-to-administrative expense ratio helps companies to measure how much sales revenue is being portioned to covering administrative costs.\n", "\nCompanies can deduct from their tax returns administrative expenses that are reasonable, ordinary and necessary for business operations. These expenses must be incurred during the usual course of business and deducted in the year they are incurred.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nWages and benefits to certain employees, such as accounting and IT staff, are considered administrative expenses.

Internally, this allows management to make decisions about expanding or reducing individual business units.\n", "\nFor example, if XYZ Company spends $4,000 monthly on electricity and records this as an administrative expense, it might allocate the cost according to the square footage each individual department occupies.
