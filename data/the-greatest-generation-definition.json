The term \"the Greatest Generation\" is thought to have been coined by former NBC Nightly News anchor and author Tom Brokaw in his book by the same name.\n", "\nThere are no precise dates that define when members of the Greatest Generation were born, though many give a range of the early 1900s to the mid-1920s. The common characteristic of Greatest Generation members is that they lived through and experienced the hardships of the Great Depression and later either fought in World War II or worked in the industries that contributed to winning the war.\n", "\nNewsman Tom Brokaw is often credited with popularizing the term through his book, \"The Greatest Generation,\"<em> </em>which profiled people who came of age during World War II and was inspired by Brokaw's attendance at the 40th-anniversary commemoration of the D-Day invasion of mainland Europe. Brokaw's profiles focused on the soldiers who fought the war, as well as the workers whose labor provided the essential material and services in support of them. The Greatest Generation is also known as the \"G.I. Generation\" or the \"WWII Generation.\"\n", "\nIn Australia, the Greatest Generation is known as the \"Federation Generation.\"\n", "\nThe youngest members of the Greatest Generation, if using 1925 as the last year they were born, would be in their 100s as of the year 2020.
