They do not include taxes charged for home renovations or for services like trash collection.\n", "\nAs noted below, the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/taxes/trumps-tax-reform-plan-explained/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tax Cuts and Jobs Act</a> (TCJA) capped the property tax deduction, along with other state and local taxes, starting with 2018 taxes. The law capped the deduction for state and local taxes, including property taxes, at $10,000 ($5,000 if married filing separately). Previously, there was no limit on the deduction.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nThe owner of a property must pay taxes, assessed annually by a state and/or local government, on the value of the property.

Personal property, according to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), may include a taxpayer\u2019s main home, vacation home, land, or foreign property.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nTaxes paid on rental or commercial property\u2014and on property not owned by the taxpayer\u2014can not be deducted. In addition, a homebuyer who pays the seller's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/back-taxes.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">delinquent taxes</a> from an earlier year at the time the sale was closed cannot deduct these tax payments on their tax return. This delinquent tax payment is, instead, treated as part of the cost of buying the home.\n", "\nAlso, a property owner\u2019s tax bill includes miscellaneous items that are not allowed to be deducted for tax purposes. Some of these items include payments for improvements made to a local residential area, such as sidewalks, and fees for service delivery, such as trash collection. To understand what portion of a tax bill qualifies for the deduction, refer to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/form_1098.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Form 1098</a>, which is reported by the bank or lender to the IRS and sent to the property owner.\n", "\nTo claim a property tax deduction, the tax must apply only to the value of the personal property owned and be charged on an annual basis, irrespective of when the government collects it from you. Therefore, if the state tax was only charged at the time the property was purchased then it does not meet the IRS definition of a deductible personal property tax.\n", "\nAs stated earlier, property tax can only be deducted if the owner chooses to itemize deductions. It makes sense for a taxpayer to itemize deductions if the sum of all their eligible itemized expenses is greater than the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standarddeduction.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">standard deduction</a> allowed in a given tax year.\n", "\nFrom time to time there is talk of eliminating the property tax deduction.

Proponents of retaining the property tax deduction say that it promotes homeownership.\n", "\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 capped the deduction for state and local taxes, including property taxes, at a total of $10,000 ($5,000 if married filing separately), starting in 2018.
