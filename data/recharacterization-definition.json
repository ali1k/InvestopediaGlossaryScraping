As many provisions of the 2017 tax bill were mandated to end in the 2026 tax year, this text will describe how recharacterizations\u00a0have worked, in case the option returns in the future.\n", "\nWhen talking about IRAs, recharacterizations and conversions are essentially opposite actions. A conversion refers to taking assets in a traditional IRA\u2014or a similar type of retirement account involving pre-tax dollars\u2014and moving them into a Roth IRA. A recharacterization reverses a conversion (or rollover). In either action, tax considerations play a part.\n", "\nThe deadline for recharacterizing a traditional IRA (or other retirement plan) to a Roth IRA conversion was the extended tax deadline of Oct. 15. Meeting that deadline meant you could treat any contribution as a traditional IRA contribution (not taxed).\n", "\nFor example, if you converted in 2019, you would have had until Oct. 15, 2020, to complete a recharacterization. You could also amend and submit a new tax return if you had already filed taxes for the conversion year. Upon recharacterization, you would need to wait until either 30 days or until the next calendar year (whichever was longer) to reconvert to a Roth IRA.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nFilling out IRS <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/form-8606.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Form 8606</a>\u00a0was required to perform a recharacterization.

This introduced\u00a0several tax planning decisions, such as whether it made sense to make the conversion over many years or wait until a year that you were likely to be in a lower tax bracket.\n", "\nThe upside of a conversion to a Roth IRA came with added flexibility in taking distributions.
