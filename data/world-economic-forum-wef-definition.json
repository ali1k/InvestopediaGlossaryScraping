These include but are not limited to issues of politics, economics, social, and environmental concerns.\n", "\nThe World Economic Forum\u2019s membership features a cross section of representatives from the private and public sector, and includes some of the most prominent CEOs, ambassadors, public figures, media personnel, government officials, religious leaders and union representatives from around the world.\n", "\nFounded in\u00a01971\u00a0in Geneva, the current World Economic Forum has a mission based on what is known as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stakeholder.asp\">stakeholder</a> theory. Stakeholder theory offers\u00a0a proposal that while a private sector entity\u2019s role is to increase profits for its shareholders, it is contingent upon the organization to view the rest of society as having a stake in the company\u2019s actions.\u00a0Stakeholders such as employees, customers the company serves, and the local and global community are to be considered in making key decisions.\n", "\nHeadquartered in Switzerland, the World Economic Forum also has offices in New York, Beijing, and Tokyo, but in 2017 announced a new office in San Francisco.\u00a0The most recent annual meeting in Davos was held in January of 2018, and its theme was titled\u00a0Creating a Shared Future in a Fractured World.\n", "\nThe World Economic Forum is funded by its own membership, which includes industry leaders from companies with at least $5 billion in yearly turnover, as well as individuals from all walks of life, including\u00a0celebrities, journalists, and interested individuals willing to pay annual dues and meeting fees to attend. Regional meetings are held in developing nations such as Africa, East Asia, and Latin America, but the annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland is the central meeting event for all members.\n", "\nWorld Economic Forum meetings serve the purpose of introducing new issues, trends, and organizations to members and to the public for discussion, and are believed to help evolve corporate and public sector agendas for future decision making.\n", "\nThe World Economic Forum also produces research into areas of interest to its members, and helps to guide public-private sector collaboration and communication among its membership.\n", "\nThe World Economic Forum annual meeting in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/07/minimum_wage.asp\">Davos</a>, Switzerland attracts about 2,500 people from over a hundred countries. The Davos meeting is generally covered by the world press whereby past Davos meetings have allowed government leaders from around the world to address issues of political conflict with one another, raising\u00a0the stature of the yearly meeting to that of a political as well as an economic forum. This was an early vision of Forum founder Klaus Schwab, a\u00a0professor of business at the University of Geneva, whereby the Forum could assist with global conflict resolution in addition to promoting its own best practices in business management. Schwab now serves as the Executive Chairman of the World Economic Forum.\n", "\nThe Davos World Economic Forum brings together business leaders, investors, politicians and journalists from across the globe to discuss current global economic and social issues and is held in January in the small ski town. It is one of the best-known events of its sort. The\u00a0forum is\u00a0among the most popular, well-attended and high-profile events globally and\u00a0focuses on shaping the global, regional and industry agendas.\n", "\nEach year's Forum has a theme, and the theme of the most recent forum held in January\u00a02018 was\u00a0\u201cCreating a Shared Future in a Fractured World.\u201d\u00a0The fractures referred\u00a0to\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brexit.asp\">Brexit</a>, the Trump presidency, the rise of automation and\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/artificial-intelligence-ai.asp\">artificial intelligence</a>\u00a0(AI), and the re-emergence of China. These subjects were highly visible on the conference agenda.\u00a0The 2018 Davos World Economic Forum had record attendance and was the 47th Forum since its inception.\n", "\nAdvancing technology, particularly AI, and the impact that automation will have on jobs was a prominent item of discussion. The discussions at Davos concluded that although some jobs will undoubtedly disappear over time, there will still be many\u00a0jobs for humans in the future;\u00a0the work will just be quite different.\n", "\nIn an optimistic forecast, one technology company that attended Davos\u00a0estimated that approximately 20 million jobs will be created in the next decade as AI and automation are\u00a0integrated with human skills\u00a0in future technology advancements.\u00a0Digital transformation of organizations was also encouraged to meet the growing digital environment. Despite the need for firms to embrace new digital technologies, the WEF found that only 7% of firms have done so, according to research by Forrester.\n"]}
