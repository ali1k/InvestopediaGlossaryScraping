Fintech, the word, is a combination of \"financial technology\".\u00a0\n", "\nWhen fintech\u00a0emerged in the 21st\u00a0Century, the term was\u00a0initially applied to the technology employed at the back-end systems of established\u00a0financial institutions. \u200bSince then, however, there has been a shift to more consumer-oriented services\u00a0and therefore a more consumer-oriented definition. Fintech now includes different sectors and industries such as education, retail banking, fundraising and nonprofit, and investment management to name a few.\n", "\nFintech\u00a0also includes\u00a0the development and use of crypto-currencies\u00a0such as\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bitcoin.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bitcoin</a>. While that segment of fintech\u00a0may see the most headlines, the big money still lies in the traditional global\u00a0banking\u00a0industry and its multi-trillion-dollar\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">market capitalization</a>.\n", "\nBroadly, the term \"financial technology\" can apply to any innovation in how people transact business, from the invention of digital money to double-entry bookkeeping. Since the internet revolution and the mobile internet/smartphone revolution, however, financial technology has grown explosively, and fintech, which originally referred to computer technology applied to the back office of banks or trading firms, now describes a broad variety of technological interventions into personal and commercial finance.\n", "\nFintech\u00a0now describes a variety of financial activities, such as\u00a0money transfers, depositing a check with your smartphone, bypassing a bank branch to apply for credit, raising\u00a0money for a business startup, or managing\u00a0your investments,\u00a0generally without the assistance of a person. According to EY's\u00a02017 Fintech Adoption Index, one-third of consumers utilize at least two or more fintech services and those consumers are also increasingly aware of fintech as a part of their daily lives.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nThe most talked-about (and most funded) fintech startups share the same characteristic: they are designed to be a threat to, challenge,\u00a0and eventually\u00a0usurp entrenched traditional financial services providers by being more nimble, serving an underserved segment or providing faster and/or better service.\n", "\nFor example, Affirm seeks to cut credit card companies out of the online shopping process by offering a way for consumers to secure immediate, short-term loans for purchases. While rates can be high, Affirm claims to offer a way for consumers with poor or no credit a way to both secure credits and also build\u00a0their credit histories. Similarly, Better Mortgage seeks to streamline the home mortgage process (and obviate traditional mortgage brokers)\u00a0with a digital-only offering that can reward users with a verified pre-approval letter within 24 hours of applying. GreenSky\u00a0seeks to link home improvement borrowers with banks by helping consumers avoid entrenched lenders and save on interest by offering zero-interest promotional periods.\n", "\nFor consumers with no or poor credit, Tala offers consumers in the developing world microloans by doing a deep data dig on their smartphones for\u00a0their transaction history and seemingly unrelated things, such as\u00a0what mobile games they play. Tala seeks to give such consumers better options than local banks, unregulated lenders and other <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/microfinance.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">microfinance</a>\u00a0institutions.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nIn short, if you have ever wondered why some aspect of\u00a0your financial life was so unpleasant (such as applying for a mortgage with a traditional lender) or felt like it wasn't quite the right fit, fintech\u00a0probably has (or seeks to have) a solution\u00a0for you. For example, fintech seeks to answer questions like, \"Why is what makes up\u00a0my\u00a0FICO score so mysterious and how it is used to judge my creditworthiness?\"\n", "\nAs such, loan originator Upstart wants to make <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fico-fair-isaac.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FICO</a>\u00a0(as well as other lenders both traditional and fintech) obsolete by using different data sets to determine creditworthiness.

The scope of these services encompassed a broad range from traditional banking activities to mortgage and trading services. In its most basic form, Fintech unbundles these services into individual offerings. The combination of streamlined offerings with technology enables fintech companies to be more efficient and cut down on costs associated with each transaction.\n", "\nIf one word can describe how many fintech innovations have affected traditional trading, banking, financial advice, and products, it's 'disruption,' like financial products and services that were once the realm of branches, salesmen and desktops move toward mobile devices or simply <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/tech/how-fintech-disrupting-wealth-management/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">democratize away from large, entrenched institutions</a>.\n", "\nFor example, the mobile-only stock trading app <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/robinhood-review-4587919\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Robinhood</a> charges no fees for trades, and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/peer-to-peer-lending.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">peer-to-peer lending</a> sites like Prosper Marketplace, Lending Club and OnDeck\u00a0promise to reduce rates by opening up competition for loans to broad market forces. Business loan providers such as Kabbage, Lendio, Accion and Funding Circle (among others) offer startup and established businesses easy, fast platforms to secure working capital. Oscar, an online insurance startup, received $165 million in funding in March 2018.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff Such significant funding rounds are not unusual and occur globally for fintech startups.\n", "\nEntrenched, traditional banks have been paying attention, however, and have invested heavily into becoming more like the companies that seek to disrupt them. For example, investment bank Goldman Sachs launched consumer lending platform Marcus in 2016 and recently expanded its operations to the United Kingdom.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"5\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nThat said, many tech-savvy industry watchers warn that keeping apace of fintech-inspired innovations requires more than just ramped up tech spend.\u00a0Rather, competing with lighter-on-their-feet startups requires a significant change in thinking, processes, decision-making, and even overall corporate structure.\n", "\nNew technologies, like <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/machine-learning.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">machine learning</a>/<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/artificial-intelligence-ai.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">artificial intelligence</a>, predictive behavioral analytics, and data-driven marketing, will take the guesswork and habit out of financial decisions. \"Learning\" apps will not only learn the habits of users, often hidden to themselves, but will engage users in learning games to make their automatic, unconscious spending and saving decisions better. Fintech is also a keen adaptor of automated customer service technology, utilizing <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/chatbot.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">chatbots</a> to and AI interfaces to assist customers with basic task and also keep down staffing costs. Fintech\u00a0is also being leveraged to fight fraud by leveraging information about payment history to flag transactions that are outside the norm.\n", "\nFintech startups received $17.4 billion in funding in 2016 and were on pace to surpass that sum as of late 2017, according to CB Insights, which counted 26 fintech <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unicorn.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">unicorns</a> globally valued at $83.8 billion. The same firm reported that there were 39 VC-backed fintech unicorns worth $147.37 billion by the end of 2018.\n", "\nNorth America\u00a0produces most of the fintech startups, with Asia a relatively close second. Global fintech\u00a0funding hit a new high in the first quarter of 2018 let by a significant uptick in deals in North America. Asia, which could surpass the United States in fintech deals,\u00a0also saw a spike in activity.\u00a0Funding activity in Europe was at a five-quarter low in Q1 2018 but surged back in Q2.\u00a0\n", "\nSome of the most active areas of fintech innovation include or revolve around the following areas:\n", "\nThere are four broad categories of users for fintech: 1) B2B for banks and 2) their business clients, and 3) B2C for small businesses and 4) consumers. Trends toward mobile banking, increased information, data, and more accurate analytics and decentralization of access will create opportunities for all four groups to interact in heretofore unprecedented ways.\n", "\nAs for consumers, as with most technology, the younger you are the more likely it will be that you are aware of and can accurately describe what fintech is. The fact is that consumer-oriented fintech is mostly targeted toward millennials given the huge size and rising earning (and inheritance) potential of that much-talked-about segment. Some fintech\u00a0watchers believe that this focus on millennials has more to do with the size of that\u00a0marketplace than the ability and interest of Gen Xers and Baby Boomers in using fintech. Rather, fintech\u00a0tends to offer little to older consumers because it fails to address their problems.\n", "\nWhen it comes to businesses, before the advent and adoption of fintech, a business owner or startup would have\u00a0gone to a\u00a0bank to secure financing or startup capital. If they intended to accept credit card payments they would have to establish a relationship with a credit provider and even install infrastructure, such as a landline-connected card reader. Now, with mobile technology, those hurdles are\u00a0a thing of the past.\n", "\nFinancial services are among the most heavily regulated sectors in the world. Not surprisingly, regulation has emerged as the number one concern among governments as fintech companies take off.\n", "\nAs technology is integrated into financial services processes, regulatory problems for such companies have multiplied. In some instances, the problems are a function of technology. In others, they are a reflection of the tech industry's impatience to disrupt finance.\n", "\nFor example, automation of processes and digitization of data makes fintech systems vulnerable to attacks from hackers. Recent i<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/pa8emg/russian-indicted-jp-morgan-chase-hack\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">nstances of hacks</a> at <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/equifaxs-hack-one-year-later-a-look-back-at-how-it-happened-and-whats-changed/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">credit card companies</a> and banks are illustrations of the ease with which bad actors can gain access to systems and cause irreparable damage. The most important questions for consumers in such cases will pertain to the responsibility for such attacks as well as misuse of personal information and important financial data.\n", "\nThere have also been instances where the collision of a technology culture that believes in a \"<a data-component=\"amazon\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"affiliate\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Move-Fast-Break-Things-Undermined/dp/0316275778\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Move fast and break things</a>\" philosophy with the conservative and risk-averse world of finance has produced undesirable results. San Francisco-based insurtech startup Zenefits, which was valued at over a billion dollars in private markets, broke California's insurance laws by allowing unlicensed brokers to sell its products and underwrite insurance policies. The SEC fined the firm $980,000 and they had to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2016/11/29/zenefits-fined-7-million-for-california-insurance-violations/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pay</a> $7 million to California's Department of Insurance.\n", "\nRegulation is also a problem in the emerging world of cryptocurrencies. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/initial-coin-offering-ico.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Initial coin offerings</a> (ICOs) are a new form of fundraising that allows startups to raise capital directly from lay investors. In most countries, they are unregulated and have become fertile ground for scams and frauds. Regulatory uncertainty for ICOs has also allowed entrepreneurs to slip security tokens disguised as utility tokens past the SEC to avoid fees and compliance costs.\n", "\nBecause of the diversity of offerings in fintech and the disparate industries it touches, it is difficult to formulate a single and comprehensive approach to these problems. For the most part, governments have used existing regulations and, in some cases, customized them to regulate fintech.\n", "\nThey have established fintech sandboxes to evaluate the implications of technology in the sector. The passing of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">General Data Protection Regulation</a>, a framework for collecting and using personal data, in the EU is another attempt to limit the amount of personal data available to banks. Several countries where ICOs are popular, such as Japan and South Korea, have also taken the lead in developing regulations for such offerings to protect investors.\n"]}
