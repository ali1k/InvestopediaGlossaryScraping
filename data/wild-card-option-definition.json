It permits the seller of a Treasury bond to postpone delivery of its <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underlying.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">underlying asset</a> until after regular trading hours.\u00a0\n", "\nThis option benefits the seller because it allows them to benefit from a few hours\u2019 extra time in which to secure a favorable price before settling their futures contract.\n", "\nU.S. Treasury bond futures contracts have been traded on the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cbot.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT)</a> commodity exchange since 1977.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff Under the rules of the CBOT, trading in the Treasury futures market is terminated at 2:00 pm, but traders that have sold Treasury futures are not required to settle their contracts until 8:00 pm.\u00a0\n", "\nThe amount that the short seller must pay in order to compensate the holder of the f<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futures.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">utures contract</a>\u2014known as the contract\u2019s invoice price\u2014is set as of 2:00pm. Because of the wild card option, however, Treasury futures sellers have the option of waiting for up to six hours, during which time they might benefit from favorable price movements during <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/saleafterhours.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">after-hours trading</a>.\n", "\nWhen exercising the wild card option, the seller of the Treasury futures contract would wait to see whether the spot price declines below the invoice price during after hours trading.

To illustrate how a wild card option works in practice, consider the case of ABC Capital, a hypothetical investment firm that has taken a short position in the Treasury market by selling Treasury bond futures contracts. As the seller of the Treasury bonds, ABC Capital is obligated to deliver a specified quantity of Treasury bonds to the buyer, at a predetermined time. Once the settlement date is reached, however, ABC Capital can opt to use the wild card option <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/031513/guide-embedded-options-bonds.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">embedded</a> in its futures contract.\n", "\nOn the settlement date, ABC Capital can therefore wait for up to 6 hours following the end of the trading day before announcing its intention to deliver the bonds. During those 6 hours, the market price of bonds during after-hours trading might sink, giving ABC Capital the chance to purchase bonds at a more favorable price before rendering them to the buyer. This in turn would lower the cost of ABC Capital\u2019s short position, thereby increasing their profit or reducing their loss.\n"]}
