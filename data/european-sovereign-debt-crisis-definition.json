It has led to a loss of confidence in\u00a0European businesses and economies.\n", "\nThe crisis was eventually controlled by the financial guarantees of European countries, who feared the collapse of the euro and financial contagion, and by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Rating\u00a0agencies downgraded several Eurozone countries' debts.\n", "\nGreece's\u00a0debt was,\u00a0at one point, moved to junk status. Countries receiving bailout funds were required to meet <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/austerity.asp\">austerity measures</a> designed to slow down the growth of public-sector debt as part of the loan agreements.\n", "\nSome of the contributing causes included the financial crisis of 2007 to 2008, the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/great-recession.asp\">Great Recession</a> of 2008 to 2012, the real estate market crisis, and property <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bubble.asp\">bubbles</a> in several countries. The peripheral states\u2019 fiscal policies regarding government expenses and revenues also contributed.\n", "\nBy the end of 2009, the peripheral Eurozone member states of Greece, Spain, Ireland, Portugal, and Cyprus were unable to repay or refinance their government debt\u00a0or bail out their beleaguered banks without the assistance of third-party financial institutions. These included the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/europeancentralbank.asp\">European Central Bank</a> (ECB), the IMF,\u00a0and, eventually, the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/european-financial-stability-facility.asp\">European Financial Stability Facility</a> (EFSF).\n", "\nAlso in 2009,\u00a0Greece revealed that\u00a0its previous government had grossly underreported its budget deficit, signifying a violation of EU policy and spurring fears of a euro collapse via political and financial contagion.\n", "\nSeventeen Eurozone countries voted to create the EFSF in 2010, specifically to address and assist with the crisis. The European sovereign debt crisis peaked between 2010 and 2012.\n", "\nWith increasing fear of excessive <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sovereign-debt.asp\">sovereign debt</a>, lenders demanded higher <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp\">interest rates</a> from Eurozone states in 2010, with high debt and deficit levels\u00a0making it harder for these countries to finance their budget deficits when they were faced with overall low economic growth. Some affected countries raised taxes and slashed expenditures to combat the crisis, which contributed to social upset within their borders and a crisis of confidence in leadership, particularly in Greece. Several of these countries, including Greece, Portugal, and Ireland had their sovereign debt downgraded to junk status by international credit rating agencies during this crisis, worsening investor fears.\n", "\nA <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R42377.pdf\">2012 report for the United States Congress</a> stated,\u00a0\u201cThe Eurozone debt crisis began in late 2009\u00a0when a new Greek government revealed that previous governments had been misreporting government budget data. Higher than expected deficit levels eroded investor confidence\u00a0causing <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp\">bond</a>\u00a0spreads to rise to unsustainable levels. Fears quickly spread that the fiscal positions and debt levels of a number of Eurozone countries were unsustainable.\"\n", "\nIn early 2010, the developments were reflected in rising spreads on <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sovereignbond.asp\">sovereign bond</a> yields between the affected peripheral member states of Greece, Ireland, Portugal,\u00a0Spain\u00a0and, most notably, Germany.\n", "\nThe Greek yield diverged with Greece needing Eurozone assistance by May 2010. Greece received several bailouts from the EU and IMF over the following years in exchange for the adoption of\u00a0EU-mandated austerity measures to cut public spending and a significant\u00a0increase in\u00a0taxes. The country's economic recession continued. These measures, along with the economic situation, caused social unrest. With divided political and fiscal\u00a0leadership,\u00a0Greece faced\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sovereign-default.asp\">sovereign default</a> in June 2015.\n", "\nThe Greek citizens\u00a0voted against a bailout and further EU austerity measures the following month. This decision raised\u00a0the possibility that\u00a0Greece might leave\u00a0the European Monetary Union (EMU) entirely.\n", "\nThe withdrawal of a nation from the EMU would have been unprecedented, and if Greece had returned to using the Drachma, the speculated effects on its economy ranged from total economic collapse to a surprise recovery.\n", "\nIn the end, Greece remained part of the EMU and began to slowly show signs of recovery in subsequent years. Unemployment dropped from its high of over 27% to the 16% in five years, while annual GDP when from negative numbers to a projected rate of over two percent in that same time.\n", "\nIn June\u00a02016, the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union in a referendum. This vote fueled Eurosceptics across the continent, and speculation soared that\u00a0other countries would leave\u00a0the EU. After a drawn-out negotiation process, Brexit took place at 11pm Greenwich Mean Time, Jan. 31,\u00a02020, and did not precipitate any groundswell of sentiment in other countries to depart the EMU.\n", "\nIt's a common perception that this movement grew\u00a0during the debt crisis, and\u00a0campaigns have described the EU as a \"sinking ship.\" The UK referendum sent shock\u00a0waves through the economy. Investors fled to safety, pushing several government yields to a negative value, and the British pound was at its lowest against the dollar since 1985. The S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones\u00a0plunged,\u00a0then recovered in the following weeks until they hit all-time highs as investors ran out of investment options because of the negative <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond-yield.asp\">yields</a>.\n", "\nA combination of market volatility triggered by Brexit, questionable performance of politicians, and a\u00a0poorly managed financial system\u00a0worsened the situation for Italian banks in mid-2016. A\u00a0staggering 17% of Italian loans, approximately\u00a0$400 billion-worth, were junk, and the banks needed a significant bailout.\n", "\nA full collapse\u00a0of the Italian banks is arguably a bigger risk to the European economy than a Greek, Spanish, or Portuguese\u00a0collapse because Italy's economy is much larger. Italy has repeatedly asked for help from the EU, but the EU recently introduced \"<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bailin.asp\">bail-in</a>\" rules that prohibit\u00a0countries from bailing out financial institutions with taxpayer\u00a0money without investors taking the first loss. Germany\u00a0has been clear that the EU will not bend these rules for Italy.\n", "\nIreland followed Greece in requiring a bailout in November 2010,\u00a0with Portugal following in May 2011. Italy and Spain were also vulnerable. Spain and Cyprus required\u00a0official assistance in June 2012.\n", "\nThe situation in Ireland, Portugal, and Spain\u00a0had improved by 2014, due to various fiscal reforms, domestic austerity measures, and other unique economic factors. However, the road to full\u00a0economic recovery\u00a0is anticipated to be a long one with an emerging banking crisis in Italy, instabilities that Brexit may trigger, and the economic impact of the COVID-19 outbreak as possible difficulties to overcome.\n"]}
