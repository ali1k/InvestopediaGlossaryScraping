It\u00a0stipulates that individual health insurance policies must contain certain provisions in order to be\u00a0valid.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nThe legislation was was created to establish a standard of quality and to ensure health insurance policies have an adequate level of coverage by requiring that certain provisions be written into every policy. It was written by\u00a0the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nainsurancec.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">National Association of Insurance Commissioners</a> (NAIC), a non-governmental organization that is\u00a0comprised of the insurance commissioners of every state and territory.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff The NAIC is not itself a regulator. Insurance markets are regulated at the state level.\u00a0\n", "\nThe 12 mandatory provisions include the rights and obligations of both the insurer and the insured. Among the burdens that fall on the insurer are the need to include any relevant information within the original policy or official amendments, the requirement of a stated\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/grace_period.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">grace period</a>\u00a0for delinquent premium payments, and instructions for\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reinstatement-clause.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reinstatement</a>\u00a0of a policyholder who misses that grace period. The provisions that cover the responsibilities of the policyholder include requirements that they notify the insurer of a claim within 20 days of a loss, provide proof of the extent of that loss, and update beneficiary information when changes take place.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nAfter the 12 mandatory provisions, insurers may include any of 11 optional clauses in a policy. The policyholder and the insurer can negotiate which of these provisions will be part of the policy, but generally, the insurer will have the final say.\u00a0The 11 optional provisions tend to place more of\u00a0a burden on the insured to comply with certain requirements than on the insurer. These requirements include the obligation to inform the insurer of changes in income, especially if due to a disability, or changes to a more or less\u00a0dangerous occupation. The optional clauses also state that any misstatements regarding age, use of illegal substances, or engagement in illegal occupations will have an adverse impact on the insured\u2019s ability to collect on\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurance_claim.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">claims</a>\u00a0otherwise covered by a policy.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n"]}
