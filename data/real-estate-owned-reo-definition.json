A lender\u2014often a bank or quasi-governmental entity\u00a0such as Fannie Mae or\u00a0Freddie Mac\u2014takes ownership of a foreclosed property when it fails to sell at the amount sought to cover the loan.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nWhen a borrower defaults on their\u00a0mortgage, the pre-foreclosure period often involves either a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/real-estate-short-sale.asp\">real estate short sale</a> or a public auction. If neither goes through, the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreclosure.asp\">foreclosure</a> process can end with the lender\u2014a bank, for example\u2014taking\u00a0ownership of the property.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff Banks\u00a0may attempt to sell REO properties in their portfolios without the help of real estate agents. When this is the case, banks often list their REO properties on their websites. A bank's\u00a0loan officers may\u00a0also notify customers looking for homes about the REO properties in its portfolio.\n", "\nA bank's REO specialist manages its REO properties by marketing\u00a0the properties, reviewing\u00a0any offers, preparing\u00a0regular reports on the status of properties in the bank's portfolio, and tracking\u00a0down <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deed.asp\">deeds</a>. The REO specialist also works closely with the bank's in-house or contracted property manager to ensure properties are secure and winterized or to prepare a property for vacancy. The REO specialist undertakes these job functions to help the bank liquidate its properties quickly and efficiently.\n", "\nTo give REO properties the widest exposure, REO specialists often contract the services of local real estate agents to list the properties in the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/multiple-listing-service-mls.asp\">multiple listing service (MLS)</a>. Listing REO properties in the MLS ensures that interested real estate seekers using websites such as Zillow, Realtor.com, Redfin, and Trulia\u2014as well as local real estate websites\u2014will see the listings. An REO property's listing agent brings any offers he receives to the REO specialist. Real estate agents negotiate the commission they will receive for selling REO properties with the REO specialist.\n", "\nREO properties can be attractive to real estate investors and homebuyers because\u00a0banks may, in some cases, sell them at a discount to their market value since selling such properties is not typically their\u00a0primary business line. However, banks typically sell REO properties \"as is,\" meaning the bank will not make any repairs prior to selling. These properties are often in disrepair, so it's crucial to have a thorough inspection and be prepared to make (and pay for) necessary renovations.\n"]}
