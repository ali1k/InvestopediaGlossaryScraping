Tom Padgett, an insurance claims adjuster, conspired with Minkow to forge documents crediting ZZZZ Best for restoration work and use Interstate Appraisal Services as the source to verify the claims. Increasingly, investors and bankers developed an interest in ZZZZ Best based on fraudulent <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-statements.asp\">financial statements</a> produced by Minkow\u2019s firm.\u00a0\n", "\nAs the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/ponzischeme.asp\">Ponzi scheme</a> continued, ZZZZ Best experienced significant cash flow problems.\u00a0As a solution, Minkow planned to acquire KeyServ, Sears' authorized carpet cleaner, for $25 million.\u00a0According to Minkow, the revenues from KeyServ would provide enough cash flow to end the Ponzi scheme.\u00a0Before the deal was closed, the jilted homemaker sparked a campaign against ZZZZ Best that would expose more than the fraud committed against her.\u00a0\n", "\nThe <em>L.A. Times</em> featured her story, which caused ZZZZ Best's stock price to decline sharply.\u00a0Lenders began to call their loans and more investigations commenced, unraveling Minkow's dark web of deceit and fraud.\u00a0Eventually, the truth behind the fictitious companies was revealed and the Ponzi scheme was exposed.\n", "\nTo launch an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ipo.asp\">IPO</a>, the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp\">Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</a> requires a firm to compile a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/prospectus.asp\">prospectus</a>, which must include a set of audited financial statements. Independent CPA firm Ernst &amp; Whinney (now Ernst &amp; Young) audited ZZZZ Best's financials to provide an opinion as to whether the financial statements were free of material misstatement.\u00a0Assuming an independent third party provided the paperwork, the CPAs used false appraisal documents to perform its audit.\u00a0When the CPA firm requested to visit a building refurbishing customer site, Minkow and his associates rented a building and created a bogus customer job site.\n", "\nIn January 1988, Minkow and 10 other company insiders were indicted by a grand jury on counts of racketeering, money laundering, securities fraud, embezzlement, mail fraud, bank fraud, and tax evasion.\u00a0Separately, Minkow was also indicted on counts of credit card fraud and mail fraud.\u00a0Approximately a year later, Minkow was found guilty on all charges, was sentenced to 25 years in prison and was ordered to pay over $26 million in restitution.\u00a0\n", "\nAfter his early release in 1995, he became an ordained minister and served as a pastor of a church in California.\u00a0Minkow informally investigated and reported other Ponzi schemes.\u00a0From this success, he formed the fraudulent Fraud Discovery Institute.\u00a0In 2011, he was again convicted for fraud and sentenced to five\u00a0years in prison.\u00a0A few years later, he was sentenced to an additional five years in prison for defrauding his church.\u00a0His restitution balance has increased ten-fold to $612 million.\n"]}
