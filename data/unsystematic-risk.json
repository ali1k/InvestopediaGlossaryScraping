It's also known as nonsystematic risk, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/specificrisk.asp\">specific risk</a>, diversifiable risk, or residual risk. In the context of an investment portfolio, unsystematic risk can be reduced through diversification\u2014while <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/systematic-risk/\">systematic risk</a> is the risk that's inherent in the market.\n", "\nUnsystematic risk can be described as the uncertainty inherent in a company or industry investment. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040715/what-are-some-common-examples-unsystematic-risk.asp\">Examples of unsystematic risk</a> include a new competitor in the marketplace with the potential to take significant market share from the company invested in,\u00a0a regulatory change\u00a0(which could drive down company sales),\u00a0a shift in management, or a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/product_recall.asp\">product recall</a>.\n", "\nWhile investors may be able to anticipate some sources of unsystematic risk, it is nearly impossible to be aware of all risks. For instance, an investor in healthcare stocks may be aware that a major shift in health policy is on the horizon, but may not fully know the particulars of the new laws and how companies and consumers will respond.\n", "\nOther examples of unsystematic risks may include strikes, outcomes of legal proceedings, or natural disasters. This risk is also known as a diversifiable risk since it can be eliminated by sufficiently diversifying a portfolio.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\"></span> There isn't a formula for calculating\u00a0unsystematic risk; instead, it must be extrapolated by subtracting the systematic risk from the total risk.\n", "\nBoth internal and external issues may cause business risk. Internal risks are tied to operational efficiencies, such as management failing to take out a patent to protect a new product would be an internal risk, as it may result in the loss of competitive advantage. The\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fda.asp\">Food and Drug Administration</a>\u00a0(FDA) banning a specific drug that a company sells is an example of external business risk.\n", "\nFinancial risk relates to the capital structure of a company. A company needs to have an optimal level of debt and equity to continue to grow and meet its financial obligations. A weak capital structure may lead to inconsistent earnings and cash flow that could prevent a company from trading.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operational_risk.asp\">Operational risks</a>\u00a0can result from unforeseen or negligent\u00a0events, such as a breakdown in the supply chain or a critical\u00a0error being overlooked in the manufacturing process. A security breach could expose confidential information about customers or other types of key proprietary data to criminals.\u00a0\n", "\nOperational risk is tied to operations and the potential for failed systems or policies. These are the risks for day-to-day operations and can result from breakdowns in internal procedures, whether tied to systems or employees.\n", "\nA strategic risk may occur if a business gets stuck selling goods or services in a dying industry without a solid plan to evolve the company's offerings. A company may also encounter this risk by entering into a flawed partnership with another firm or competitor that hurts their future prospects for growth.\u00a0\n", "\nLegal and regulatory risk is the risk that a change in laws or regulations will hurt a business. These changes can increase operational costs or introduce legal hurdles. More drastic legal or regulation changes can even stop a business from operating altogether. Other types of legal risk can include errors in agreements or violations of laws.\n", "\nTotal risk for investments is unsystematic risk plus systematic risk. Unsystematic risk is a risk specific to a company or industry, while <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/systematicrisk.asp\">systematic risk</a> is the risk tied to the broader market. Systematic risk is attributed to broad market factors and is the investment portfolio risk that is not based on individual investments.\u00a0\n", "\nTypes of systematic risks can include interest rate changes, recessions, or inflation. Systematic risk is often calculated with <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beta.asp\">beta</a>, which measures the volatility<em> </em>of a stock or portfolio relative to the entire market. Meanwhile, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/company-risk.asp\">company risk</a> is a bit more difficult to measure or calculate.\n", "\nBy owning a variety of company stocks across different industries, as well as by owning other types of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp\">securities</a>\u00a0in a variety of asset classes, such as Treasuries and municipal securities, investors will be less affected by single events.\n", "\nFor example, an investor, who owned nothing but airline stocks, would face a high level of unsystematic risk (also known as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/idiosyncraticrisk.asp\">idiosyncratic risk</a>). They would be vulnerable if airline industry employees went on strike, for example. This event could sink airline stock prices, even temporarily. Simply the anticipation of this news could hamper their portfolio.\n", "\nBy adding <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/correlation.asp\">uncorrelated</a> holdings to their portfolio, such as stocks outside of the transportation industry, this investor would spread out air-travel-specific concerns. Unsystematic risk, in this case, affects not only specific airlines but also several of the industries, such as large food companies, with which many airlines do business. In this regard, the investor could diversify away from public equities altogether by adding US Treasury Bonds as additional protection from fluctuations in stock prices.\n", "\nEven a portfolio of well-diversified assets cannot escape all risk, however. The portfolio will still be exposed to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/systematicrisk.asp\">systematic risk</a>, which refers to the uncertainty that faces the market as a whole\u00a0and includes shifts in interest rates, presidential elections, financial crises, wars, and natural disasters.\n", "\nUnsystematic risk is associated with a specific company or industry, which can often be controlled and mitigated with diversification. Key types of unsystematic risk are business or financial risk.\u00a0\n", "\nKey examples of unsystematic risk include management inefficiency, flawed business models, liquidity issues, or worker strikes.\u00a0\n", "\nSystematic risk is not diversifiable (i.e. cannot be avoided), while unsystematic can generally be avoided. Systematic risk affects much of the market and can include purchasing power or interest rate risk.\u00a0\n", "\nThere are five types of unsystematic risk\u2014business, financial, operational, strategic, and legal/regulatory risk.\n", "\nUnsystematic risk\u2014when it comes to investing in stocks\u2014can be considered the unsystematic variance. That is calculated by subtracting systematic variance from the total variance.\n", "\nUnsystematic risk is diversifiable, meaning that (in investing) if you buy shares of different companies across various industries you can reduce this risk. Unsystematic risks are often tied to a specific company or industry and can be avoided.\u00a0\n", "\nSystematic risk is a non-diversifiable risk or market risk. These factors are beyond the control of the business or investor, such as economic, political, or social factors. Meanwhile, microeconomic factors that affect companies are unsystematic risks.\n"]}
