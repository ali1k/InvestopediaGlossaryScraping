Generally, each ASIC miner is constructed to mine a specific digital currency. So, a <a class=\"CMY_Link CMY_Valid\" data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bitcoin.asp\">Bitcoin</a> ASIC miner can mine only bitcoin. Think of Bitcoin ASICs as specialized Bitcoin mining computers, or \u201cbitcoin generators.\u201d\n", "\nYou might also view ASIC devices as similar to the microprocessor and random access memory (RAM) chips in your computer; only instead of being <em>general </em>integrated circuits as those are, Bitcoin ASIC miners are <em>specific </em>integrated circuits designed solely to maintain the Bitcoin blockchain\u2014a public database that stores digital information. Developing and manufacturing ASICs as mining devices is costly and complex; but because ASICs are built especially for mining cryptocurrency, they do the job faster than less powerful computers.\n", "\nThere are many different brands of Bitcoin miners available, which can range in price from $20 to $5,000 depending on their power and complexity; and you may purchase Bitcoin ASIC miners in numerous places\u2014like Walmart (NYSE: WMT), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), and eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY). The Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Store even has an \"easy-to-use\" Bitcoin miner that you can download on your computer for free.\n", "\nWhen we say the words \u201cblock\u201d and \u201cchain\u201d in the context of blockchain, we are actually talking about digital information (the \u201cblock\u201d) that is stored in a public database (the \u201cchain\u201d). The Bitcoin protocol is built on the blockchain. So, with the launch of Bitcoin in 2009 as the first cryptocurrency, blockchain technology had its first real-world application.\n", "\nThere are no physical \"coins\" in bitcoin, only balances kept on a public ledger <a class=\"CMY_Link CMY_Valid\" data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cloud-storage.asp\">in the cloud</a>, that\u2014along with all bitcoin transactions\u2014is verified by a massive amount of computing power. Bitcoin is backed by millions of ASICs around the world called \u201cminers.\u201d By mining bitcoin, you can earn cryptocurrency without having to put down money for it. It is also the only way to release new bitcoin into circulation.\n", "\nAlthough investing in cryptocurrency is painstaking, costly, and only sporadically rewarding, some investors are drawn to it. People buy expensive ASICS and pay for lots of electricity so that they may earn more bitcoin, which may be exchanged for real-world currency.\n", "\nOriginally, Bitcoin\u2019s creator intended for bitcoin to be mined on central processing units (CPUs)\u2014your laptop or desktop computer. However, Bitcoin ASICs surpassed both CPUs and graphics processing units (GPUs) in terms of both their reduced electricity consumption and greater computing capacity. After gaining traction in mid-2013, when other hardware mining devices started hitting their bottlenecks in mining, Bitcoin ASIC miners have retained their lead.\n", "\nBitcoin miners perform complex calculations known as <a class=\"CMY_Link CMY_Valid\" data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hash.asp\">hashes</a>, and each hash has a chance of yielding bitcoin. The more hashes you perform, the more chances you have of earning bitcoin. Most people join a mining pool to increase their chances of earning bitcoin. Mining pools pay for high value hashes known as shares.\n", "\nThe default mining pool issues payouts weekly to accounts with at least 5000 Satoshis\u2014the smallest unit of the\u00a0Bitcoin\u00a0cryptocurrency. If an account doesn't reach 5000 Satoshis during a week, the balance carries forward (it is never lost).\n", "\nMining is the process of managing the blockchain. The job of ASIC Bitcoin miners is to review and verify previous bitcoin transactions and create a new block so the information can be added to the blockchain. The mining process involves solving complex mathematical problems using intrinsic\u00a0hash\u00a0functions linked to the\u00a0<a class=\"CMY_Link CMY_Valid\" data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/block-bitcoin-block.asp\">block</a>\u00a0that contains the transaction data. Various Bitcoin miners compete intensely with each other to solve a necessary mathematical puzzle.\n", "\nThe first miner to find the solution to the puzzle is able to authorize the transaction (to add bitcoin to the block). Each winner in the\u00a0Bitcoin-mining lottery receives a\u00a0reward (a certain amount of bitcoin). The\u00a0reward\u00a0includes all of the transaction fees for the transactions in that\u00a0block, which motivates miners to collect as many transactions into a\u00a0block\u00a0as possible to increase their\u00a0reward.\n"]}
