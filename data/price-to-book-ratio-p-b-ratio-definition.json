Traditionally, any value under 1.0 is considered a good P/B for value investors, indicating a potentially undervalued stock. However, value investors may often consider stocks with a P/B value under 3.0 as their benchmark.\n", "\nDue to accounting conventions on the treatment of certain costs, the market value of equity is typically higher than the book value of a company, resulting in a P/B ratio above 1. Under certain circumstances of financial distress, bankruptcy or expected plunges in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earnings-power.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">earnings power</a>, a company's P/B ratio can dive below a value of 1.\n", "\nBecause <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accounting-principles.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">accounting principles</a> do not recognize intangible assets such as the brand value, unless the company\u00a0derived them\u00a0through acquisitions, companies expense all costs associated with creating intangible assets\u00a0immediately.\n", "\nFor example, companies must expense\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/randd.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">research and most development</a>\u00a0costs,\u00a0reducing a company's book value. However, these R&amp;D outlays can create unique production processes for a company or result in new patents that can bring royalty revenues going forward. While accounting principles favor a conservative approach in capitalizing costs, market participants may raise the stock price because of such R&amp;D efforts, resulting in wide differences between the market and book values of equity.\n", "\nAssume that a company has $100 million in assets on the balance sheet and $75 million in liabilities. The book value of that company would be calculated simply as $25 million ($100M - $75M). If there are 10 million\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outstandingshares.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">shares outstanding</a>, each share would represent $2.50 of book value. If the share price is $5, then the P/B ratio would be 2x (5 / 2.50). This illustrates that the market price is valued at twice its book value.\n", "\nClosely related to the P/B ratio is the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/ptbv.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">price to tangible book value ratio</a> (PTBV). The latter is a valuation ratio expressing the price of a security compared to its hard, or tangible, book value as reported in the company's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancesheet.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">balance sheet</a>. The tangible book value number is equal to the company's total book value less than the value of any intangible assets.\n", "\nIntangible assets can be items such as patents, intellectual property, and goodwill. This may be a more useful measure of valuation when the market is valuing something like a patent in different ways or if it is difficult to put a value on such an intangible asset in the first place.\n", "\nInvestors find the P/B ratio useful because the book value of equity provides a relatively stable and intuitive metric\u00a0they can\u00a0easily compare\u00a0to the market price. The P/B ratio can also be used for firms with positive book values and negative earnings since negative earnings render price-to-earnings ratios useless, and there are fewer companies with negative book values than companies with negative earnings.\n", "\nHowever, when accounting standards applied by firms vary, P/B ratios may not be comparable, especially for companies from different countries. Additionally, P/B ratios can be less useful for service\u00a0and information technology companies with little <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tangibleasset.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tangible assets</a> on their <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancesheet.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">balance sheets</a>. Finally, the book value can become negative because of a long series of negative earnings, making the P/B ratio useless for relative <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valuation.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">valuation</a>.\n", "\nOther potential problems in using the P/B ratio stem from the fact that any number of scenarios, such as recent acquisitions, recent write-offs, or share\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/buyback.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">buybacks</a> can distort the book value figure in the equation. In searching for undervalued stocks, investors should consider multiple valuation measures to complement the P/B ratio.\n", "\nThe price-to-book ratio is one of the most widely-used financial ratios. It compares a company\u2019s market price to its book value, essentially showing the value given by the market for each dollar of the company\u2019s net worth. High-growth companies will often show price-to-book ratios well above 1.0, whereas companies facing severe distress will occasionally show ratios below 1.0.\n", "\nThe price-to-book ratio is important because it can help investors understand whether the market price of a company seems reasonable when compared to its balance sheet. For example, if a company shows a high price-to-book ratio, investors might check to see whether that valuation is justified given other measures, such as its historical return on assets or growth in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eps.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">earnings per share (EPS)</a>. Price-to-book ratio is also frequently used to screen potential investment opportunities.\n", "\nWhat counts as a \u201cgood\u201d price-to-book ratio will depend on the industry in question and the overall state of valuations in the market. For example, between 2010 and 2020 there was a steady rise in the average price-to-book ratio of the technology companies listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange, roughly tripling during that period. An investor assessing the price-to-book ratio of one of these technology companies might therefore choose to accept a higher average price-to-book ratio, as compared to an investor looking at a company in a more traditional industry in which lower price-to-book ratios are the norm.\n"]}
