The mortgage interest deduction can also be taken on loans for second homes and vacation residences with certain limitations. The amount of deductible mortgage interest is reported each year by the mortgage company on Form 1098. This deduction is offered as an incentive for homeowners.\n", "\nHome mortgage interest is reported on <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/schedulea.asp\">Schedule A </a>of the 1040 tax form. Mortgage interest paid on rental properties is also deductible, but this is reported on Schedule E.
