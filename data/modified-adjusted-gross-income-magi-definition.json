First of all, it determines whether you can contribute to a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rothira.asp\">Roth IRA</a> and if you can deduct IRA contributions.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\"></span><span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"15\"></span> It also factors into your eligibility for certain education tax benefits and income tax credits.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"14\"></span> Furthermore, it establishes your eligibility for income-based <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/medicaid.asp\">Medicaid</a> and subsidized health insurance plans on the\u00a0Health Insurance Marketplace.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"13\"></span>\n", "\nStill, as important as this number is, you won\u2019t find it on your tax return.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"22\"></span> You\u2019ll have to crunch some numbers to find your MAGI.\n", "\nMAGI can be defined as your household\u2019s adjusted gross income with any tax-exempt interest income and certain deductions added back.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"22\"></span> The <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irs.asp\">Internal Revenue Service</a> (IRS) uses MAGI to establish if you qualify for certain tax benefits.

The second is if your divorce agreement was executed before 2019 but later modified to expressly state that such payments are not deductible for the payer.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"8\"></span>\n", "\nYour adjusted gross income (AGI) is important because it\u2019s the total taxable income calculated before itemized or standard deductions, exemptions, and credits are taken into account.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"18\"></span> It dictates how you can use various tax credits and exemptions. For example, AGI affects the amount of money you can claim for the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/childtaxcredit.asp\">child tax credit</a>.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"10\"></span>\n", "\nYour adjusted gross income is equal to your gross income, less certain tax-deductible expenses, including:\n", "\nTo find your MAGI, take your AGI and add back:\n", "\nTo contribute to a Roth IRA,\u00a0your MAGI must be below the limits\u00a0specified by the IRS.

If neither spouse is covered by a plan at work, you can take the full deduction, up to the amount of your contribution limit.

If you need help figuring out your MAGI, or if you have any questions about IRA contribution and income limits, contact a trusted tax professional.\n", "\nCalculating your MAGI is relatively straightforward. To do so, first calculate your adjusted gross income (AGI) and then add back any of the deductions specified by the IRS that apply to your situation. Examples of these deductions include income from foreign sources, interest from certain savings bonds, and expenses related to adopting a child. Because MAGI involves adding back these deductions, MAGI will always be greater than or equal to AGI.\n", "\nMAGI is used by the IRS to determine whether you qualify for certain tax programs and benefits. For instance, it helps determine the size of your Roth IRA contributions. Knowing your MAGI can also help avoid facing tax penalties, since over-contributing to these programs and others like them can trigger interest payments and fines. Your MAGI can also determine eligibility for certain government programs, such as the subsidized insurance plans available on the Health Insurance Marketplace.\u00a0\n", "\nYes, MAGI and AGI can be the same. For many people, the list of deductions that need to be added back to AGI in order to calculate MAGI will not be relevant. For instance, those who did not earn any foreign income would have no reason to use that deduction and would not add back those earnings to their AGI. For them, AGI and MAGI would therefore be the same number.\n"]}
