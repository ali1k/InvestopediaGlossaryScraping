The employer may be able to avoid vicarious liability by exercising reasonable care to prevent the unlawful behavior.\n", "\nAnother common source of vicarious liability occurs when a child behaves negligently. The parent can sometimes be held vicariously liable for the child's actions. One situation wherein this might occur is if a child injures or kills someone while driving.
