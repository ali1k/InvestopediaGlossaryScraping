Tax incidence can also be related to the price elasticity of supply and demand.\u00a0When supply is more elastic than demand, the tax burden falls on the buyers. If demand is more elastic than supply, producers will bear the cost of the tax.\n", "\nThe tax incidence depicts the distribution of the tax obligations, which must be covered by the buyer and seller. The level at which each party participates in covering the obligation shifts based on the associated price elasticity of the product or service in question as well as how the product or service is currently affected by the principles of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/law-of-supply-demand.asp\">supply and demand</a>.\n", "\nTax incidence reveals which group\u2014consumers or producers\u2014will pay the price of a new tax. For example, the demand for prescription drugs is relatively\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/inelastic.asp\">inelastic</a>. Despite changes in cost, its market will remain relatively constant.\n", "\nAnother example is that the demand for cigarettes is mostly inelastic.\u00a0When governments impose a cigarette tax, producers increase the sale price by the full amount of the tax, transferring the tax burden to consumers. Through analysis, it\u00a0is found\u00a0the demand for cigarettes is unaffected by price.\u00a0Of course, there are limits to this theory.\u00a0If a pack of cigarettes suddenly increased from $5 to $1,000, consumer demand would fall.\n", "\nIf the levying\u00a0of new taxes on an elastic good,\u00a0such as fine jewelry, occurs, most\u00a0of the burden would likely shift to the producer as an increase in price may have a significant impact on the demand for the associated goods.\u00a0Elastic goods are goods with close substitutes or that are nonessential.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/priceelasticity.asp\">Price elasticity</a>\u00a0is a representation of how buyer activity changes in response to movements\u00a0in the price of a good or service. In situations where the buyer is likely to continue purchasing a good or service regardless of a price change, the demand is said to be inelastic. When the price of the good or service\u00a0profoundly impacts the level of demand, the demand is considered highly elastic.\n", "\nExamples of inelastic goods or services can include gasoline and prescription medicines. The level of consumption across the economy remains steady with price changes. Elastic products are those whose demand is significantly affected by price. This\u00a0group of products includes luxury goods, houses, and clothing.\n", "\nThe formula for determining the consumer's tax burden\u00a0with \"E\" representing elasticity\u00a0is as follows:\n", "\nThe formula for determining the producer or\u00a0supplier's tax burden\u00a0with \"E\" representing elasticity\u00a0is as follows:\n"]}
