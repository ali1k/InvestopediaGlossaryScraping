Investors can find Morningstar\u2019s sustainability ratings on the right-hand side of morningstar.com\u2019s <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"http://www.morningstar.com/\">fund quote pages</a>. The Morningstar Portfolio Sustainability Ratings are issued monthly.\n", "\nMorningstar\u2019s development of this rating system reflects the dramatic increase and importance of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sustainability.asp\">sustainable</a> investing. The sustainability ratings are based on two components: company-level ESG scores developed by Sustainalytics and ESG controversies. Each fund\u2019s ESG score is based on its underlying companies\u2019 preparedness, disclosure, and performance. Each company in the portfolio is graded on a scale of 0 to 100 relative to other firms in its global industry peer group. As a result, two companies that have\u00a0the same score but belong\u00a0to different peer groups may not have equivalent levels of environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) performance. A score of 50 means that the company is considered average relative to its peer group; a score of 70 or higher means that the company is rated\u00a0at least two standard deviations above average in its peer group. A\u00a0score of 30 or lower means that the company scores at least two standard deviations below average in its peer group.\n", "\nAt least half of a portfolio\u2019s <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aum.asp\">assets under management</a> (AUM) must have a company ESG score for the portfolio to obtain\u00a0a sustainability score. The Morningstar Sustainability Rating then takes the portfolio\u2019s score and subtracts points for controversial ESG-related issues that companies in the portfolio may have. Controversies include incidents that impact the environment and society, such as oil spills,\u00a0discrimination lawsuits\u00a0or events that affect the company.\n", "\nAccording to Morningstar, funds with higher sustainability ratings tend to have higher-quality holdings. By higher quality, Morningstar is referring to\u00a0funds with five-globe sustainability ratings that\u00a0more likely to have high star ratings for their <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskadjustedreturn.asp\">risk-adjusted returns</a>,\u00a0are more likely to be favored by Morningstar analysts,\u00a0are less volatile,\u00a0and have more exposure to financially healthy companies with <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economicmoat.asp\">economic moats</a>.\n", "\nHowever, a fund may have a high star rating and a low sustainability rating. For example, Fidelity\u2019s Total Market Index Premium fund (FSTVX),\u00a0has a four-star Morningstar rating out of five\u00a0for its risk-adjusted returns. Morningstar\u2019s premium analyst report calls this fund \u201ca great choice for diversified exposure to U.S. stocks of all sizes\u201d thanks to its low cost (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/no-loadfund.asp\">no load</a> and an expense ratio of 0.05%, well below the group median of 0.90%) and its \u201cbroad, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalizationweightedindex.asp\">market-cap-weighted</a> coverage of the U.S. market.\u201d It also carries a gold rating, indicating that analysts expect the fund to outperform over a full market cycle of at least five years. However, it only has a sustainability rating of two\u00a0globes out of five\u00a0(below average) based on an 80%\u00a0ranking in its category and a sustainability score of 45.\n", "\nMorningstar\u2019s Sustainability Ratings make it possible for investors to tilt their portfolios toward\u00a0a sustainable investment philosophy without having to purchase sustainable, responsible\u00a0and impact (SRI, formerly <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sri.asp\">socially responsible investing</a>) funds. SRI funds have several potential shortcomings: they represent a small percentage of the fund universe (about 2%, according to Morningstar estimates) and studies have both proven and disproven their ability to offer higher returns compared to\u00a0their non-SRI counterparts. As a result, many investors are hesitant to invest in SRI funds. In addition, investing in SRI funds can lead to overexposure in\u00a0some sectors and underexposure in others.\n", "\nInvestors may be more inclined to choose one traditional fund over another based on the relative Morningstar Sustainability Ratings. If an investor is choosing between two large-cap <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/growthfund.asp\">growth funds</a> with similar long-term performance and investment strategies, and one has a two-globe rating and the other a four-globe rating, the globe rating may be the deciding factor.\n"]}
