Each portion or tranche of a securitized or structured product is one of several related securities offered at the same time, but with varying risks, rewards and maturities\u00a0to appeal to a diverse range of investors.\n", "\nTranche is a French word meaning <em>slice</em> or <em>portion</em>.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff They are commonly found in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mbs.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mortgage-backed securities (MBS)</a> or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset-backedsecurity.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">asset-backed securities (ABS)</a>.\n", "\nTranches in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/structuredfinance.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">structured finance</a> are a fairly recent development, spurred by the increased use of\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/securitization.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">securitization</a>\u00a0to divide up sometimes-risky financial products with steady cash flows to then sell these divisions to other investors. The word <em>tranche</em> comes from the French word for slice.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff The discrete tranches of a larger asset pool are usually defined in transaction documentation and assigned different classes of notes,\u00a0each with a different bond credit rating.\n", "\nSenior tranches typically contain assets with higher credit ratings than junior tranches. The senior tranches have first lien on the assets\u2014they're in line to be repaid first, in case of default. Junior tranches have a second lien or no lien at all.\n", "\nExamples of financial products that can be divided into tranches include bonds, loans, insurance policies, mortgages and other debts.\n", "\nA tranche is a common financial structure for securitized debt products, such as a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cdo.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">collateralized debt obligation (CDO)</a>, which pools together a collection of cash flow-generating assets\u2014such as mortgages, bonds, and loans\u2014or a mortgage-backed security. An MBS is made of multiple mortgage pools that have a wide variety of loans, from safe loans with lower interest rates to risky loans with higher rates. Each specific mortgage pool has its own time to maturity, which factors into the risk and reward benefits. Therefore, tranches are made to divide up the different mortgage profiles into slices that have financial terms suitable for specific investors.\n", "\nFor example, a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cmo.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO)</a> offering a partitioned mortgage-backed securities portfolio might have mortgage tranches with one-year, two-year, five-year and 20-year maturities, all with varying yields. If an investor wants to buy a MBS, they can choose the tranche type most applicable to their appetite for return and aversion to risk.

They can either try to sell it and make a quick profit or hold onto it and realize small but long-term gains in the form of interest payments. These monthly payments are bits and pieces of all the interest payments made by homeowners whose mortgage is included in a specific MBS.\n", "\nInvestors who desire to have long-term steady cash flow will invest in tranches with a longer time to maturity. Investors who need a more immediate but a more lucrative income stream will invest in tranches with less time to maturity.\u00a0\n", "\nAll tranches, regardless of interest and maturity, allow investors to customize <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investmentstrategy.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">investment strategies</a> to their specific needs.

If they are given a higher rating than deserved, it can cause investors to be exposed to riskier assets than they intended to be. Such mislabeling played a part in the mortgage meltdown of 2007 and subsequent financial crisis. Tranches containing junk bonds or sub-prime mortgages (below-investment-grade assets) were labeled AAA or the equivalent, either through incompetence, carelessness or, as some charged, outright corruption on the agencies' part.\n", "\nAfter the financial crisis of 2007-09, an explosion of lawsuits occurred against issuers of CMOs, CDOs and other debt securities\u2014and among investors in the products themselves, all of which was dubbed \"tranche warfare\" in the press.

CDO trustees, such as Deutsche Bank and Wells Fargo, filed suits to ensure all tranche investors continued to receive funds.\n", "\nAnd in 2009, the manager of Greenwich, Conn.-based hedge fund Carrington Investment Partners <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www.housingwire.com/articles/tranche-warfare-mbs-investor-sues-american-home-over-reo-sales\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">filed a lawsuit </a>against the mortgage-servicing company American Home Mortgage Servicing. The hedge fund held junior tranches of mortgage-backed securities that contained loans made on foreclosed properties that American Home was selling for (allegedly) low prices\u2014thus crippling the tranche's yield. Carrington argued in the complaint that its interests as a junior tranche-holder were in line with those of the senior tranche-holders.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n"]}
