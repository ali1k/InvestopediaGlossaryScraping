Net foreign assets (NFA) refer to the value of overseas <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp\">assets</a> owned by a nation, minus the value of its domestic assets that are owned by foreigners, adjusted for changes in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valuation.asp\">valuation</a> and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exchangerate.asp\">exchange rates</a>.\n", "\nA nation's net foreign assets (NFA) position is also defined as the cumulative change in its <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentaccount.asp\">current account</a>, which is the sum of the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bot.asp\">balance of trade</a>, net income over time, and net <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/current-transfers.asp\">current transfers</a>\u00a0over time. The net foreign assets position indicates whether the nation is a net creditor or debtor\u00a0to the rest of the world. A positive NFA balance means that it is a net lender,\u00a0while a negative NFA balance shows that it is a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/net-borrower.asp\">net borrower</a>.\n", "\nAn alternative definition of \u201cNet Foreign Assets\u201d from <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/worldbank.asp\">the World Bank</a> is that it is the sum of foreign assets held by monetary authorities and deposit money banks, less their foreign <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liability.asp\">liabilities</a>.\n", "\nRelating a nation\u2019s NFA position to its cumulative change in its current account is conceptually easy to understand, since an entity\u2019s debt position at any point in time is the sum total of its past borrowing and lending activity. If an entity\u2019s borrowings total $500, but it has loaned out $1,500, it is a net creditor in the amount of $1,000.\n", "\nLikewise, if a nation runs a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentaccountdeficit.asp\">current account deficit</a> of say $10 billion, it has to borrow that amount from foreign sources to finance the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortfall.asp\">shortfall</a>. In this case, borrowing $10 billion would increase its foreign liability and reduce its net foreign asset position by that amount.\n", "\nIn addition to the current account position, valuation and exchange rate changes should be taken into account to get a true picture of the NFA position. For example, foreign governments hold trillions of dollars in U.S. government bonds. If interest rates rise and U.S. government bonds decline in price, this would have the effect of reducing the overall value of these nation's U.S. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/government-bond.asp\">government bond</a> holdings, and therefore of their net foreign assets.\n", "\nExchange rate fluctuations can also have a significant effect on the NFA position. Appreciation of a nation\u2019s currency against that of other nations will\u00a0decrease the value of both foreign-currency denominated assets and liabilities, while <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/depreciation.asp\">depreciation</a> will increase the value of these overseas assets and liabilities. Thus, if the nation is a net debtor, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currency-depreciation.asp\">currency depreciation</a> will increase its foreign-currency debt burden.\n", "\nThe NFA position itself can drive changes in exchange rates, since chronic current account <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deficit.asp\">deficits</a> can prove unsustainable over time. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currency.asp\">Currencies</a> of nations with a significantly negative NFA position and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/current-account-deficit/\">growing current account deficits</a> can come under attack from currency <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/speculator.asp\">speculators</a> who may seek to drive it lower.\n"]}
