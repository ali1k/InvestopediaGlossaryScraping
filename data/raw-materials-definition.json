Raw materials are commodities that are bought and sold on\u00a0commodities exchanges\u00a0worldwide. Traders buy and sell raw materials in what is called the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/factor-market.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">factor market</a>\u00a0because raw materials are\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/factors-production.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">factors of production</a>\u00a0as are\u00a0labor and capital.\n", "\nRaw materials are used in a multitude of products. They can take many different forms. The kind of raw materials inventory a company needs will depend on the type of manufacturing they do. For manufacturing companies, raw materials inventory requires detailed budgeting and a special framework for accounting on the balance sheet and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/031815/what-formula-calculating-profit-margins.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">income</a> statement.\n", "\nManufacturing companies take special steps to account for raw materials inventory. This includes three distinct inventory classifications on their <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancesheet.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">balance sheet</a>\u00a0compared to just one for non-manufacturers.\u00a0The current assets portion of the balance sheet for manufacturing companies will include:\n", "\nAll inventory, including raw materials inventory, should be valued at its comprehensive cost. This means its value includes shipping, storage, and preparation. The typical journal entries in an accrual accounting system for the initial purchases of raw materials inventory include a credit to cash and a debit to inventory. Debiting inventory increases current assets and crediting cash will reduce cash assets by the inventory amount.\n", "\nWhen a company uses raw materials inventory in production, it transfers them from the raw materials inventory to the\u00a0work-in-process inventory. When a company completes its\u00a0work-in-process items, it adds the finished items to the finished goods\u00a0inventory, making them ready for sale.\n", "\nIn some cases, raw materials may be divided into two categories: direct and indirect. Whether a raw material is direct or indirect will influence where it is reported on the balance sheet and how it is expensed on the income statement.\n", "\nDirect raw materials are materials that companies directly use\u00a0in the manufacturing of a finished product, such as wood for a chair.\u00a0Indirect raw materials are not part of the final product\u00a0but are\u00a0instead used comprehensively in the production process.\n", "\nIndirect raw materials will be recorded as long-term assets. Within long-term assets, they can fall under several different categories including selling, general, and administrative or property, plant, and equipment. Long-term assets usually follow some depreciation schedule which allows the assets to be expensed over time and matched with revenue they help to produce. For indirect raw materials, depreciation timing will usually be shorter than other long-term assets like a building expensed over several years.\n", "\nDirect raw materials are placed in current assets as discussed above. Direct raw materials are expensed on the income statement within cost of goods sold. Manufacturing companies must also take added steps over non-manufacturing companies to create more detailed expense reporting on costs of goods sold. Direct raw materials are typically considered\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lowerofcostandmarketmethod.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">variable costs</a>\u00a0since the amount used depends on the quantities being produced.\n", "\nA manufacturer\u00a0calculates the amount of direct raw materials it needs\u00a0for specific periods\u00a0to ensure\u00a0there are no shortages. By closely tracking the amount of direct raw materials bought and used, an entity can reduce unnecessary inventory stock, potentially lower ordering costs,\u00a0and reduce the risk of material obsolescence.\n", "\nRaw materials may degrade in storage\u00a0or\u00a0become unusable in a product for various reasons. In this case, the company declares them obsolete. If this occurs, the company expenses the inventory as a debit to write-offs and credits the obsolete inventory to decrease assets.\n", "\nAfrica, the Middle East, and China are thought to have the world's largest supplies of natural resources. According to\u00a0World Bank data, the Congo Republic, South Sudan, Libya, and Iraq round out the world\u2019s top natural resource producers by percentage of gross domestic product (GDP). The top producers as of 2018 by GDP include the following:\n", "\nThe World Bank calculates these percentages using natural resource rent. Natural resource rent is the revenue remaining after the deduction of the cost to access resources.\n"]}
