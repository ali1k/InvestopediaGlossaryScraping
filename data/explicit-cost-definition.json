Explicit costs have clearly defined dollar amounts, which flow through to the income statement. Examples of explicit costs include wages, lease payments, utilities, raw materials, and other direct costs.\n", "\nExplicit costs\u2014also known as accounting costs\u2014are easy to identify and link to a company's business activities to which the expenses are attributed. They are recorded in a company's general ledger and flow through to the expenses listed on the <a class=\"CMY_Link CMY_Valid\" data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incomestatement.asp\">income statement</a>. The net income (NI)\u00a0of a business reflects the\u00a0residual income\u00a0that remains after all explicit costs have been paid. Explicit costs are the only accounting costs that are necessary to calculate a profit, as they have a clear impact on a company's bottom line. The explicit-cost metric is especially helpful for companies' long-term strategic planning.\n", "\nExplicit costs, involve <a class=\"CMY_Link CMY_Valid\" data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tangibleasset.asp\">tangible assets</a> and monetary transactions and result in real business opportunities. Explicit costs are easy to identify, record, and audit because of their paper trail. Expenses relating to advertising, supplies, utilities, inventory, and purchased equipment are examples of explicit costs. Although the depreciation of an asset is not an activity that can be tangibly traced, depreciation expense is an explicit cost because it relates to the cost of the underlying asset owned by the company.\n", "\nIn contrast, <a class=\"CMY_Link CMY_Valid\" data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/implicitcost.asp\">implicit</a> or implied costs are not clearly defined, identified, or reported as expenses.\u00a0They often deal with intangibles and are described as opportunity costs\u2014the value of the best alternative not accepted.\u00a0An example of an implicit cost is time spent on one activity of a business that could better be spent on a different pursuit.\u00a0Management will utilize explicit costs when reviewing a business's operations, including profits; but will calculate implicit costs only for decisionmaking or choosing between multiple alternatives.\n", "\nCompanies use both explicit and implicit costs when calculating a company's economic profit\u2014defined as the total return a company receives based on all costs incurred to attain that revenue. Specifically, economic profit is used extensively to determine whether a business should enter or exit a market or industry.\n"]}
