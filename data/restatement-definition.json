Restatements are necessary when it is determined that a previous statement contained a \"material\" inaccuracy. This can result from accounting mistakes, noncompliance with <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gaap.asp\">generally accepted accounting principles</a> (GAAP), fraud, misrepresentation, or a simple clerical error.\u00a0\n", "\nCompany management and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/independentauditor.asp\">independent auditors</a> are responsible for ensuring that quarterly and annual financial statements accurately reflect the financial condition of a firm. Sometimes, previous statements need to be amended. At times, these mistakes will be spotted by internal auditors. On other occasions, it might be a third-party, such as the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp\">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC), that spots them.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fasb.asp\">The Financial Accounting Standards Board</a> (FASB) requires companies to issue a restatement to correct previous errors. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accountant-responsibility.asp\">Accountants</a> are responsible for deciding whether a past error is \u201cmaterial\u201d enough to warrant a restatement.\n", "\nMaterial is a loose term that is not accompanied by specific percentage guidelines and so forth. As a general rule of thumb, an error can be considered material if the incorrect information would lead those receiving the statements to come to inaccurate conclusions as part of a standard analysis.\n", "\nIf an issue or error is found that affects part of a financial document or the document as a whole, it is likely that a restatement will be required. Additionally, if certain key information pertaining to the original statement is received after the first statement was released, a restatement may be issued to adjust the financials based on the new discoveries.\n", "\nMany restatements are the result of innocent mistakes and basic misinterpretation. However, some can raise red flags, highlighting potential <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fraud.asp\">fraud</a> or incompetence. Over-reporting a company\u2019s gains can be very misleading. It can lead investors to believe the company is in a stronger financial position than is actually the case. Based on the inaccurate information, investors may perform actions, in regards to the previously made investments, that otherwise would not have been made.\n", "\nNegative restatements are regularly frowned on, shaking investor confidence and causing share prices to decline.

How much of an impact is it likely to have and, more importantly, was it an innocent mistake, or something that appears to be more sinister? Look for indications from management on how it plans to stop similar mistakes from happening in the future.\n", "\nIt is also worth remembering that changes in certain financial estimates are not required, as these are based on anticipated events and not ones that have already occurred. These changes must only be reported on the next financial statement after the change is made and are not applied retroactively.\n"]}
