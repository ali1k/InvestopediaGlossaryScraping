The current account includes transactions in goods, services, investment income,\u00a0and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/current-transfers.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">current transfers</a>.\u00a0The capital account, broadly defined,\u00a0includes transactions in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financialinstrument.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">financial instruments</a>\u00a0and central bank\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"5\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/international-reserves.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reserves</a>. Narrowly defined, it includes only transactions in financial instruments. The current account is included\u00a0in calculations of national output, while the capital account is not.\u00a0\n", "\nThe sum of all transactions recorded in the balance of payments must be zero, as long as the capital account is defined broadly. The reason\u00a0is that\u00a0every credit appearing\u00a0in the current account has a corresponding debit in the capital account, and vice-versa. If a country exports an item (a current account transaction), it effectively imports foreign capital when that item is paid for (a capital account transaction).\n", "\nIf a country cannot fund its imports through exports of capital, it must do so by running down its reserves.\u00a0This situation is often referred to as a\u00a0balance of payments deficit, using the narrow\u00a0definition of the capital account that excludes\u00a0central bank reserves. In reality, however, the broadly defined balance of payments must add up to zero <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/double-entry.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">by definition</a>. In practice, statistical discrepancies arise due to the difficulty of accurately counting every transaction between an economy and the rest of the world, including discrepancies caused by foreign currency translations.\u00a0\n", "\nBalance of payments and international investment position data are critical in formulating national and international economic policy. Certain aspects of the balance of payments data, such as payment imbalances and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fdi.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">foreign direct investment</a>, are key issues that a nation's policymakers\u00a0seek to address.\n", "\nEconomic policies are often targeted at specific objectives that, in turn, impact the balance of payments. For example, one\u00a0country might adopt policies specifically designed to attract foreign investment\u00a0in a particular sector, while another\u00a0might attempt to keep its currency at an artificially low level in order to stimulate exports\u00a0and build up its currency reserves. The impact of these policies is ultimately captured in the balance of payments data.\n", "\nWhile a nation's balance of payments necessarily zeroes out\u00a0the current and capital accounts, imbalances can and do appear between different countries' current accounts. According to the World Bank, the U.S. had the world's largest <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentaccountdeficit.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">current account deficit</a> in 2019, at $498 billion. Germany had the world's largest surplus, at $275 billion.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nSuch imbalances can generate tensions between countries. Donald Trump campaigned in 2016 on a platform of reversing the U.S.'s trade deficits, particularly with Mexico and China.

Growth was low, so stimulating a trade surplus was the primary method of strengthening a nation's financial position. National economies were not well integrated with each other, however, so steep trade imbalances rarely provoked crises. The industrial revolution increased international economic integration, and balance of payment crises began to occur more frequently.\u00a0\n", "\nThe Great Depression led countries to abandon the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/09/gold-standard.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">gold standard</a> and engage in competitive devaluation of their currencies, but the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/122215/bretton-woods-system-how-it-changed-world.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bretton Woods system</a> that prevailed from the end of World War II until the 1970s introduced a gold-convertible dollar with fixed exchange rates to other currencies.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff As the U.S. money supply increased and its trade deficit deepened, however, the government became unable to fully redeem foreign central banks' dollar reserves for gold, and the system was abandoned.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff\n", "\nSince the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nixon-shock.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nixon shock</a>\u2014as the end of the dollar's convertibility to gold is known\u2014currencies have floated freely, meaning that country experiencing a trade deficit can artificially depress its currency\u2014by hoarding foreign reserves, for example\u2014making its products more attractive and increasing its exports.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"6\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff Due to the increased mobility of capital across borders, balance of payments crises sometimes occur, causing sharp currency devaluations such as the ones that\u00a0struck\u00a0in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asian-financial-crisis.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Southeast Asian countries</a> in 1998.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"5\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nDuring the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/great-recession.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Great Recession</a> several countries embarked on competitive devaluation of their currencies to try to boost their exports.
