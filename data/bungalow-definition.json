Bungalows are generally small in terms of square footage, but it is not uncommon to see very large bungalows. Bungalows were originally designed to provide affordable, modern housing for the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/working-class.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">working class</a>.\n", "\nBungalows\u00a0are most often one-story houses, although they often also include an additional\u00a0half story, usually with a sloped roof. There are various types of\u00a0bungalows, including raised\u00a0bungalows\u00a0that have basements partially above ground to let in additional sunlight. There are also\u00a0some bungalows that branch away from the original definition by adding additional levels such as lofts and half levels. Common features of the\u00a0bungalow\u00a0include a dormer window and a veranda.\n", "\nBungalows are small and easy to maintain and are therefore great homes for the elderly or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/disability-insurance.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">people with disabilities</a>.\u00a0They\u00a0are also cost-efficient; heating and cooling costs tend to be lower, and the property value tends to remain relatively high. Because bungalows\u00a0occupy more square footage than multi-story homes, they tend to allow more space for modifications and additions. They also afford more privacy than most traditional homes, as they're low to the ground and the windows can easily be blocked by trees, shrubs, and fences.\u00a0\n", "\nOn the other hand,\u00a0bungalows\u00a0tend to occupy a larger area of land than their multi-story counterparts;\u00a0since they don't extend upwards, they take up more square footage on the first floor. This means that the initial costs are higher since\u00a0they cost more per square foot, and they also require more material for roofing.\u00a0\n", "\nBungalows\u00a0also tend to have smaller and fewer rooms extending off a larger living room, as opposed to large bedrooms or an open floor plan. Also, because they're low to the ground, they're more susceptible to break-ins; therefore, it's a good idea to invest in a home security system if you purchase a\u00a0bungalow.\n", "\nBungalows\u00a0were first built in the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/022316/south-asia-new-face-emerging-economies.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">South Asian</a> region of Bengal.\u00a0Bungalows, which derive their name from Hindi, were first identified as such by British sailors of the East India Company in the late\u00a017th\u00a0century. As time progressed, a bungalow came to refer to a large dwelling, often representing <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/status-symbol.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">high social status</a>\u00a0in both Britain and America.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nThe term\u00a0bungalow\u00a0as we now know it \u2013\u00a0a small dwelling, typically one story \u2013\u00a0developed in the\u00a020th\u00a0century, although its definition varies in different areas of the world. For example, in India today, the term generally refers to any single-family dwelling, regardless of how many stories it has.\n", "\nIn Canada and the United Kingdom, a\u00a0bungalow\u00a0almost exclusively refers to one-story units. Australia tends toward the California\u00a0bungalow, a type of\u00a0bungalow\u00a0that was popular in the United States from about 1910 to 1940 and expanded abroad\u00a0as Hollywood became popular and increased the desirability of American-made products.\n", "\nThe California\u00a0bungalow\u00a0is one to one-and-a-half stories and features a large porch, sloping roof, and Spanish-inspired details. Other types of now-popular bungalow styles include the Chicago bungalow, which has Chicago roots circa\u00a0the 1920s and is typically made of brick, and the chalet bungalow, which deviates from the one-story norm\u00a0by having a second-story loft.\n"]}
