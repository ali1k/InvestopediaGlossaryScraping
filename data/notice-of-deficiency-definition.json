It is an official written claim that a taxpayer owes additional income tax (and often interest on that amount, plus additional penalties). It is issued when the IRS proposes a change to a tax return because they found that the information reported on a return does not match their records. A notice of deficiency is also sometimes referred to as a statutory notice, a statutory notice of deficiency, or an IRS 90-day letter. The official name for a notice of deficiency is IRS Notice CP2319A: Notice of Deficiency and Increase in Tax.\n", "\nTax laws require that the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irs.asp\">Internal Revenue Service (IRS)</a> issues a notice of deficiency before assessing additional income tax, estate tax, gift tax, and certain excise taxes (unless the taxpayer agrees to the additional assessment). Although\u00a0the language in the notice of deficiency says that the IRS is <em>proposing</em> a change, the notice of deficiency is a legal determination of tax <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deficiency.asp\">deficiency</a> that is presumptively correct.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nA notice of deficiency is usually triggered by tax information received from a third party filer\u2013such as an employer or a financial institution\u2013that does not match the information reported by the taxpayer.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff A notice of deficiency is triggered by a taxpayer\u2019s failure to timely respond to, or to successfully\u00a0appeal, a pre-assessment letter known as a 30-day letter.\u00a0<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nWhen an examination results in a proposed tax deficiency, the first step the IRS takes towards amending this deficiency is to issue a 30-day letter to the taxpayer.

The 90-day period within which a petition may be filed is prescribed by statute and cannot be extended.\u00a0The 90-day period is counted from the date the notice of deficiency is mailed to the taxpayer\u2019s last known address.
