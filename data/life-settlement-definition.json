Payment is more than the surrender value but less than the actual death benefit. After the sale, the purchaser becomes the policy's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beneficiary.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">beneficiary</a> and assumes payment of its premiums. By doing so, they receive the death benefit when the insured dies.\n", "\nWhen an insured party can no longer afford their insurance policy, they can sell it for a certain amount of cash to an investor\u2014usually an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/institutionalinvestor.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">institutional investor</a>. The cash payment is primarily tax-free for most policy owners. The insured person essentially transfers ownership of the policy to the investor. As we noted above, the insured party receives a cash <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/payment.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">payment</a> in exchange for the policy\u2014more than the surrender value, but less than the policy's prescribed payout at death.\n", "\nBy selling it, the insured person transfers every aspect of the policy to the new owner. This means the investor who takes over the policy inherits and becomes responsible for everything related to the policy including <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/premium.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">premium</a> payments along with the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deathbenefit.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">death benefit</a>. So, once the insured party dies, the new owner\u2014who becomes the beneficiary after the transfer\u2014receives the payout.\n", "\nThere are many reasons why people choose to sell their life insurance policies and are usually only done when the insured person doesn't have a known life-threatening illness. The majority of people who sell their policies for a life settlement tend to be older people\u2014those who need money for <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/retirement.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">retirement</a> but haven't been able to save up enough. That's why life settlements are often called senior settlements. By receiving a cash payout, the insured party can supplement their retirement income with a largely <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tax-free.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tax-free</a> payout.\n", "\nOther reasons for choosing a life settlement include:\n", "\nLife settlements effectively create a secondary market for <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stranger-owned-life-insurance-stoli.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">life insurance</a> policies. This secondary market has been years in the making. There have been a number of judicial rulings that have legitimized the market\u2014one of the most notable being the<strong>\u00a0</strong>1911<strong> </strong>U.S. Supreme Court\u00a0case of Grigsby v. Russell.\n", "\nJohn Burchard wasn't able to keep up the premium payments on his life insurance policy and sold it to his doctor, A. H. Grigsby. When Burchard died, Grigsby tried to collect the death benefit. The executor of Burchard's estate sued Grigsby to get the money and won. But the case ended up in the Supreme Court. In his ruling, Supreme Court Justice\u00a0Oliver Wendell Holmes\u00a0likened life insurance to regular <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/property.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">property</a>. He believed the policy could be transferred by the owner at will and had the same legal standing as other types of property like stocks and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bonds</a>. In addition, he said there are rights that come with life insurance as a piece of property:\n", "\nPolicy sales became popular during the 1980s when people living with AIDS had life insurance they didn't need. This led to another part of the industry\u2014the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/viaticalsettlement.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">viatical settlement</a> industry, where people who have terminal illnesses sell their policies for cash. This part of the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/industry.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">industry</a> lost its luster after people with AIDS began living longer.\n", "\nWhen someone becomes terminally ill and has a very short life span, they may sell their life insurance to someone else. In exchange for a large <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lump-sum-payment.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lump sum</a> of money, the buyer takes on the premium payments, becoming the policy's new owner. After the insured party dies, the new owner receives the death benefit.\n", "\nViatical settlements are generally riskier because the investor basically <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/speculation.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">speculates</a> on the death of the insured. Even though the original policy owner may be ill, there's no way of knowing when they will actually die. If the insured person lives longer, the policy becomes cheaper, but the actual <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/return.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">return</a> becomes lower after factoring in premium payments over time.\n"]}
