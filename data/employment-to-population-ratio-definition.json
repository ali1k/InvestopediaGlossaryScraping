Those not included in the labor force count include military personnel, federal government employees, retirees, handicapped or discouraged workers, and some agricultural workers.\n", "\nThe employment-to-population ratio does not include the institutionalized population, such as people in mental hospitals and prisons, or people in school who are studying for a career.

These workers may be counted in the \"employed\" side of the ratio but may not be included in the total number of people of working age. As a result, their employment inaccurately increases the ratio.\n", "\nUnsurprisingly, based on the characteristics outlined above, the employment-to-population ratio does not directly relate to the unemployment rate. For example, in February 2020 the employment-to-population ratio was 61.1%, but the unemployment rate was only 3.5%.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff <span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff Together these numbers only account for 64.6% of the population. This necessarily raises the question of what happened to the remaining third of the population.\n", "\nThe largest discrepancy between these two numbers exists because the unemployment figure does not indicate the number of people without employment. People who want a job but have given up on their quest to find one are not included in the nation\u2019s unemployment number. The unemployment rate usually only indicates the number of unemployed people who are actively looking for jobs.\u00a0It also does not include those who have exhausted their unemployment benefits, which may artificially inflate the employment-to-population ratio.\n", "\nPeople who have retired early and those who have decided to go back to school to further their job prospects are not taken into account in the unemployment figure. However, their absence from the workforce is accounted for in the employment-to-population ratio.\n", "\nAdditionally, while the E/P attempts to \"quantify\" employment numbers, it fails to \"qualify\" the nature of that number. That means that if 100,000 people with graduate degrees and decades of work experience were laid off from jobs paying $200K per year and were then rehired to stock the shelves at a national supermarket chain for $15k per year, the Employment-to-Population Ratio would look stable, even though the economic impact would be devastating.\n"]}
