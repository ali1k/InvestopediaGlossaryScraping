It is based on the most recent 30-day period covered by the fund's filings with the SEC. The yield figure reflects the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp\">dividends</a> and interest earned during the period after the deduction of the fund's expenses. It is also referred to as the \"standardized yield.\"\n", "\nThe SEC yield is used to compare <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bondfund.asp\">bond funds</a> because it captures the effective rate of interest an investor may receive in the future. It is widely considered a good way to compare mutual funds or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp\">exchange-traded funds (ETFs)</a> because this yield measure is generally very consistent from month to month. The resulting yield calculation shows investors what they would earn in yield over the course of a 12-month period if the fund continued earning the same rate for the rest of the year. It is mandatory for funds to calculate this yield. This yield differs from the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/distribution-yield.asp\">Distribution Yield</a>, which is typically displayed on a bond's website.\n", "\nMost funds calculate a 30-day SEC yield on the last day of each month, though U.S. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/money-marketfund.asp\">money market funds</a> calculate and report a seven-day SEC yield. The standardized formula for the 30-day SEC yield consists of four variables:\n", "\na = interest and dividends received over the last 30-day period\n", "\nb = accrued expenses over the last 30-day period, excluding reimbursements\n", "\nc = the average number of shares outstanding, on a daily basis, which were entitled to receive distributions\n", "\nd = the maximum price per share on the day of the calculation, the last day of the period\n", "\nThe formula of the annualized 30-day SEC yield is:\n", "\n2 x (((a - b) / (c x d) + 1) ^ 6 - 1)\n", "\nAssume Investment Fund X earned $12,500 in dividends and $3,000 in interest. The fund also recorded $6,000 worth of expense, of which $2,000 was reimbursed. The fund has 150,000 shares entitled to receive distributions, and on the last day of the period, the day the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/y/yield.asp\">yield</a> is being calculated, the highest price the shares reached was $75.
