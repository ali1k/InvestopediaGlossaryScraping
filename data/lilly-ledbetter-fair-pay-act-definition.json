The act allows individuals who face pay discrimination to seek rectification under federal anti-discrimination laws.\n", "\nThe law clarifies that discrimination based on age, religion, national origin, race, sex, and disability will \u201caccrue\u201d every time the employee receives a paycheck that is deemed discriminatory.

Goodyear Tire and\u00a0Rubber Co.</em> in 2007.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff It restored previous protections\u00a0regarding the equal treatment of employees, most notably Title VII of the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/civil-rights-act-1964.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Civil Rights Act of 1964</a>.

In 1998 Ledbetter filed an equal-pay lawsuit alleging pay discrimination on the basis of sex under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
