On Halloween, Oct. 31, 2006, Canada\u2019s minister of finance, Jim Flaherty, announced that all income trusts would be taxed in a similar manner as corporations at a rate of over 30% on taxable income, causing unitholders\u2019 values to decrease dramatically virtually overnight.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff\n", "\nIncome trusts, which were permitted to make distributions to unitholders on a pretax basis under previous Canadian income tax laws, were a popular investment vehicle in the early 2000s, especially in Canada. The Canadian energy sector was hardest hit by the change, and suffered an estimated loss of about 17.85% in value over the 10 days following the announcement (about $35 billion) to investors, giving rise to the term \"massacre.\"<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff\n", "\nA <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/canadianincometrust.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Canadian income trust</a> is an investment fund that holds income-producing assets and distributes payments to unitholders, or shareholders, on a regular basis. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/distribution.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Distributions</a> are usually made quarterly or monthly.

The trust entity distributes most of its cash to shareholders or unitholders, leaving little left to be retained by the entity, so there is little left to tax. The trust pays out most of the earnings to unitholders before paying taxes, and it is usually traded publicly on a securities exchange.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"5\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff\n", "\nThis change in the Canadian tax law, which was largely debated after the fact, was made to remedy a perceived loss of tax revenue.\u00a0At the time, noted Bloomberg News, there were some 250 trusts listed on the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/toronto-stock-exchange-tsx.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Toronto Stock Exchange</a>, with many offering enticing <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/y/yield.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">yields</a> of 10%.

Nevertheless, as of 2020, income trusts were still available, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/04/030304.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">many of them real estate investment trusts (REITs)</a>.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff These entities hold and maintain\u00a0income-producing real estate\u2014including office buildings, shopping centers, and hotels\u2014and Canada still offers special tax treatment.

As of the end of September 2020, Canadian REITs have underperformed with a negative 20% return over the past 12 months. The pandemic\u2019s effect on real estate, including tenant insolvency, empty storefronts, reduced retail business, and closed shops, restaurants, and more, is to blame, and Blair predicts that \u201crecovery size and pace will likely have less to do with traditional REIT financial metrics and more to do with investor confidence.\u201d<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"7\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff\n"]}
