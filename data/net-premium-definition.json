The net premium calculation does not take into account future expenses associated with maintaining the insurance policy.\n", "\nNet premiums, along with gross premiums, help an insurance company to determine how much it owes in state taxes.\n", "\nAn <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurance.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">insurance</a> policy's net premium value differs from the policy\u2019s gross premium value, which does take into account future expenses. The calculated difference between net premium and gross premium equals the expected PV of expense loadings, <em>minus </em>the expected PV of future expenses. Thus, a policy\u2019s gross value will be less than its net value when the value of future expenses is less than the PV of those expense loadings.\n", "\nBecause the net premium calculation does not take into account expenses, companies must determine how much expense they can add without causing a loss. Types of expenses that a company must account for include <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commission.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">commissions</a> paid to agents who sell the policies, legal expenses associated with settlements, salaries, taxes, clerical costs, and other general expenses.\n", "\nCommissions typically vary with the policy\u2019s premium, but general and legal expenses may not be tied to the premium.\n", "\nTo estimate allowed expenses, a company can add a fixed amount of expenses to the net premium (called flat loading), add a percentage of the premium, or add a combination of a fixed amount and a percentage of the premium.\n", "\nWhen comparing policies with different net premiums, adding a fixed amount will lead to the same proportion of expenses to premiums as long as expenses do vary by proportion to the premium. Determining which method to use depends on the general and legal expenses associated with the policy, as they relate to commissions on the premium.\n", "\nMost policy calculations leave a margin for <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/contingency.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">contingencies</a>, such as when the money made from investing the premiums turns out to be less than expected.\n", "\nNet premiums and gross premiums\u00a0are helpful in figuring out how much an insurance company owes in taxes. State insurance departments often\u00a0tax\u00a0insurance companies' income. Tax laws, however, may allow companies to reduce their\u00a0gross premium by figuring in\u00a0expenses and\u00a0unearned premiums.\n", "\nFor example, if the state of Ohio imposes a tax on gross premiums written by Ohio insurance companies, but the tax does not apply to amounts deducted for reinsurance, it also won't\u00a0apply to gross premiums not earned because the insurance company or policyholder canceled a policy before it expired.\n"]}
