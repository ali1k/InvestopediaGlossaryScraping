It is an effort an individual or organization undertakes based on an altruistic desire to improve human welfare.

The money helped students and faculty keep the academy running.\n", "\nAround 150 years later, Pliny the Younger contributed one-third of the funds for a Roman school for young boys. He instructed the fathers of the students to come up with the rest. The intention was to keep young Romans educated in the city rather than abroad.\n", "\nIn 1630, John Winthrop of the Massachusetts Bay Colony preached to Puritan settlers that the rich have an obligation to take care of the poor. Meanwhile, the poor must do the best they can to improve their situation. Three years later, John Eliot wrote a letter to Sir Simonds D\u2019Ewes asking for money to found a college in Massachusetts. In 1638, John Harvard laid the foundations for <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/harvard-business.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Harvard University</a> after bequeathing half of his estate to found the school.\n", "\nMany people in the United States give money to causes in which they believe.
