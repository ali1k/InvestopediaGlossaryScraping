A knock-out option sets a cap on the level an option can reach in the holder's favor.\n", "\nAs knock-out options limit the profit potential for the option buyer, they can be purchased for a smaller <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option-premium.asp\">premium</a>\u00a0than an equivalent option without a knock-out stipulation.\n", "\nA knock-out can be compared with a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/knock-inoption.asp\">knock-in option</a>.\n", "\nA knock-out option is a type of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/barrieroption.asp\">barrier option</a>. Barrier options are typically classified as either knock-out or knock-in. A knock-out option ceases to exist if the underlying asset reaches a\u00a0predetermined barrier during its life. A knock-in option is effectively the opposite of the knock-out. Here, the option is activated only if the underlying asset reaches a predetermined barrier price.\n", "\nKnock-out options are considered to be <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exoticoption.asp\">exotic options</a>, and they are primarily used in commodity and currency markets by large institutions.

It gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to purchase or sell an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underlying-asset.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">underlying asset</a> at a predetermined strike price\u2014if the underlying asset's price does not go <em>below</em> a specified barrier during the option's life. Should the underlying asset's price fall below the barrier at any point in the option's life, the option expires worthless.\n", "\nFor example, assume an investor purchases a down-and-out <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">call option</a> on a stock that is trading at $60, with a\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strikeprice.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">strike price</a> of $55 and a barrier of $50. If the stock trades below $50, at any time, before the call option expires then the down-and-out call option promptly ceases to exist.\u00a0\n", "\nContrary to a down-and-out barrier option, an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/up-and-outoption.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">up-and-out barrier option</a> gives the holder the right to buy or sell an underlying asset at a specified strike price if the asset has not <em>exceeded</em> a specified barrier during the option's life. An up-and-out option is only knocked out if the price of the underlying asset moves above the barrier.\n", "\nAssume an investor purchases an up-and-out <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/putoption.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">put option</a> on a stock trading at $40, with a strike price of $30 and a barrier of $45. Over the life of the option, the stock hits a high of $46 but then drops to $20 per share. Too bad: the option still would automatically expire because the barrier of $45 had been breached. Now, if the stock hadn't gone above $45 and eventually sold off to $20, then the option would remain in place and have value to the holder.\n", "\nA knock-out option may be used for several different reasons. As mentioned, the premiums on these options are typically cheaper than a non-knock-out counterpart.\u00a0A trader may also feel that the odds of the underlying asset hitting the barrier price is remote and conclude that the cheaper\u00a0option is worth the risk of unlikely being knocked out of the trade.\u00a0\n", "\nFinally, these types of options may also be beneficial to institutions\u00a0who are only interested in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedge.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hedging</a> up or down to very specific prices or have very narrow <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risktolerance.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tolerances for risk</a>.\n", "\nKnock-out options limit losses.

Moreover, the knock-out feature is triggered even if the designated level is breached only briefly.
