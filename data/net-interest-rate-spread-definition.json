The net interest rate spread is a key determinant of a financial institution\u2019s profitability (or lack thereof).\n", "\nLoan-granting institutions, such as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commercialbank.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">commercial banks</a>, receive interest income from a number of sources. Deposits (often called <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/core-deposits.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">core deposits</a>) are a primary source, generally in the forms of checking and savings accounts or certificates of deposit (CDs). These are often obtained at low rates. Banks also obtain funds through shareholder equity, wholesale deposits, and debt issuance. Banks issue a variety of loans\u2014such as mortgages on property, home equity lending, student loans, car loans, and credit card lending\u2014that are offered at higher interest rates.\n", "\nThe primary business of a bank is managing the spread between <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/043015/what-economic-factors-affect-savings-account-rates.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the interest rate on deposits that it pays consumers</a> and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/who-determines-interest-rates/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the rate it receives from their loans</a>. In other words,\u00a0when the interest that a bank earns from loans is greater than the interest it\u00a0pays on deposits, it generates income from the\u00a0interest rate spread.\u00a0In simple terms, net interest rates spreads are like <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profitmargin.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">profit margins</a>.\n", "\nThe greater the spread, the more profitable the financial institution is likely to be. However, this is just the basic view, and financial institutions work on creative customer acquisition, customer retention and loyalty and principal investing strategies. Their individual strategies help them compete and differentiate themselves from other financial institutions.\n", "\nMost commercial banks (such as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federal-savings-and-loan.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">savings and loans</a>) generate their main source of profits through net interest rates spreads. For instance, they may credit depositors 1.25% on their money while issuing a mortgage to a home buyer charging 4.75%. In this case the net interest rate spread would be 3.5%, minus any fees or costs incurred by the bank in effecting both transactions.\n", "\nAlthough we won\u2019t delve into how rates are determined in the market, several factors drive\u00a0rates, including monetary policy set by the\u00a0Federal Reserve Bank and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/062315/which-economic-factors-impact-treasury-yields.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the\u00a0yields on U.S. Treasuries</a>.

Indeed, according to the U.S. Federal Reserve, the federal funds rate is \u201cthe interest rate at which depository institutions lend reserve balances to other depository institutions overnight.\u201d\n", "\nThis applies to the biggest, most creditworthy institutions as they maintain the mandated amount of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/requiredreserves.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reserve required</a>. Thus, the fed funds rate is a base interest rate, one by which all other interest rates in the U.S. are determined. The fed funds rate is a key indicator of the health of the U.S. economy.\n"]}
