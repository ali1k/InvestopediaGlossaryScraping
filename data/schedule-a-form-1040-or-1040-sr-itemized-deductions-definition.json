Claiming <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/itemizeddeduction.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">itemized deductions</a> is an alternative to taking the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standarddeduction.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">standard deduction</a>, and taxpayers can use whichever option will give them greater savings.\n", "\nA number of deductions that were once available to taxpayers disappeared with the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/taxes/trumps-tax-reform-plan-explained/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tax Cuts and Jobs Act</a> passed in 2017. They include deductions for casualty and theft losses not in a disaster area; interest on home equity loans that were used for purposes other than buying, building, or improving a home; and \"miscellaneous deductions,\" which included tax preparation fees and job-related expenses that an employer didn't reimburse.\n", "\nThe new law also limited the amount that taxpayers can deduct for state and local taxes to a maximum of $10,000, or $5,000 for married taxpayers filing separately.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff At the same time, the law nearly doubled the standard deduction. The figures are adjusted annually:\n", "\nAs a consequence of these changes, many taxpayers who itemized their deductions on Schedule A in years past have found it more advantageous (not to mention easier) to claim the standard deduction.\n", "\nFor residents of high-tax states, the $10,000 limit on deducting state local taxes alone may be the deciding factor. If a married couple can't scrape up at least another $14,000 in eligible deductions on top of the $10,000, they'll be better off taking the standard deduction.\n", "\nThat was already the case for the majority of taxpayers, whose eligible deductions added up to less than the standard deduction even under the old rules. They have the added advantage of not needing to keep track of their expenses or collect piles of receipts. What's more, itemized deductions are subject to challenge by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), while taking the standard deduction is not.\n", "\nHowever, if a taxpayer still has enough eligible expenses to exceed the standard deduction, filing Schedule A continues to make sense. For taxpayers with the highest home prices, mortgage interest is a good benchmark for deciding which deduction to choose. If your annual mortgage interest (as reported to you by your bank on a Mortgage Interest Statement, or Form 1098) is higher than the standard deduction, it is already to your advantage to itemize deductions instead of filing for the standard deduction.\n", "\nIf you're thinking of buying a new home, note that the law now limits deductible mortgage interest to the first $750,000 of debt for any loans taken out after Dec. 15, 2017. Previously, the limit was $1 million.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"9\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nAll versions of Schedule A are available on the IRS website.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"6\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nThe <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i1040sca\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">instructions for Schedule A</a> explain which of your expenses are deductible and where they should be listed on the form.\n", "\nSchedule A requires taxpayers to list their deductible expenses in any or all of six designated categories:\n", "\nLike the standard deduction, the itemized deductions on Schedule A are subtracted from the taxpayer's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/agi.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">adjusted gross income</a> (AGI) to determine taxable income.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"8\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nAs has always been the case, if you elect to itemize your deductions, you need to save documentation of eligible expenses throughout the year.
