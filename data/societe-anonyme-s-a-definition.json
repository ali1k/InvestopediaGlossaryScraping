A soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme is the equivalent of a corporation in the United States (publicly-traded company or incorporated), a public limited company in the United Kingdom, or an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/ag-aktiengesellschaft.asp\">Aktiengesellschaft (AG)</a> in Germany. A soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme is a type of business structure that establishes a company as a legal person that can own and transfer property, enter contracts, and be held liable for crimes. One of its key benefits is that it limits the owners\u2019 personal liability for the company\u2019s actions.\n", "\nThe soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme is a popular <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/073015/what-are-requirements-being-public-limited-company.asp\">business structure</a> with equivalents in many other languages and countries. For example, in Spanish it is called a Sociedad An\u00f3nima; in Italian, it is referred to as a\u00a0Societ\u00e0 Anonima; in Portuguese, it is called a Sociedade An\u00f4nima. In all cases, a company designated S.A. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/08/asset-protection-business.asp\">protects its owners\u2019 personal assets</a> against claims by creditors, which makes many individuals more willing to start companies, as it limits their risk.\n", "\nThe S.A. structure also makes it easier to meet a growing business\u2019 capital-funding needs, as numerous investors can contribute large or small amounts of money as shareholders if the company <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/difference-between-publicly-and-privately-held-companies/\">opts for public ownership</a>. The S.A. is thus a key component of a robust capitalist economy.\n", "\nOn Jan. 1, 1808, the French government put into effect the provisions regarding the formation and structure of a soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme as part of the country's new code regulating commerce. One purpose of these new regulations was to prevent the rampant <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/speculation.asp\">speculation</a> that had rocked the French markets prior to and during the French Revolution. The code recognized three forms of business organization: the soci\u00e9t\u00e9 en nom collectif, the soci\u00e9t\u00e9 en commandite, and the soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme.\n", "\nA soci\u00e9t\u00e9 en nom collectif is a standard partnership in which all partners have <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unlimited-liability.asp\">unlimited liability</a>, any partner could act for the others, and all partners are actively engaged in the enterprise. By comparison, the soci\u00e9t\u00e9 en commandite is comprised of limited partners (also known as sleeping or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/silentpartner.asp\">silent partners</a>) and active partners. The limited partners provide assets or capital to the enterprise and have limited liability, while the active partners are responsible for all management activities and have unlimited liability.\n", "\nAn S.A. is subject to different tax regulations than a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/soleproprietorship.asp\">sole proprietorship</a> or partnership, and, in the case of a public S.A., different accounting and auditing requirements. In addition, all S.A.s must meet certain basic legal requirements. To be valid, a soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme must have <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/articlesofincorporation.asp\">articles of incorporation</a>, a board of directors, a managing director or a management board, a supervisory board, a statutory auditor and deputy, capital of at least 37,000 euros (half of which must be released at the constitution of the company, with the balance to be paid within five years), and a unique name. It is generally constituted for 99 years maximum.\n", "\nOther regulatory requirements vary by country. In Belgium, for example, an S.A. must be funded with at least \u20ac61,500 (as of 2018), 25% of which must be deposited during the incorporation process, and have at least two <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/partnership.asp\">partners</a>. In Costa Rica, nonresidents can start an S.A. without a Costa Rican partner. There are typically fees, which vary by location, for completing the various legal steps for forming an S.A. Well-known companies that are established as S.A.s include Nestl\u00e9, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/investing/biggest-mergers-in-history/\">Anheuser-Busch InBev</a>, and L\u2019Or\u00e9al.\n", "\nMany other countries and languages employ the soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme structure.
