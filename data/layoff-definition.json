A layoff is not the same thing as an outright firing, which may result from worker inefficiency, malfeasance, or breach of duty.\n", "\nIn its initial context, a layoff was meant to denote a temporary work interruption, but over time, the term has morphed to\u00a0describe a permanent lack of work. A layoff may happen to a displaced worker whose job has been eliminated because an employer has shuttered its operation or relocated. A worker may likewise be replaced due to a production slowdown or cessation.\n", "\nLayoffs may happen for a variety of reasons that may affect an individual or a group of workers, in both the public and private sectors. Generally, layoffs are conducted to reduce salary expenditures, in an effort to increase shareholder value. Layoffs may occur when an employer's strategic business objectives or processes change, in the face of\u00a0declining revenue, the adoption of automation, or the offshoring or outsourcing.\n", "\nGiven that layoffs are understandably unpopular with workers, the term\u00a0has a number of\u00a0synonyms, as well as several euphemisms. For example, layoffs\u00a0may also be referred to as\u00a0a \"<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/downsize.asp\">downsizing</a>,\" \"rightsizing\" or a \"smartsizing.\"\u00a0\n", "\nSimilarly, a laid-off worker may become unemployed as part of a \"workforce reduction,\" \"reduction in force,\" \"redeployment\" or an \"excess reduction.\" Employees in a late-career layoff may be given \"<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forced-retirement.asp\">early retirement</a>,\" meaning they will stop working and cease collecting a paycheck but will remain eligible for retirement benefits.\n", "\nWhile workers bear the brunt of layoffs with lost wages and the uncertainty of unemployment, the\u00a0effects of layoffs are also felt\u00a0in local and national economies. They likewise impact the workers who remain employed, following such workforce reductions.\n", "\nFor example, workers who have witnessed their colleagues being laid off report greater anxiety and increased concerns over their own job security. This often results in reduced motivation, and employee attrition. Workers who have been subject a layoff may also feel a level of distrust toward future employers, which is why some companies may try to lay off multiple workers at once, in order to soften the psychological blow and make sure people do not feel singled out.\n", "\nMass layoffs may create a sizable impact on the economy and tax base of a community or region and may create a ripple effect among related industries across a country.\n", "\nIn the United States, data on\u00a0layoffs is collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics,\u00a0which tracks\u00a0unemployment insurance claims. Its <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www.bls.gov/mls/\">Mass Layoff Statistics (MLS)</a> program\u00a0collects reports on mass layoff actions that result in workers being separated from their jobs. A mass layoff in this context involves 50 or more workers.\n"]}
