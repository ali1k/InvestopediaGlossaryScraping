Total return includes interest, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalgain.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">capital gains</a>, dividends, and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/distribution.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">distributions</a> realized over a period. Total return accounts for two categories of return: income including interest paid by fixed-income investments, distributions, or dividends and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalappreciation.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">capital appreciation</a>, representing the change in the market price of an asset.\n", "\nTotal return is the amount of value an investor earns from a security over a specific period, typically one year, when all distributions are reinvested. Total return is expressed as a percentage of the amount invested. For example, a total return of 20% means the security increased by 20% of its original value due to a price increase, distribution of dividends (if a stock), <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coupon.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">coupons</a> (if a bond), or capital gains (if a fund). Total return is a strong measure of an investment\u2019s overall performance.\n", "\nSome of the best dividend stocks have low growth potential and produce small capital gains. Basing an investment\u2019s <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnoncapitalgains.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">return on capital gains</a> alone does not take into consideration price increases or other methods of growing the stock\u2019s value. For example, an investor buys shares of Company B, and the share price increases 24.5% in one year. The investor gains 24.5% from the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-change.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">price change</a> alone.

It is important to evaluate the big picture and not just one return metric when determining an increase in value.\n", "\nTotal return is used when analyzing a company\u2019s historical performance. Calculating expected future return puts reasonable expectations on an investor\u2019s investments and helps plan for retirement or other needs.\n", "\nWhen analyzing <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutualfund.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mutual fund</a> performance, investors should analyze their average annual total returns for different periods. Comparing returns to a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/benchmark.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">benchmark</a> indicates how the fund has performed, relative to an index. When analyzing average annual total returns, it's important to remember:\n", "\nAn investor buys 100 shares of Stock A at $20 per share for an initial value of $2,000.
