Noncurrent assets appear on a company's balance sheet.\n", "\nNoncurrent assets are also referred to as long-term assets. Noncurrent assets are capitalized rather than expensed, meaning that the company allocates the cost of the asset over the number of years for which the asset will be in use instead of allocating the entire cost to the accounting year in which the asset was purchased. Depending on the type of asset, it may be depreciated, amortized, or depleted.\u00a0\n", "\nThe assets\u00a0section of the balance sheet is segmented according to the type of asset quantified (current assets, PP&amp;E, other assets, etc.).\u00a0The leading section is \"current assets,\"\u00a0which are short-term assets that can be converted into cash within one year or one operating cycle.\u00a0Current assets include items such as cash, accounts receivable, and inventory.\u00a0Noncurrent assets are always classified on the balance sheet under one of the following headings: investment; property, plant, and equipment; intangible assets; or other assets. Investments are classified as noncurrent only if they are not expected to turn into unrestricted cash within the next 12 months of the balance sheet date. Property, plant, and equipment\u2014which may also be called <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixedasset.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fixed assets</a>\u2014encompass land, buildings, and machinery including vehicles. Finally, intangible assets are goods that have no physical presence. Although they may be created, such as a patent, intangible assets may also arise from the sale or purchase of business units.\n", "\nOther noncurrent assets include the cash surrender value of life insurance. A bond sinking fund established for the future repayment of debt is classified as a noncurrent asset. Some deferred income taxes, goodwill, trademarks, and unamortized bond issue costs are noncurrent assets\u00a0as well.\n", "\nPrepaid assets may be classified as noncurrent assets if the future benefit is not to be received within one year. For example, if rent is prepaid for the next 24 months, 12 months is considered a current asset as the benefit will be used within the year. The other 12 months are considered noncurrent as the benefit will not be received until the following year.\n", "\nIt is not uncommon for capital-intensive industries to have a large portion of their <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset-base.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">asset base</a> composed of noncurrent assets. An example of such a company is an oil refinery. Conversely, service businesses may require minimal to no use of fixed assets. Therefore, while a high proportion of noncurrent assets to current assets may indicate poor liquidity, this may also simply be a function of the respective company\u2019s industry.\n"]}
