Essentially, the total capital gains earned are distributed according to a cascading structure made up of sequential tiers, hence the reference to a waterfall. When one tier's allocation requirements are fully satisfied, the excess funds are then subject to the allocation requirements of the next tier, and so on.\n", "\nThough waterfall schedules may be customized, generally the four tiers in a distribution waterfall are:\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hurdlerate.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hurdle rates</a> for the schedule also may be tiered, depending on the total amount of carried interest of the general partners.
