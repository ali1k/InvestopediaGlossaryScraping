A derivative is a financial instrument with a price that is based on a different asset.\u00a0\n", "\nUnderlying assets give derivatives their value. For example, an option on\u00a0stock XYZ gives the holder the right to buy or sell XYZ at the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/strike-price/\">strike price</a>\u00a0up until expiration. The underlying asset for the\u00a0option is the stock of XYZ.\n", "\nAn underlying asset can be used to identify the item within the agreement that provides value to the contract. The underlying asset supports the security involved in the agreement, which the parties involved agree to exchange as part of the derivative contract.\n", "\nThe price of an option\u00a0or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futures.asp\">futures</a> contract is derived from the price of an underlying asset. In an option contract, the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/writing-an-option.asp\">writer</a>\u00a0must either buy\u00a0or sell the underlying asset to the buyer on the specified date at the agreed-upon price. The buyer is not obligated to purchase the underlying asset, but they can exercise their right if they choose to do so. If the option is about to expire, and the underlying asset has not moved favorably enough to make exercising the option worthwhile, the buyer can let the expire and they will lose the amount they paid for the option.\n", "\nFutures are an obligation to the buyer and a seller. The seller of the future agrees to provide the underlying asset at expiry, and the buyer of the contract agrees to buy the underlying at expiry. The price they receive and pay, respectively, is the price they entered the futures contract at. Most futures traders close out their positions prior to expiration since retail traders and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedgefund.asp\">hedge funds</a> have little need to take physical possession of barrels of oil, for example. But, they can buy or sell the contract at one price, and if it moves favorably they can exit the trade and\u00a0make a profit that way. Futures are a derivative because the price of an oil futures contract is based on the price movement of oil, for example.\n", "\nIn cases involving stock options, the underlying asset is\u00a0the stock itself. For example, with a stock option to purchase 100 shares of Company X at a price of $100,\u00a0the underlying asset is the stock of Company X. The underlying asset is\u00a0used to determine the value of the option up till expiration. The value of the underlying asset may change before the expiration of the contract, affecting the value of the\u00a0option. The value of the underlying asset at any given time lets traders know whether the option is worth\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exercise.asp\">exercising</a>\u00a0or not.\n", "\nThe underlying asset could also be a currency or\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketindex.asp\">market index</a>, such as the S&amp;P 500. In the case of stock indexes, the underlying asset is comprised of the common stocks within the stock market index.\n"]}
