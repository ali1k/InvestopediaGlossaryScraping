When a company starts the IPO process, a specific set of events take place facilitated by chosen bank underwriters.\n", "\nCompanies that opt to issue stock via an IPO can raise a substantial amount of money in a short time, particularly if the issuance attracts public\u00a0attention and becomes a hot IPO.\u00a0An initial public offering gives a private company a chance to cash in on the public\u2019s demand for its shares.\n", "\nWhen a company decides to make such an offering, it typically finds one or more investment banks to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underwriting.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">underwrite</a> the issuance and make arrangements to sell shares on public stock exchanges. The underwriters market the IPO as they help the company set a per-share price. The underwriting banks will assume a specific number of shares, which they will offer to their buyers, and collect a portion of the sale proceeds as a fee. These buyers may be institutional or retail clients. The part they receive is\u00a0the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underwritingspread.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">underwriting spread</a>.\n", "\nHot IPOs\u00a0appeal to investors who anticipate that the demand for shares will outstrip the number of shares offered.\u00a0IPOs with more demand than supply are considered\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/oversubscribed.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">oversubscribed</a>, making them a target for short-term speculators as well as those who see a long-term opportunity in holding the equity.\n", "\nAlso, increased\u00a0demand for the shares will lead to a sharp rise in the price of the stock soon after it begins trading. Usually, this sudden increase in share price is not sustainable.\n", "\nBecause a hot IPO is likely to be oversubscribed, companies will often permit their underwriters to increase the size of the offering to accommodate more investors and make more money. The trick for underwriters lies in balancing the size of the IPO with the appropriate price for the amount of interest in the shares. When done correctly, this balancing will maximize profit for the company and its underwriter banks.\n", "\nIf a hot IPO is an\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underpricing.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">underpriced</a> issue, it will usually see a rapid rise in price after the shares hit the market and the market adjusts to the high demand for the stock. Conversely, overpricing the IPO can lead to a rapid fall in prices, even though the higher price benefits the underwriting bank issuing the stock since it only makes money on the initial issue.\n", "\nInitial shareholders are significantly affected by sharp moves in price after trading opens to the general public. Underwriters sometimes give preferential treatment to high-value clients when offering shares in a hot IPO, so they bear some risk if they overprice the stock.\u00a0However, a hot IPO does not provide a guaranteed\u00a0win for investors. Sometimes the hype of an upcoming IPO does not bear the planned fruit for the investor.\n", "\nSuch was the case when social giant Facebook announced its plans to go public.\u00a0In early 2012,\u00a0analysts\u00a0indicated that the long-awaited Facebook IPO, seeking to raise about $10.6 billion by selling more than 337 million shares at $28 to $35 per share, could generate such significant interest from investors. These analysts predicted\u00a0an oversubscribed IPO.\n", "\nAt the market opening on May 18, 2012, as\u00a0predicted, investor interest\u00a0showed there was more demand for Facebook shares than the company was offering.\u00a0To take advantage of the oversubscribed IPO and fulfill investor demand, Facebook increased the number of shares to 421 million but also raised the price range to $34 to $38 per share.\n", "\nIn effect, Facebook and its underwriters raised both the supply and price of shares to meet demand and diminish the securities\u00a0oversubscription. However, it quickly became clear that Facebook was not oversubscribed at its IPO price, as the stock fell precipitously in its first four months of trading. The stock failed to trade above its IPO price until July 31, 2013.\n"]}
