Most policies come with some form of fire protection, but homeowners may be able to purchase additional coverage in case their property is lost or damaged because of fire. Purchasing additional fire coverage helps to\u00a0cover\u00a0the cost of replacement, repair, or reconstruction of property above the limit set by the property insurance policy.\u00a0Fire insurance policies typically contain general exclusions such as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/war-risk-insurance.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">war</a>, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nuclear-hazards-clause.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">nuclear risks</a>, and similar perils.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/homeowners-insurance.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Homeowners insurance</a> provides policyholders with coverage against loss and/or damage to their homes and possessions, also referred to as insured <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/property.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">property</a>. This is a blanket term used to describe both the interior and exterior of the home as well as any <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">assets</a> that are kept on the property itself. Policies may also cover injuries someone sustains while on the property. If you have a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortgage.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mortgage</a>, there's a very good chance that your <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"5\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lender.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lender</a> won't advance your loan if your property isn't covered. Even if it isn't a requirement, it's a good idea to protect yourself. There are additional forms of coverage you can purchase including fire insurance.\n", "\nFire insurance covers a policyholder against fire loss or damage from a number of sources. These include fires brought about by electricity, such as faulty wiring and gas explosions, as\u00a0well as those caused by lightning and natural disasters.\u00a0A burst and overflowing water tank or pipes may also be covered by the policy.\n", "\nMost policies provide coverage regardless of whether the fire originates from inside or outside of the home. The limit of coverage\u00a0depends\u00a0on the cause of the fire. The policy <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reimbursement.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reimburses</a>\u00a0the policyholder on either a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/replacementcost.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">replacement-cost basis</a>\u00a0or an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/actual-cash-value.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">actual cash value</a> (ACV) basis for damages.\n", "\nIf the home is considered a total loss, the insurance company may actually reimburse the home's current <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketvalue.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">market value</a>. The insurance typically provides a market value compensation for lost possessions, with the total <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/payout.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">payout</a>\u00a0capped\u00a0based on the home's overall value. If, for example, a policy insures a house for $350,000, the contents are usually covered for at least 50% to 70% of the policy value\u2014or a range of $175,000 to $245,000. Many policies limit how much reimbursement\u00a0covers\u00a0luxury\u00a0items such as paintings, jewelry, gold, and fur coats.\n", "\nA policyholder should check the home's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/value.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">value</a> each year to determine if there is a need to increase the coverage amount. A policyholder cannot\u00a0get insurance\u00a0for more than a home's actual value. Insurance companies may offer stand-alone policies for rare, expensive, and irreplaceable items that are otherwise not covered in standard fire insurance.\n", "\nSome standard <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/1211/what-is-and-isnt-covered-by-homeowners-insurance.aspx\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">homeowners insurance policies</a> include coverage for fire, but they may not be extensive enough for some homeowners.

Fire insurance policies on the verge of expiration are usually renewable by the homeowner, under the same terms as the original policy.\n"]}
