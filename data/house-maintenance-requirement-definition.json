House maintenance requirement levels are based on the standards set out in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/regulationt.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Regulation T</a> of the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalreservebank.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Federal Reserve</a>.\n", "\nAlthough Regulation T specifies the minimum maintenance requirements permitted by law,<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brokerage-company.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">brokerage firms</a> are free to adjust their own \u201chouse\u201d maintenance requirements provided that their standards are more rigorous\u2014that is, higher\u2014than the minimum requirements set out in Regulation T.\n", "\nThe purpose of maintenance requirements is to ensure that investors using margin accounts to make <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leverage.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">leveraged investments</a> do not find themselves unable to repair their <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margin_loan_availability.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">margin loans</a>. In this manner, maintenance requirements are intended to reduce credit risk for the brokerage firms. By extension, they aim to reduce the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/systemic-risk.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">systemic risk</a> that might otherwise arise from widespread <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/default2.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">defaults</a> by margin traders.\n", "\nAccording to Regulation T, margin traders must maintain equity levels of at least 25% of the value of their investments.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff If they fail to maintain this level, they may find themselves subject to a margin call by their broker.\n", "\nIn this situation, the trader would be required to promptly deposit additional <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/collateral.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">collateral</a> into their account. If they fail to do so, their broker can <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidation.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">liquidate</a> their investment positions in order to pay back their margin. Any outstanding balance of the loan would then need to be repaid separately by the margin trader.\n", "\nDuring <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bullmarket.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bull markets</a>, margin traders may find their maintenance requirements to be unduly restrictive. After all, at a time when asset prices are generally rising, it can be tempting to leverage as much as possible in order to maximize their <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnonequity.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">return on equity (ROE)</a>.\n", "\nHowever, the danger of this quickly reveals itself once the market begins to turn. During bear markets or periods of sudden financial shock such as occurred in the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/09/financial-crisis-review.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2007-2008 financial crisis</a>, margin traders are often faced with significant risk.\n", "\nThe decline in portfolio values, combined with the need to repay large margin loans on short notice due to margin calls, can sometimes force margin traders into significant financial duress.\n", "\nOften, these traders will forfeit all of the gains made in previous years, and may even be forced to liquidate other personal assets in order to repay their margin loans. Therefore, from this perspective, the need for maintenance requirements becomes much more clear.\n", "\nThe house maintenance requirement will often be higher than the maintenance margin set out by the Federal Reserve's Regulation T, which stipulates that an equity level of at least 25% must be maintained.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\u00a0\n", "\nIn addition to maintaining house maintenance requirements that are higher than the 25% mandated by Regulation T, brokerage firms often also have different house maintenance requirements for different account holders. Typically, this stratification is based on the size, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-worthiness.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">creditworthiness</a>, or perceived sophistication of the client.\n", "\nFor example, smaller and less experienced margin traders may be required to adhere to a 40% house maintenance requirement, while larger and more experienced clients may receive a 30% threshold.\n"]}
