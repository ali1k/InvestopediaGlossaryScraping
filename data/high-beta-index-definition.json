The S&amp;P 500 High Beta Index is the most well-known of these indexes. It tracks the performance of 100 companies in the S&amp;P 500 that are the most sensitive to changes in market returns.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beta.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Beta</a> is the amount of volatility\u00a0or systematic risk an asset exhibits compared to the market as a whole. Besides the flagship large-cap index, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sp.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Standard and\u00a0Poor's</a> offers a number of high beta variations for small-cap, mid-cap and other market indexes.\ufeff\u00a0\n", "\nHigh beta index companies exhibit greater sensitivity than the broader market. Sensitivity\u00a0is measured by the beta of an individual stock. A beta of 1 indicates the asset moves in line with the market. Anything less than 1 represents an asset less volatile than the market, while greater than 1 suggests a more volatile asset.\n", "\nFor example, a beta of 1.2 means the asset is 20% more volatile than the market. Conversely, a beta of 0.70 is theoretically 30% less volatile than the market. Beta is measured against a widely followed index such as the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sp500.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">S&amp;P 500 Index</a>.\u00a0\n", "\nGaining exposure to a high beta index requires an investment vehicle such as an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">exchange traded fund</a> (ETF). The Invesco S&amp;P 500 High Beta ETF (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=sphb\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SPHB</a>) is a widely traded asset that tracks volatile assets in the broader market. The ETF has underperformed the underlying S&amp;P 500 Index since its inception.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff Financial companies constitute nearly 30% of the fund's assets, with Discover Financial Services (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=dfs\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DFS</a>), Lincoln National Corp (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=lnc\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LNC</a>) and Invesco (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"5\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=ivz\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">IVZ</a>) among its largest holdings.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff\n", "\nContrary to popular belief, high beta or volatility doesn't necessarily translate into greater returns. For many years, the High Beta S&amp;P 500 Index has underperformed its underlying benchmark.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"5\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff This occurred during a period of unyielding improvement in the broader market.\n", "\nInstead, research shows that low volatility stocks tend to earn greater risk-adjusted returns than high volatility stocks. The reason low beta tends to outperform can be attributed to investment <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/behavioralfinance.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">behavioral\u00a0biases</a>, such as the representative heuristic and overconfidence. In addition, sector selection and other fundamental criteria play an important role in the volatility and performance of a high beta index.\n"]}
