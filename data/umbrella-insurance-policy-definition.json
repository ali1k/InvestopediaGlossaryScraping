It provides an additional layer of security to those who are at risk of being sued for damages to other people's property or injuries caused to others in an accident. It also protects against libel, vandalism, slander, and invasion of privacy.\n", "\nThe added coverage provided by an umbrella insurance policy is most useful to high net worth individuals who own a lot of assets\u2014or very expensive assets\u2014and are at a significant risk of being sued. Small businesses also use an umbrella insurance policy to guard against potential monetary damages arising due to claims.\n", "\nThe premium for an umbrella insurance policy may be less expensive if the policy is purchased from the same insurer that provided the original auto, home, or watercraft insurance. Depending on the provider, the policyholder who wants to add an umbrella insurance policy is required to have a base insurance coverage of $150,000 to $250,000 for <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/auto-insurance.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">auto insurance</a> and $250,000 to $300,000 for <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/homeowners-insurance.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">homeowners insurance</a>.\n", "\nUmbrella insurance is often referred to as\u00a0excess liability insurance. If a policyholder is\u00a0sued for damages that exceed the liability limits of\u00a0car insurance,\u00a0homeowners insurance,\u00a0or\u00a0other coverage types, an\u00a0umbrella policy helps pay what they owe. In other words, if the dollar limit of the original policy has been exhausted, the umbrella policy acts\u00a0as a fail-safe, so the insured person doesn't have to dip into savings and other assets.\n", "\nPeople who regularly purchase umbrella insurance will usually own expensive property or have significant savings. Or they may own dangerous things that can cause injury (swimming pools, trampolines, dogs, etc.). They might also engage in activities that increase their chances of lawsuits, such as:\n", "\nTo understand\u00a0how umbrella insurance can help, consider\u00a0the following scenario. If a driver\u00a0runs a red light and accidentally hits\u00a0another car, there might\u00a0be\u00a0significant damage to the vehicle\u00a0and several people might be\u00a0injured.\n", "\nWith car repairs totaling\u00a0$50,000\u00a0and the treatment of the injuries eclipsing\u00a0$500,000, the driver at fault may be liable for expenses that go far beyond the coverage limits of their insurance. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/040115/how-umbrella-insurance-works.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">An umbrella insurance policy</a> will pick up the additional liability costs beyond the limits of car insurance coverage.\n"]}
