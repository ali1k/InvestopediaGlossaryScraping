Purchasing more than 50% of a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/targetfirm.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">target firm's</a> stock and other assets allows the acquirer to make decisions about the newly acquired assets without the approval of the company\u2019s other shareholders.\u00a0Acquisitions, which are very common in business, may occur with the target company's approval, or in spite of its disapproval. With approval, there is often a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/no-shop-clause.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">no-shop clause</a> during the process.\n", "\nWe mostly hear about acquisitions of large well-known companies because these huge and significant deals tend to dominate the news. In reality, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mergersandacquisitions.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mergers and acquisitions</a> (M&amp;A) occur more regularly between small- to medium-size firms than between large companies.\n", "\nCompanies acquire other companies for various reasons. They may seek economies of scale, diversification, greater market share, increased synergy, cost reductions, or new niche offerings. Other reasons for acquisitions include those listed below.\n", "\nIf a company wants to expand its operations to another country, buying an existing company in that country could be the easiest way to enter a foreign market. The purchased business will already have its own personnel, a brand name, and other intangible assets, which could help to ensure that the acquiring company will start off in a new <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042215/how-does-performance-stock-market-affect-individual-businesses.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">market</a> with a solid base.\n", "\nPerhaps a company met with physical or logistical constraints or depleted its resources. If a company is encumbered in this way, then it's often sounder to acquire another firm than to expand its own. Such a company might look for promising young companies to acquire and incorporate into its revenue stream as a new way to profit.\n", "\nIf there is too much competition or supply, companies may look to acquisitions to reduce excess capacity, eliminate the competition, and focus on the most productive providers.\n", "\nSometimes it can be more cost-efficient for a company to purchase another company that already has implemented a new technology successfully than to spend the time and money to develop the new technology itself.\n", "\nAlthough technically, the words \"acquisition\" and \"<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/takeover.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">takeover</a>\" mean almost the same thing, they have different nuances on Wall Street. In general, \"acquisition\" describes a primarily amicable transaction, where both firms cooperate; \"takeover\" suggests that\u00a0the target company resists or strongly opposes the purchase; the term \"<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/043015/what-difference-between-accretive-and-dilutive-merger.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">merger</a>\" is used when the purchasing and target companies mutually combine to form a completely new entity. However, because each acquisition, takeover, and merger is a unique case, with its own peculiarities and reasons for undertaking the transaction, use of these terms tends to overlap.\n", "\nFriendly acquisitions occur when the target firm agrees to be acquired; its board of directors (B of D, or board) approves of the acquisition. Friendly acquisitions often work toward the mutual benefit of the acquiring and target companies. Both companies develop strategies to ensure that the acquiring company purchases the appropriate assets, and they review the financial statements and other valuations for any obligations that may come with the assets. Once both parties agree to the terms and meet any legal stipulations, the purchase proceeds.\n", "\nUnfriendly acquisitions, commonly known as \"hostile takeovers,\" occur when the target company does not consent to the acquisition. Hostile acquisitions don't have the same agreement from the target firm, and so the acquiring firm must actively purchase large stakes of the target company to gain a controlling interest, which forces the acquisition.\n", "\nEven if a takeover is not exactly hostile, it implies that the firms are not equal in one or more significant ways.\n", "\nAs the mutual fusion of two companies into one new legal entity, a merger is a more-than-friendly acquisition. Mergers generally occur between companies that are roughly equal in terms of their basic characteristics\u2014size, number of customers, the scale of operations, and so on. The merging companies strongly believe that their combined entity would be more valuable to all parties (especially <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/203.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">shareholders</a>) than either one could be alone.\n", "\nBefore making an acquisition, it is imperative for a company to evaluate whether its target company is a good candidate.\n", "\nIn corporate America, the 1990s will be remembered as the decade of the internet bubble and the megadeal. The late 1990s, in particular, spawned a series of multi-billion-dollar acquisitions not seen on Wall Street since the junk bond fests of the roaring 1980s. From Yahoo!'s 1999 $5.7-billion purchase of Broadcast.com to AtHome\u00a0Corporation's $7.5-billion purchase of Excite, companies were lapping up the \"growth now, profitability later\" phenomenon.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff <span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff Such acquisitions reached their zenith in the first few weeks of 2000.\n", "\nAOL Inc.
