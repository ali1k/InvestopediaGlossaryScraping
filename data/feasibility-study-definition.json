Project managers use feasibility studies to discern the pros and cons of undertaking a project before they invest a lot of time and money into it.\n", "\nFeasibility studies also can provide a company's management with crucial information that could prevent the company from entering blindly into <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risk.asp\">risky</a> businesses.\n", "\nA feasibility study is simply an assessment of the practicality of a proposed plan or project. As the name implies, these studies ask: Is this project feasible? Do we have the people, tools, technology, and resources necessary for this project to succeed?

As in the past, the community board had rejected similar types of development proposals. Finally, the college wondered if specific legal and political issues might impinge upon its plan.\n", "\nAll of these concerns and unknowns are apt reasons to proceed with a feasibility study, which the college finally did undertake. As a result, the school now is forging ahead with its expansion plans without needing to leave its historic home. If it had not taken the time and effort to conduct a feasibility study, the college would never have known whether its dreamed-of expansion could become a viable reality.\n"]}
