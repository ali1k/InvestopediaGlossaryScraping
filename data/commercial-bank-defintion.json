A commercial bank is where most people do their banking.\n", "\nCommercial banks make money by providing and earning interest from loans such as mortgages, auto loans, business loans, and personal loans. Customer deposits provide banks with the capital to make these loans.\n", "\nCommercial banks provide basic banking services to the general public\u2014to both individual consumers and small to mid-sized businesses. As mentioned above, these services include checking and savings accounts, loans and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortgage.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mortgages</a>, basic investment services such as CDs, as well as other services such as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/safe-deposit-box.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">safe deposit boxes</a>.\n", "\nBanks make money from service charges and fees. These fees vary based on the products, ranging from account fees (monthly maintenance charges, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/minimum-balance.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">minimum balance</a> fees, overdraft fees, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nsf.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">non-sufficient funds</a> (NSF) charges), safe deposit box fees, and late fees. Many loan products also contain fees in addition to interest charges. Banks also earn money from interest they earn by lending out money to other clients. The funds they lend comes from customer deposits. However, the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">interest rate</a> paid by the bank on the money they borrow is less than the rate charged on the money they lend. For instance, a bank may offer savings account customers an annual interest rate of 0.25%, while charging mortgage clients 5.75% in interest annually.\n", "\nCommercial banks have traditionally been located in buildings where customers come to use teller window services and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/atm.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">automated teller machines</a> (ATMs) to do their routine banking. With the rise in technology, most banks now allow their customers to do most of the same services <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/onlinebanking.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">online</a> that they could do in person including transfers, deposits, and bill payments. Many institutions are online-only banks. Because these banks don't have any <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brickandmortar.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">brick-and-mortar</a> locations, they can offer a wider range of products and services at a lower cost\u2014or none at all\u2014to their customers.\n", "\nCommercial banks are an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/062513/role-commercial-banks-economy.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">important part of the economy</a>. Not only do they provide consumers with an essential service, but they also help create <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">capital</a> and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">liquidity</a> in the market. This entails taking money that their customers deposit for their savings and lending it out to others. Commercial banks play a role in the creation of credit, which leads to an increase in production, employment, and consumer spending, thereby boosting the economy. As such, commercial banks are heavily regulated by central banks. For instance, central banks impose r<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/requiredreserves.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">eserve requirements</a> on commercial banks. This means banks are required to hold a certain percentage of their consumer deposits at the central bank as a cushion if there's a rush to withdraw funds by the general public.\n", "\nCustomers find commercial bank investments, such as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/savingsaccount.asp\">savings accounts</a> and CDs, attractive because they are insured by the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fdic.asp\">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</a> (FDIC), and money can be easily withdrawn. Customers have the option to withdraw money upon demand and the balances are fully insured up to $250,000, therefore, banks do not have to pay much for this money.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\"></span> Many banks pay no interest at all on checking account balances, or at least pay very little, and pay interest rates for savings accounts that are well below U.S. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurybond.asp\">Treasury bond</a> (T-bond) rates. However, these investments traditionally pay very low interest rates compared with <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutualfund.asp\">mutual funds</a> and other investment products. In some cases, commercial bank deposits, such as checking account deposits, pay no interest at all.\n", "\nConsumer lending makes up the bulk of North American bank lending, and of this, residential <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortgage.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mortgages</a> make up by far the largest share. Mortgages are used to buy properties and the homes themselves are often the security that <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/collateralization.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">collateralizes</a> the loan. Mortgages are typically written for 30 year repayment periods and interest rates may be fixed, adjustable, or variable. Although a variety of more exotic mortgage products were offered during the U.S. housing bubble of the 2000s, many of the riskier products, including pick-a-payment mortgages and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/negativelyamortizingloan.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">negative amortization loans</a>, are much less common now.\n", "\nAutomobile lending is another significant category of secured lending for many banks. Compared to mortgage lending, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/auto-loans-4689734\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">auto loans</a> are typically for shorter terms and higher rates. Banks face extensive competition in auto lending from other financial institutions, like captive auto financing operations run by automobile manufacturers and dealers.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditcard.asp\">Credit cards</a> are another significant lending type. Credit cards are, in essence, personal lines of credit that can be drawn down at any time. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/020215/visa-vs-mastercard-there-difference.asp\">Visa and MasterCard</a> run the proprietary networks through which money is moved around between the shopper's bank and the merchant's bank after a transaction. Not all banks engage in credit card lending and the rates of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/default2.asp\">default</a> are traditionally much higher than in mortgage lending or other types of secured lending. That said, credit card lending delivers lucrative <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fee.asp\">fees</a> for banks\u2014interchange fees charged to merchants for accepting the card and entering into the transaction, late-payment fees, currency exchange, over-the-limit, and other fees for the card user, as well as elevated rates on the balances that credit card users carry from one month to the next.\n", "\nBoth commercial and investment banks provide important services and play key roles in the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economy.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">economy</a>. These two branches of the banking industry were generally kept separate from one another, thanks to the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/glass_steagall_act.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Glass-Steagall Act of 1933</a>, which was passed during the Great Depression.

They act as financial intermediaries, providing their clients with underwriting services, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mergersandacquisitions.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">merger and acquisition</a> (M&amp;A) strategies, corporate reorganization services, and other types of brokerage services for institutional and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hnwi.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">high-net-worth individuals</a> (HNWIs).\n", "\nWhile commercial banking clients include individual consumers and small businesses, investment banking clients range from governments, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedgefund.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hedge funds</a>, other financial institutions, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing-strategy/090916/how-do-pension-funds-work.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pension funds</a>, and large companies.\n", "\nSome of the world's largest financial institutions are commercial banks or having commercial banking operations\u2014many of which can be found in the United States.

Commercial banks are what most people think of when they hear the term \"bank.\" Commercial banks accept deposits, make loans, safeguard assets, and work with many different types of clients, including the general public and businesses. If your account is with a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/what-is-a-community-bank-5069678\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">community bank</a> or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditunion.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">credit union</a>, it would probably not be a commercial bank.\n", "\nCommercial banks are crucial to the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fractionalreservebanking.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fractional reserve banking</a> system, currently found in most developed countries. This allows banks to extend new loans of up to (typically) 90% of the deposits they have on hand, theoretically growing the economy by freeing capital for lending.\n", "\nFor the most part, yes. Commercial banks are heavily regulated and most deposit accounts are covered up to $250,000 by FDIC insurance. Moreover, commercial banking and investment banking services cannot be commingled by law.\n"]}
