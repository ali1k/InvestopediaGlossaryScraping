The BCBS is a group of 45 representatives from major global financial centers.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff One of the goals of the BCBS was to mandate banks to hold a specific level of highly liquid assets and maintain certain levels of fiscal solvency to discourage them from lending high levels of\u00a0short-term debt.\n", "\nAs a result, banks are required to hold an amount of high-quality liquid assets that's enough to fund cash outflows for 30 days.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff Thirty days was chosen because it was believed that in a financial crisis, a response to rescue the financial system from governments and central banks would typically occur within 30 days.\n", "\nIn other words, the 30 day period allows banks to have a cushion of cash in the event of a run on banks during a financial crisis. The 30-day requirement under the LCR also provides central banks such as the Federal Reserve Bank time to step in and implement corrective measures to stabilize the financial system.\n", "\nThe LCR was proposed in 2010 with revisions and final approval in 2014. The full 100% minimum was not required until 2019.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff The liquidity coverage ratio applies to all banking institutions that\u00a0have more than $250 billion in total consolidated\u00a0assets or\u00a0more than $10 billion in on-balance sheet foreign exposure.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff Such banks, often referred to as \"Systematically Important Financial Institutions (SIFI),\" are required to maintain a 100% LCR, which means holding an amount of highly liquid assets that are equal or greater than its net cash flow, over a 30-day stress period. Highly liquid assets can include cash, Treasury bonds or corporate debt.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nThe high-quality liquid assets include only those with a high potential to be converted easily and quickly into cash. As stated earlier, the three categories of liquid assets with decreasing levels of quality are level 1, level 2A, and level 2B.\n", "\nUnder <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/basell-iii.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Basel III</a>, level 1 assets are not\u00a0discounted when calculating the LCR, while level 2A and level 2B assets have a 15% and a 25-50% discount, respectively. Level 1 assets include Federal Reserve bank balances, foreign\u00a0resources that can be withdrawn quickly, securities issued or guaranteed by specific sovereign entities, and U.S. government-issued or guaranteed securities.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"5\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nLevel 2A assets include securities issued or guaranteed by specific multilateral development banks or sovereign entities, and securities issued\u00a0by U.S. government-sponsored enterprises. Level 2B assets include publicly-traded common stock and investment-grade corporate debt securities issued by non-financial sector corporations.\n", "\nThe chief takeaway Basel III expects banks to glean from the formula is the expectation to achieve a leverage ratio in excess of 3%.\u00a0To conform to the requirement, the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalreservebank.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Federal Reserve Bank</a> of the United States fixed the leverage ratio at 5% for insured bank holding companies, and 6% for the aforementioned SIFIs. However, most banks will attempt to maintain a higher capital to cushion themselves from financial distress, even if it means issuing fewer loans to borrowers.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"6\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidityratios.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Liquidity ratios</a> are a class of financial metrics used to determine a company's ability to pay off current debt obligations without raising external capital. Liquidity ratios measure a company's ability to pay debt obligations and its margin of safety through the calculation of metrics including the\u00a0current ratio, quick ratio, and\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/ocfratio.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">operating cash flow ratio</a>. Current liabilities\u00a0are analyzed in relation to\u00a0liquid assets\u00a0to evaluate the coverage of short-term debts in an emergency.\n", "\nThe liquidity coverage ratio is the requirement whereby banks must hold an amount of high-quality liquid assets that's enough to fund cash outflows for 30 days.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff Liquidity ratios are similar to the LCR in that they measure a company's ability to meet its short-term financial obligations.\n", "\nA limitation of the LCR is that it requires banks to hold more cash and might lead to fewer loans issued to consumers and businesses.\u00a0\n", "\nOne could argue that if banks issue a fewer number of loans, it could lead to slower economic growth since companies that need access to debt to fund their operations and expansion would not have access to capital.\n", "\nOn the other hand, another limitation is that we won't know until the next financial crisis if the LCR provides enough of a financial cushion for banks or if it's insufficient to fund cash outflows for 30 days. The LCR is a stress test that aims to make sure that financial institutions have sufficient capital during short-term liquidity disruptions.\n", "\nFor example, let\u2019s assume bank ABC has\u00a0high-quality liquid assets worth $55 million and $35 million in anticipated net cash flows, over a 30-day stress period:\n"]}
