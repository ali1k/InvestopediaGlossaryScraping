In the years preceding the bubble, record low interest rates, the adoption of the Internet, and interest in technology companies allowed capital to flow freely, especially to startup companies that had no track record of success.

This led companies, many of which didn't even have a business plan or product, to collapse, causing the market to crash.\n", "\nThe dotcom crash was triggered by the rise and fall of technology stocks. The growth of the Internet created a buzz among investors, who were quick to pour money into startup companies.

These companies quickly ran through their cash, which caused them to go under.\n", "\nThe 2000 stock market crash was a direct result of the bursting of the dotcom bubble. It popped when a majority of the technology startups that raised money and went public folded when capital went dry.\n", "\nAmazon was one of the companies that survived the dotcom bubble, along with other major names like eBay and Priceline.\n"]}
