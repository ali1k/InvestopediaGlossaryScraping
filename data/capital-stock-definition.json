Capital stock can only be issued by the company and is the maximum number of shares that can ever be outstanding. The amount is listed on the balance sheet in the company's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholdersequity.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">shareholders' equity</a> section.\n", "\nCapital stock can be issued by a company to raise capital to grow its business.

Authorized shares are those that a company is legally able to issue\u2014the capital stock, while outstanding shares are those that have actually been issued and remain outstanding to shareholders.\n", "\nIssuing capital stock can allow a company to raise money without incurring a debt burden and the associated interest charges. The drawbacks are that the company would be relinquishing more of its equity and diluting the value of each outstanding share.\n", "\nThe amount that a company receives from issuing capital stock is considered to be capital contributions from investors and is reported as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/paidincapital.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">paid-in capital</a> and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/additionalpaidincapital.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">additional paid-in capital</a> in the stockholder's equity section of the balance sheet.\n", "\nThe common stock balance is calculated as the nominal or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/parvalue.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">par value</a> of the common stock multiplied by the number of common stock shares outstanding.

Those shares can be either common or preferred stock shares. A business can issue shares over time, so long as the total number of shares does not exceed the authorized amount. Authorizing a number of shares is an exercise that incurs legal cost, and authorizing a large number of shares that can be issued over time is a way to optimize this cost.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/preferredstock.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Preferred stock</a> is listed first in the shareholders' equity section of the balance sheet, because its owners receive dividends before the owners of common stock, and have preference during liquidation. Its par value is different from the common stock, and sometimes represents the initial selling price per share, which is used to calculate its dividend payments.\n", "\nTotal par value equals the number of preferred stock shares outstanding times the par value per share. For example, if a company has 1 million shares of preferred stock at $25 par value per share, it reports a par value of $25 million.\n"]}
