The HIBOR is a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/referencerate.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reference rate</a> for lenders and borrowers that participate directly or indirectly in the Asian economy. As of December 2020, plans were in place to transition away from HIBOR to the Hong Kong Overnight Index Average (HONIA).<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nThe banking industry uses an interbank market for transferring funds and currency, and for managing <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">liquidity</a>.\u00a0If a Hong Kong bank is nearing the point at which withdrawals are close to depleting short-term cash reserves, that bank will go into the Hong Kong interbank market and borrow money at the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR).\u00a0The terms of the loans vary from overnight to one year.\u00a0The U.K. version, the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/libor.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">London Interbank Offered Rate</a> (LIBOR), is similar to the\u00a0HIBOR.\u00a0\n", "\nThe rate is released each day at 11:00 a.m. local time. It is derived\u00a0from the contributed quotes of\u00a020 banks determined by the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB). The HKAB acts\u00a0similarly\u00a0to a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/centralbank.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">central bank</a> for Hong Kong. The highest three and the lowest three contributed values are discarded leaving the remaining 14 contributions in the calculation.\n", "\nHIBOR's primary function is to serve as the benchmark reference rate in the Asian markets for debt instruments. This function assists government and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corporatebond.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">corporate bonds</a>, mortgages, and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/derivative.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">derivatives</a>, such as currency and interest rate swaps, among many other financial products.\u00a0For example, an\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrateswap.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">interest rate swap</a>\u00a0involving two\u00a0counterparties\u00a0with good credit ratings, both of which have bonds issued in Hong Kong dollars, will likely be quoted in\u00a0HIBOR\u00a0plus a given percentage.\n", "\nIn another example, a Hong Kong dollar-denominated <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/frn.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">floating-rate note</a> (FRN), or floater, which pays coupons based on HIBOR plus a margin of 35 basis points (0.35%) annually. In this case, the HIBOR rate used is the one-year HIBOR plus a 35 basis point spread. Every year, the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coupon-rate.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">coupon rate</a> is reset to match the current Honk Kong dollar one-year HIBOR, plus the predetermined spread.\n", "\nIf, for instance, the one-year HIBOR is 4% at the start of the year, the bond will return 4.35% of its <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/parvalue.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">par value</a> at\u00a0year's end.

Even LIBOR, which is a global benchmark, is under fire, especially since the 2012 LIBOR fixing scandal. As of December 2020, plans were in place to phase out the LIBOR system by 2023 and replace it with other benchmarks, such as the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sonia.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sterling Overnight Index Average</a> (SONIA).<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff SONIA is based on actual bids and offers from the contributing banks and not indicated levels. The latter are subject to manipulation if the contributing bank wants to hide or enhance its capital position.\n", "\nIndeed, in 2013, the HIBOR market had its scandal when the city widened its investigation into possible manipulation of this key interest rate. The HIBOR fixing mechanism was eventually ruled to be sound, but with similar problems surfacing in other <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interbankmarket.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">interbank markets</a>, the trend towards finding replacements is moving forward.\n", "\nThe replacement push centers on LIBOR since it is the globally recognized standard.
