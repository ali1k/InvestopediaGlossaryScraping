To understand how it works, it is first necessary to get to the bottom of what each of them mean.\n", "\nThe run rate is a method for forecasting the future <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financialperformance.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">financial performance</a> of a company based on past data.\u00a0Let\u2019s say a company records <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/revenue.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">revenue</a> of $100 million in its last quarter. Using this information as a predictor of future performance, we could say that it is expected to register sales of $400 million for the year\u2014or is operating at a $400 million run rate.\u00a0\n", "\nThen there\u2019s owner earnings: a valuation method favored by investment guru Warren Buffett. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/netincome.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Net income</a> (NI) gets a lot of attention from investors, yet does not always fully reflect the actual dollar amount that a business has in its coffers to distribute to owners and boost <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholder-value.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">shareholder value</a>.\n", "\nThat\u2019s what owner earnings sets out to achieve. Buffett stated that the value of a company is simply the total of the net cash flows (owner earnings)\u00a0expected to occur over the life of the business, minus any reinvestment of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earnings.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">earnings</a>. In a 1986 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholder Letter, Buffett gave some insight into owner earnings and how it should be calculated:<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff\n", "\nIn other words, owner earnings = reported earnings + <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/06/amortizationvsdepreciation.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">depreciation, amortization</a> +/- other non-cash charges \u2013 average annual\u00a0maintenance capex +/-\u00a0changes in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/workingcapital.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">working capital</a>. What the resulting figure aims to tell us is the amount of value the company is creating and how much is flowing back to shareholders. Often, it ends up similar to free cash flow (FCF): the cash\u00a0a company generates after accounting for cash outflows to support operations and maintain its\u00a0capital assets.\u00a0\n", "\nOwner earnings is an important metric that investors can use to gauge a company\u2019s <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-health.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">financial health</a>. Increased owner earnings tend to act as a signal that a company's subsequent earnings will be good. Therefore, assessing an accurate owner earnings run rate could be very important in predicting the company's longer-term performance.\n", "\nThe problem is that the owner earnings run rate is not always reliable, namely because it takes for granted\u00a0that the company\u2019s financial performance stays consistent throughout the period. For example, let\u2019s say that after three <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quarter.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">quarters</a> a company posts owner earnings of $9 million. Assuming that performance stays consistent, the company's owner earnings run rate for the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiscalyear.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fiscal year</a> (FY) would be $12 million ($3 million per quarter).\n", "\nThis estimate can be difficult to assess if the company is operating in an industry that experiences <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/seasonality.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">seasonality</a>. In such cases, owner earnings from one period may not be applicable across the entire time period.\n", "\nRun rates do not account for higher sales linked to a new product release, a common occurrence among many technology firms, or large, one-time sales, either.\u00a0\n"]}
