It is also usually the most expensive form of a bankruptcy proceeding. For these reasons, a company must consider Chapter 11 reorganization only after careful analysis and exploration of all other possible alternatives.\n", "\nDuring a Chapter 11 proceeding, the court will help a business restructure its debts and obligations. In most cases the firm remains open and operating. Many large U.S. companies file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and stay afloat. Such businesses include automobile giant General Motors, the airline United Airlines, retail outlet K-mart, and thousands of other corporations of all sizes. Corporations, partnerships, and limited liability companies (LLCs) usually file Chapter 11, but in rare cases <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/061815/what-are-differences-between-chapter-11-and-chapter-13-bankruptcy.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">individuals with a lot of debt who do not qualify for Chapter 7 or 13 may be eligible for Chapter 11</a>.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"8\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"9\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff However, the process is not a speedy one.\n", "\nA business in the midst of filing Chapter 11 may continue to operate.

These include the sale of assets, other than inventory, starting or terminating a rental agreement, and stopping or expanding business operations. The court also has control over decisions related to retaining and paying attorneys and entering contracts with vendors and unions. Finally, the debtor cannot arrange a loan that will commence after the bankruptcy is complete.\n", "\nIn Chapter 11 the individual or business filing bankruptcy has the first chance to propose a reorganization plan. These plans may include downsizing of business operations to reduce expenses, as well as renegotiating of debts.
