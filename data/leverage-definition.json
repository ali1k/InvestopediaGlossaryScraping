Leverage is an investment strategy of using borrowed money\u2014specifically, the use of various financial instruments or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/borrowed-capital.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">borrowed capital</a>\u2014to increase the potential return of an investment. Leverage can also refer to the amount of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debt.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">debt</a> a firm uses to finance assets.\n", "\nLeverage is the use of debt (borrowed capital) in order to undertake an investment or project. The result is to multiply the potential returns from a project. At the same time, leverage will also multiply the potential <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/downsiderisk.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">downside risk</a> in case the investment does not pan out. When one refers to a company, property, or\u00a0investment\u00a0as \"highly leveraged,\" it means that item has more debt than equity.\n", "\nThe concept of leverage is used by both investors and companies. Investors use leverage to significantly increase the returns that can be provided on an investment.\u00a0They lever their investments by using various instruments, including <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">options</a>, futures,\u00a0and margin accounts. Companies can use leverage to finance their assets. In other words, instead of issuing stock to raise capital, companies can use debt financing to invest in business operations in an attempt to increase shareholder value.\u00a0\n", "\nInvestors who are not comfortable using leverage directly have a variety of ways to access leverage indirectly. They can invest in companies that use leverage in the normal course of their business to finance or expand operations\u2014without increasing\u00a0their outlay.\n", "\nThrough balance sheet analysis, investors can study the debt and equity on the books of various firms and can invest in companies that put leverage to work on behalf of their businesses. Statistics such as\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnonequity.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">return on equity</a> (ROE), debt to equity (D/E), and\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/roce.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">return on capital employed</a> (ROCE) help investors determine how companies\u00a0deploy\u00a0capital and how much of that capital companies have\u00a0borrowed.\n", "\nTo properly evaluate these statistics, it is important to keep in mind that leverage comes in several varieties, including operating, financial, and combined leverage.\n", "\nFundamental analysis uses the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/degreeofoperatingleverage.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">degree of operating leverage</a>. One can calculate the degree of operating leverage\u00a0by dividing the percentage change of a company's earnings per share (EPS)\u00a0by its percentage change in its <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebit.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">earnings before interest and taxes</a> (EBIT) over a period.\n", "\nSimilarly, one could calculate the degree of operating leverage by dividing a company's EBIT by EBIT less interest expense. A higher degree of operating leverage\u00a0shows a higher level of volatility in a company's EPS.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dupontanalysis.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DuPont analysis</a> uses the \"equity multiplier\" to measure financial leverage. One can calculate the equity multiplier by dividing a firm's total assets by its total equity. Once figured, one multiplies\u00a0the financial leverage\u00a0with the total asset turnover and the profit margin to produce the return on equity. For example, if a publicly-traded company has total assets valued at $500 million and shareholder equity valued at $250 million, then the equity multiplier is 2.0 ($500 million / $250 million). This shows the company has financed\u00a0half its\u00a0total assets by equity. Hence, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042115/which-better-high-or-low-equity-multiplier.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">larger equity multipliers</a> suggest more financial leverage.\n", "\nIf reading spreadsheets and conducting fundamental analysis is not your cup of tea, you can purchase mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that use leverage. By using these vehicles, you can delegate the research and investment decisions to experts.\n", "\nAlthough interconnected\u2014since both involve borrowing\u2014leverage and margin are not the same. Leverage refers to\u00a0taking on debt, while\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margin.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">margin</a> is debt or borrowed money a firm uses\u00a0to invest in other financial instruments.\n", "\nA margin account allows you to borrow money from a broker for a fixed interest rate to purchase securities, options, or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futures.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">futures</a> contracts in the anticipation of receiving substantially high returns. You can use margin to create leverage.\n", "\nLeverage is a multi-faceted,\u00a0complex tool. The theory sounds great, and in reality, the use of leverage can be profitable, but the reverse is also true. Leverage magnifies both gains <em>and </em>losses. If an investor uses leverage to make an investment and the investment moves against the investor, their loss is much greater than it would've been if they have not leveraged the investment.\n", "\nFor this reason, leverage should often be <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/11/dangerous-moves-first-time-investors.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">avoided by first-time investors</a> until they get more experience under their belts. In the business world, a company can use leverage to generate shareholder wealth, but if it fails to do so, the interest expense and credit risk of default destroy <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholder-value.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">shareholder value</a>.\n", "\nA company was formed with a $5 million investment from investors, where the equity in the company is $5 million\u2014this is the money the company can use to operate. If the company uses <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtfinancing.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">debt financing</a> by borrowing $20 million, it now has $25 million to invest in business operations and more opportunity to increase value for shareholders.\n", "\nAn automaker, for example, could borrow money to build a new factory. The new factory would enable the automaker to increase the number of cars it produces and increase\u00a0profits.\n"]}
