However, this kind of policy is thought to be inherently limited during periods when the Fed\u2019s target rate is at or near zero. In these cases, instead of targeting interest rates, the Fed can target specific quantities of reserves to issue (and assets to buy) with the aim of flooding the financial system with <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">liquidity</a> to ease credit conditions, regardless of the zero percent lower bound on rates.\u00a0\n", "\nUsing the Fed's balance sheet through QE was at first somewhat controversial.

The central bank can almost instantaneously expand its balance sheet by electronically \u201cprinting\u201d money and crediting it to the reserve accounts of primary dealers and borrowers from the Fed.\n", "\nIn the process, the Fed simultaneously uses this money to buy assets, such as U.S. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurynote.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Treasury notes</a> (T-notes).
