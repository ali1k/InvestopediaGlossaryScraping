Mathematically and statistically based actuarial life tables assist insurance companies by showing event probabilities, such as death, sickness, and disability.\n", "\nAn actuarial life table can also include factors to differentiate variable risks such as smoking, occupation, socio-economic status, and even gambling, and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debt-load.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">debt load</a>. Computerized predictive modeling allows actuaries the ability to calculate for a wide variety of circumstances and probable outcomes.\n", "\nActuarial science uses primarily\u00a0two types of life tables. First, the\u00a0period life table is used to determine\u00a0mortality rates for\u00a0a specific time period of a certain population. The other type of actuarial life table is called the\u00a0cohort life table, also referred to as a generation life table. It\u00a0is used to represent the overall mortality rates of a certain population's entire lifetime.\n", "\nThe population selection must be born during the same specific time interval. A\u00a0cohort\u00a0life table is more commonly\u00a0used because it attempts to predict\u00a0any expected change\u00a0in mortality rates of a population in the future.\n", "\nA cohort\u00a0table also analyzes observable mortality patterns\u00a0over time.\u00a0Both\u00a0types of actuarial life tables are\u00a0based on\u00a0actual populations of\u00a0the present and\u00a0educated predictions of\u00a0a population's\u00a0near future.\u00a0Other types of life tables may be based on historical records. These types of life tables\u00a0often undercount infants and understate infant mortality.\n", "\nInsurance companies use actuarial life tables to primarily make two types of predictions: the\u00a0probability\u00a0of surviving any particular year of age and the remaining\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lifeexpectancy.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">life expectancy</a>\u00a0for people of different ages.\n", "\nActuarial life tables also play an important role in the sciences of\u00a0biology\u00a0and\u00a0epidemiology. In addition, the Social Security Administration in the United States uses actuarial life tables to\u00a0examine\u00a0the mortality rates of\u00a0people who have Social Security in order to inform certain policy decisions\u00a0or\u00a0actions.\u00a0\n", "\nActuarial life tables are also important\u00a0in\u00a0product life cycle management and for pension calculations.\n"]}
