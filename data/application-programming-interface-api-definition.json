In the context of trading, a trader will often use an API to establish a connection between a set of automated trading algorithms and the trader's preferred trading broker platform for the purpose of obtaining real-time\u00a0pricing data and place trades.\n", "\nApplication programming interfaces, or APIs, have become increasingly popular with the rise of automated <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/programtrading.asp\">trading systems</a>. In the past, retail traders were forced to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockscreener.asp\">screen</a> for opportunities in one application and separately\u00a0place trades with their broker. Many retail brokers now provide APIs that enable traders to directly connect their screening software with the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brokerageaccount.asp\">brokerage account</a> to share real-time prices and place orders. Traders can even develop their own applications, using programming languages like Python, and execute trades using a broker's\u00a0API.\n", "\nThere are two types of traders that use broker APIs:\n", "\nDespite the obvious benefits of APIs, there are many risks to consider. Most APIs are provided to a broker's customers free-of-charge, but there are some cases where traders may incur an extra fee. It's important to understand these fees before using the API. Traders should also be aware of any API limitations, including the potential for downtime, which could have a significant effect on trading results.\n", "\nThe most popular brokers supporting API access in the traditional stock and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futuresmarket.asp\">futures markets</a>include TradeStation, TDAmeritrade, and InteractiveBrokers, but many smaller brokers have expanded access over time. APIs are more common among forex brokers\u00a0where third-party applications and trading systems - such as MetaTrader\u00a0- have been commonly used for many years.\n", "\nMany brokers provide online documentation for their APIs, where developers can find out exactly how to authenticate with the API, what data is available for consumption, how to place orders through the API, and other technical details. It's important to be familiar\u00a0with these details before choosing a broker when\u00a0looking for specific functionality.\n", "\nSome brokers also provide libraries in various languages to make interaction\u00a0with their API easier. For example, a broker may offer a Python library that provides a set of functions, or methods, for placing a trade rather than having to write your own functions to do so. This can help accelerate development of trading systems and/or make them less costly to develop.\n"]}
