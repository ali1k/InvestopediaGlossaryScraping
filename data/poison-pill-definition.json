Potential targets use this tactic in order to make them look less attractive to the potential acquirer. Although they're not always the first\u2014and best\u2014way to defend a company, poison pills are generally very effective.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/takeover.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Takeovers</a> are fairly common in the business world, where one company makes an offer to assume control over another. Larger companies tend to take over smaller ones if they want to get into a new market, when there are <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operationalefficiency.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">operational benefits</a> by combining both entities, or when the acquirer wants to eliminate the competition. Takeovers, though, aren't always harmonious and become hostile when the target doesn't entertain or want to be taken over.\n", "\nWhen a company becomes the target of a hostile takeover, it may use the poison pill strategy to make itself less attractive to the potential <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/acquirer.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">acquirer</a>. As the name indicates, a poison pill is analogous to something that's difficult to swallow or accept. A company targeted for an unwanted takeover may use a poison pill to make its <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shares.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">shares</a> unfavorable to the acquiring firm or individual.\n", "\nPoison pills also significantly raise the cost of acquisitions and create big disincentives to deter such attempts completely.\n", "\nThe mechanism protects minority <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholder.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">shareholders</a> and avoids the change of control of company management. Implementing a poison pill may not always indicate that the company is not willing to be acquired. At times, it may be enacted\u00a0to get a higher valuation or more favorable terms for the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/acquisition.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">acquisition</a>.\n", "\nSince shareholders\u2014who are the actual owners of a company\u2014can vote by majority to favor the acquisition, the target company management deploys a poison pill, which is usually a\u00a0specially designed <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042015/why-shareholder-rights-plan-called-poison-pill.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">shareholder rights plan</a> with certain conditions drafted specifically to thwart attempted takeovers.\n", "\nThe poison pill tactic has been around since the 1980s and was devised by New York-based legal firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen, and Katz. The name comes from the poison pill spies carried in the past to avoid being questioned by their enemies in the event they were captured. It was designed as a way to prevent an acquiring company from buying a majority share in the potential target or from negotiating with shareholders directly at a time when takeovers were becoming very frequent and common.\n", "\nThere are two types of poison pill strategies\u2014the flip-in and flip-over. Of the two types, the flip-in variety is more commonly followed.\n", "\nA <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/flip-in-poison-pill.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">flip-in poison pill</a> strategy involves allowing the shareholders, except for the acquirer, to purchase additional shares at a discount. Though purchasing additional shares provides shareholders with instantaneous <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profit.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">profits</a>, the practice\u00a0dilutes the value of the limited number of shares already purchased by the acquiring company. This right to purchase is given to the shareholders before the takeover is finalized and is often triggered when the acquirer amasses a certain threshold percentage of shares of the target company.\n", "\nHere's an example. Let's say a flip-in poison pill plan is triggered when the acquirer purchases 30% of the target company\u2019s shares. Once triggered, every shareholder\u2014excluding the acquirer\u2014is entitled to buy new shares at a discounted rate. The greater the number of shareholders who buy additional shares, the more diluted the acquiring company's interest becomes. This makes the cost of the bid much higher.\n", "\nAs new shares make way to the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">market</a>, the value of shares held by the acquirer reduces, thereby making the takeover attempt more expensive and more difficult. If a bidder is aware that such a plan could be activated, they may be inclined not to pursue a takeover. Such\u00a0provisions of a flip-in are often publicly available in a company's bylaws, or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/charter.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">charter</a>, and indicate their potential use as a takeover defense.\n", "\nA flip-over poison pill strategy allows stockholders of the target company to purchase the shares of the acquiring company at a deeply discounted price if the\u00a0hostile takeover attempt is successful. For example, a target company\u00a0shareholder may gain the right to buy the stock of its acquirer at a two-for-one rate, thereby\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dilution.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">diluting</a> the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equity.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">equity</a> in the acquiring company.
