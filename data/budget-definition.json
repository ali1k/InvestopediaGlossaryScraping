A static budget evaluates the effectiveness of the original budgeting process, while a flexible budget provides deeper insight into business operations.\n", "\nIndividuals and families can have budgets, too. Creating and using a budget is not just for those who need to closely monitor their cash flows from month to month because \"money is tight.\"\u00a0Almost everyone\u2014even people with large paychecks and plenty of money in the bank\u2014can benefit from budgeting.\n", "\nBudgeting is a wonderful tool for managing your finances, but many people think it's not for them.

Set up an automatic transfer from your <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/checkingaccount.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">checking account</a> to a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/savingsaccount.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">savings account</a> you won't see (i.e., at a different bank), scheduled to happen right after you get paid.\n", "\nIf you are saving for retirement, you may have the option of contributing a set amount regularly to a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/401kplan.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">401(k) </a>or other retirement savings plan. This way, you can pay yourself first, have enough money for the transfer, and pay yourself the same predetermined amount that you know will help you meet your savings goals.\u00a0\n", "\nIn general, traditional budgeting starts with tracking expenses, eliminating debt, and once the budget is balanced, building an emergency fund. But to speed up the process, you could start by building a partial emergency fund. This emergency fund acts as a buffer as the rest of the budget is put in place and should replace the use of credit cards for emergency situations.\n", "\nThe key is to build the fund at regular intervals, consistently devoting a certain percentage of each paycheck toward it, and if possible, putting in whatever you can spare on top. This will get you to think about your spending, too.\n", "\nYou should only use the emergency money for true emergencies: like when you drive to work but your muffler stays at home, your water heater dies, or a leak springs in your roof.\n", "\nYou would save money if you used your emergency fund to eliminate <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-card-debt.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">credit card debt</a>, but the purpose of the fund is to prevent you from having to use your credit card for paying for unexpected expenses. With a proper emergency fund, you will not need your credit card to keep you afloat when something goes wrong.\n", "\nNow that you have a buffer between you and high-interest debt, it is time to start the process of downsizing. The more space you can create between your expenses and your income, the more income you will have to pay down debt and invest.\n", "\nThis can be a process of substitution as much as elimination. For example, if you have a monthly\u00a0gym membership, cancel it.\u00a0Use half of the money you save to invest or pay off outstanding debts, and save the other half to begin building a home gym in your basement. Instead of buying coffee from a fancy coffee shop every day, invest in a coffee maker with a grinder and make your own, saving more money over the long term.\n", "\nAlthough eliminating expenses entirely is the fastest way to a solid budget, substitution tends to have more lasting effects. People often cut too deep and end up making a budget that they can't keep because it feels like they are giving up everything. Substitution, in contrast, keeps the basics while cutting down the costs.\n", "\nWhy isn't this the first step? If you simply increase your income without a budget to handle the extra cash properly, the gains tend to slip through the cracks and vanish. Once you have your budget in place and have more money coming in than going out (along with the buffer of an emergency fund), you can start investing to create more income.\n", "\nIt is better to have no debt before you begin investing. If you are young, however, the rewards of investing in\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutualfund.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">higher-risk, high-return</a> vehicles like stocks can outweigh most low-interest debt over time.\n", "\nNow you understand the finer points of budgeting. You've accomplished all of the above, even put together a nice spreadsheet that lays out your budget for the next 15 years. The only problem is that sticking to that budget isn't as easy you thought. That credit card still calls your name, and your \"clothes\" category seems awfully small and you feel deprived. Budgets, you decide, are no fun.\n", "\nThe good news is you don't have to throw it all out the window just because you've messed up once or twice.\n", "\nThe point of the budget is to keep you out of overwhelming debt and help you build a financial future that will give you <em>more</em> freedom, not less. So think about how you want your future to be and remember that keeping to your budget will help you get there. Adding to your debt load, on the other hand, will mean that your future could be even tighter.\n", "\nMake it more difficult on yourself to make impulse purchases; in other words, set up barriers so you have time to stop and think: \"Is this purchase necessary?\" Take yourself off retailer email lists.\u00a0Remove your stored payment information on your favorite online shops so you can't just click to order.\n", "\nIf you feel like you're the only one in your group who is on a budget, search and find some like-minded folks. It could be an online forum, a monthly meeting, or even just a couple of friends traveling the same budgetary road. You need to know you're not the only person setting sane financial limits for yourself. You can also have accountability with your frugal buddies, talking things over and each other out of temptation.\n", "\nThere's something powerful about handing over a stack of $20\u00a0bills for purchase:\u00a0It causes you to really think about the amount of money you're about to spend. Swiping a debit card, on the other hand, may not feel nearly as real.\u00a0Similarly, paying bills by writing checks and promptly entering the sums into your register keeps you up-to-date on how your account is\u00a0affected\u00a0in a way that autopay doesn't.\n", "\nYou don't have to use cash exclusively or completely forgo online payments,\u00a0but handling transactions in old-fashioned ways can make you realize how much you're spending and enhance the power of self-regulation.\n", "\nIf you are constantly looking at what you have to cut and give up, the very act of budgeting will become distasteful. A mixture of long-\u00a0and short-term gifts to yourself will help keep you motivated. When you've been faithful to your budget for a month, give yourself a reward. Even small ones can help, such as\u00a0a night out with friends, a concert or\u00a0a little extra cash for spending. Keep visual reminders of these rewards\u00a0or the things you're saving up for. Start building associations in your brain\u2014that sticking to your budget has a pleasurable result.\n", "\nIt's difficult to predict how much money you'll need in every category of life; a new job may necessitate a wardrobe change and your clothing budget may not cut it. That's why it's important to have a regular check on how you've created your budget. If it isn't working, tweak it. It is <em>your</em> budget, after all\u2014just make sure you keep your long-term financial goals in the picture.\n", "\nInstead of taking the more common road of instant gratification, which leads so easily to overspending and endless debt, learn all you can about finances, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/moneymanagement.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">money management</a>,\u00a0and how you can best invest in yourself. Talk to your financially savvy friends and\u00a0get real-world tips and advice from people who are doing well with their money.\n", "\nThe more you learn about handling money wisely and its rewards, the more concrete the reasons for budgeting will be, and the better you will be at not only creating a budget that works for you, but also sticking to it.\n", "\nBudgeting strategies sound fine, but if you're in dire straits financially or\u00a0suffering from mounting bills and a lack of funds, there are some other possible steps to take.\n", "\nDon't be afraid to request bill extensions or payment plans from creditors. Skipping or delaying payments only worsens your debt\u2014and besides, late fees ding your credit score.\u00a0\n", "\nGo over all your bills to see what must be paid first and then set up a payment schedule based on your paydays. You will want to leave yourself some catch-up time if some of your bills are already late.\n", "\nIf this is the case, call the bill companies to see how much you can pay now to get back on track toward positive status. Tell them you are taking strict measures to catch up. Be honest about the amount you can afford to pay; don't just promise to pay the full amount later.\n", "\nStashing 10% of your income into your savings account is daunting when you're living paycheck to paycheck. It doesn't make sense to have $100 in a savings plan if you are fending off debt collectors. Your piggy bank will have to starve until you can find financial stability.\n", "\nTo fix your finances, you need to get a handle on your outlay first. Online banking and online budgeting software can help you categorize spending so you can make adjustments. Many people find that just by looking at aggregate figures for <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/discretionary-expense.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">discretionary expenses</a>, they are spurred to change their patterns and reduce excessive spending.\n", "\nOnce you've got a sense of where the money goes, it's time to tighten up. All cutbacks should start with items you wouldn't miss or habits you should change anyway\u2014like reducing your fresh food purchases if you find ingredients spoiling before you can eat them. Or preparing meals at home more instead of going to restaurants or getting takeout.\n", "\nSome expenses you shouldn't drop but might be able to adjust could include reducing your auto insurance rate by switching carriers.\n", "\nThere are other proactive ways to reduce expenses. Those killer interest rates on your credit cards aren't fixed in stone, for example. Call the card company\u00a0and ask for a reduction in the annual\u00a0percentage rates (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/apr.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">APR</a>); if you have a good record, your request might be approved. This won't lower your outstanding balance, but it will keep it from mushrooming as fast.\n", "\nOnce you've gone through these steps, monitor your progress for a few months. You can do this by writing everything you spend in a notebook, via budgeting apps on your phone, or with that software you used in step 4 to review your spending.\n", "\nHow you track your money isn't as important as how much you are tracking. Focus on ensuring that every cent is accounted for by dividing your expenses into categories. Fine-tune and adjust the spending as needed after each month.\n", "\nFor the time being, saving and investing money is out. But consider ways to increase earnings: working overtime, getting a second job, or picking up some freelance work.\n", "\nA budget isn't a prison cell to keep you away from your money. Rather, it's a tool you use to make sure your future is better\u2014and yes, richer, than your present.\n"]}
