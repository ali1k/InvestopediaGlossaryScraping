Providing these details makes it easier to compare different credit cards.\n", "\nTILA permits the interest owed on credit card balances to be calculated in various different ways.<em> </em>The most common methods are:\n", "\nThe average daily balance totals each day's balance for the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/billing-cycle.asp\">billing cycle</a> and divides by the total number of days in the billing cycle. Then, the balance is multiplied by the monthly interest rate to assess the customer's finance charge\u2014dividing the cardholder's APR by 12 calculates the monthly interest rate.\u00a0However, if the lender or card issuer uses a method that compounds interest daily, the interest associated with the day's ending balance gets added to the next day's beginning balance. This will result in higher interest charges and the reader should confirm which method is being used.\n", "\nThe average daily balance credits a customer\u2019s account from the day the credit card company receives a payment. To assess the balance due, the credit card issuer sums the beginning balance for each day in the billing period and subtracts any payments as they arrive and any credits made to the customer\u2019s account that day.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashadvance.asp\">Cash advances</a>\u00a0are usually included in the average daily balance. The total balance due may fluctuate daily because of payments and purchases.\n", "\nA credit card has a monthly interest rate of 1.5 percent, and the previous balance is $500. On the 15th day of a billing cycle, the credit card company receives and credits a customer\u2019s payment of $300. On the 18th day, the customer makes a $100 purchase.\n", "\nThe average daily balance is ((14 x 500) + (3 x 200) + (13 x 300)) / 30 = (7,000 + 600 + 3,900) / 30 = 383.33. The bigger the payment a customer pays and the earlier in the billing cycle the customer makes a payment, the lower the finance charges assessed. The denominator, 30 in this example, will vary based on the number of days in the billing cycle for a given month.\n", "\nInterest charges using the average daily balance method<em> </em>should be lower than the<em> </em>previous balance method<em>, </em>which<em> </em>charges interest based on the amount of debt carried over from the previous\u00a0billing cycle\u00a0to the new billing cycle.\u00a0On the other hand, the average daily balance method will likely incur higher interest charges than the adjusted balance method because the latter bases finance charges on the current billing period\u2019s ending balance.\n", "\nCard issuers use the adjusted balance method much less frequently than either the average daily balance method or the previous balance method.\n", "\nSome credit card companies previously used the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/double-cycle-billing.asp\">double-cycle billing</a>\u00a0method, assessing a customer\u2019s average daily balance over the last two billing cycles.\n", "\nDouble-cycle billing can add a significant amount of interest charges to customers whose average balance varies greatly from month to month.\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-card-accountability-responsibility-and-disclosure-act-of-2009.asp\">The Credit CARD Act of 2009</a> banned double-cycle billing on credit cards.\n"]}
