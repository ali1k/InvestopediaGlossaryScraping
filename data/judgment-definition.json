A judgment, paid or unpaid, will remain on the debtor's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditreport.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">credit report</a> for seven years, but it will have a worse effect on their <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit_score.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">credit score</a> if it is unpaid.\n", "\nFor the winner of a lawsuit, a court judgment is only the first step in getting the money they are owed.

However, judgments are legally enforceable. So, if the debtor does not voluntarily pay the judgment, the creditor can take steps such as conducting a debtor's examination, seizing bank accounts, putting a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lien.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lien</a> on the debtor's property, or hiring a debt collector.\n", "\nFor example, if a borrower does not repay a loan or a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-card-debt.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">credit card debt</a>, the lender or creditor can obtain a judgment to force the borrower to pay. As another example, a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/landlord.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">landlord</a> who evicted a tenant for not paying the rent might file a lawsuit to collect the unpaid rent, and if the landlord won the lawsuit, it would result in a judgment against the tenant.\n"]}
