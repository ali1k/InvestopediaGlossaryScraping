The acronym is an easy shorthand method of referring to all three continents at once and is especially popular among North American companies.\n", "\nEurope, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) is a label that many global firms use when dividing their operations by geography. A multinational might, for example, break out its financial results by region, reporting sales and profits in the Americas, the\u00a0EMEA region, and Asia Pacific and Japan. It might also assign leadership roles based on these divisions. Microsoft Corp.

It may or may not include Russia (shown below) or Kazakhstan (not shown), for example. European overseas territories on other continents are generally excluded (though French Guiana is shown below). Since few firms have operations in anything close to every country that might be considered EMEA, the list of nations comprising\u00a0an individual firm's EMEA\u00a0region will be idiosyncratic.\u00a0\n", "\nBesides being widely recognized, the EMEA\u00a0is useful for operational purposes because most of the region\u2014Russia's far east excluded\u2014falls within four <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/08/forex-trading-schedule-trading-times.asp\">time zones</a>, facilitating communication and travel.\u00a0\n", "\nOther than longitude, however, little unites the EMEA\u00a0region. It contains incredible political, economic, linguistic, cultural, religious and climatic diversity. Some of the world's richest countries are lumped in with some of the poorest. Political systems range from stable democracies to autocracies to failed states. Regions, where the lingua franca is Swahili, are lumped in with ones where it is Arabic, French, Russian, or English. Local languages number in the hundreds.\u00a0\n", "\nEMEA, in other words,\u00a0is a creature of corporate boardrooms, not an intuitive designation with its roots in history, culture, or politics.\n", "\nSometimes India is included in the grouping, making the acronym EMEIA or sometimes EMIA. Companies may sometimes separate their business operations in Eastern and Western Europe, referring instead to Eastern Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EEMEA) and the European Union (EU) or European Free Trade Association (EFTA). Other similar acronyms include:\n", "\nLike EMEA, these regional groupings are based on geographical closeness, rather than cultural, linguistic, historical, or political similarities. Typically, nations are grouped together based on what is most convenient for the multinational corporation making the designation.\n"]}
