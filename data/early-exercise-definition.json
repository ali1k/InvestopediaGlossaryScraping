For put options it is the converse: the options holder may demand that the options seller buy shares of the underlying stock at the strike price.\n", "\nEarly exercise is only possible with <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/americanoption.asp\">American-style option</a> contracts, which the holder may <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exercise.asp\">exercise</a> at any time up to expiration.

Traders will take profits by selling their options and closing the trade. Their goal is to realize a profit from the difference between the selling price and their original option purchase price.\u00a0\n", "\nFor a long <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp\">call</a> or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/putoption.asp\">put</a>, the owner\u00a0closes a trade by selling, rather than exercising the option. This\u00a0trade often results in more profit due to the amount of\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/timevalue.asp\">time value</a> remaining in the long option lifespan.

Also, any purchased shares must still follow the vesting schedule of the company's plan.\n", "\nThe money outlay of early exercise within a company plan is the same as waiting until after vesting, ignoring the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/timevalueofmoney.asp\">time value of money</a>. However, since the payment is shifted to the present, it may be possible to avoid short-term taxation and the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/alternativeminimumtax.asp\">alternative minimum tax</a>\u00a0(AMT).

They vest after two years.\n", "\nThe employee exercises 5,000 of those options to purchase ABC's stock, which is valued at $15, after a year. Exercising those options will cost $7,000 based on a federal AMT rate of 28%. However, the employee can reduce the federal tax percentage by holding onto the exercised options for another year to meet requirements for long-term <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital_gains_tax.asp\">capital gains tax</a>.\n"]}
