The purpose of the inflation-adjusted return metric is to reveal the return on an investment after removing the effects of inflation.\n", "\nRemoving the effects of inflation from the return of an investment allows the investor to see the true <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earning-potential.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">earning potential</a> of the security without external economic forces. The inflation-adjusted return is also known as the real rate of return.\n", "\nThe inflation-adjusted return is useful for comparing investments, especially between different countries because each country's inflation rate is accounted for in the return. In this scenario, without adjusting for inflation across international borders, an investor may get vastly different results when analyzing an investment's performance. The Inflation-adjusted return serves as a more realistic measure of an investment's return when compared to other investments.\n", "\nFor example, assume a bond investment is reported to have earned 2%\u00a0in the previous year. This appears like a gain. However, suppose that inflation last year was 2.5%. Essentially, this means the investment did not keep up with inflation, and it effectively lost 0.5%.\n", "\nAssume also a stock that returned 12% last year and inflation was 3%. An approximate estimate of the real rate of return is 9%, or the 12%\u00a0reported return less the inflation amount (3%).\n", "\nCalculating the inflation-adjusted return requires three basic steps. First, the return on the investment must be calculated. Second, the inflation for the period must be calculated. And third, the inflation amount must be geometrically backed out of the investment's return.\n", "\nAssume an investor purchases a stock on January 1 of a given year for $75,000. At the end of the year, on December 31, the investor sells the stock for $90,000. During the course of the year, the investor received $2,500 in dividends. At the beginning of the year, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) was at 700. On December 31, the CPI was at a level of 721.\n", "\nThe first step is to calculate the investment's return using the following formula:\n", "\nThe second step is to calculate the level of inflation over the period using the following formula:\n", "\nThe third step is to geometrically back out the inflation amount using the following formula:\n", "\nSince inflation and returns compound, it is necessary to use the formula in step three. If an investor simply takes a linear estimate by subtracting 3%\u00a0from 23.3%, he arrives at an inflation-adjusted return of 20.3%, which in this example is 0.6%\u00a0too high.\n", "\nUsing inflation-adjusted returns is often a good idea because they put things into a very real-world perspective. Focusing on how investments are doing over the long-term can often present a better picture when it comes to its past performance (rather than a day-to-day, weekly, or even monthly glance).\n", "\nBut there may be\u00a0a good reason why nominal returns work over those adjusted for inflation. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nominal-rate-of-return.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nominal returns</a>\u00a0are generated before any taxes, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/11/investors-fees-cheat-sheet.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">investment fees</a>, or inflation. Since we live in a \u201chere and now\u201d world, these nominal prices and returns are what we deal with immediately to move forward. So, most people will want to get an idea of how the high and low price of an investment is\u2014relative to its future prospects\u2014rather than its past performance. In short, how the price fared when adjusted for inflation five years ago won\u2019t necessarily matter when an investor buys it tomorrow.\u00a0\n"]}
