In a chart, this pattern of activity would follow the shape of a capital \"J\".\n", "\nThe J-curve effect is often cited in economics to describe, for instance, the way that a country\u2019s <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bot.asp\">balance of trade</a> initially worsens following a devaluation of its currency, then quickly recovers and finally surpasses its previous performance.\n", "\nJ-curves are observed in other fields including medicine and political science. In each case, it depicts an initial loss followed by a significant gain to a level that exceeds the starting point.\n", "\nThe J-curve is useful to demonstrate the effects of an event or action over a set period of time. Put bluntly, it shows that things are going to get worse before they get better.\n", "\nIn economics, it is often used to observe the effects of a weaker currency on trade balances. The pattern is as follows:\n", "\nThe devaluation of the nation's currency had an immediate negative effect because of an inevitable lag in satisfying greater demand for the country's products.\n", "\nWhen a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/080613/effects-currency-fluctuations-economy.asp\">country\u2019s currency appreciates</a>, economists note, a reverse J-curve may occur. The country\u2019s exports abruptly become more expensive for importing countries. If other countries can fill the demand for a lower price, the stronger currency will reduce its export competitiveness. Local consumers may switch to imports, too, because they have become more competitive with locally-produced goods.\n", "\nThe term J-curve is used to describe the typical trajectory of investments made by a private equity firm.\n", "\nPrivate equity firms have a different path to profitability than public companies or the funds that invest in them.\n", "\nTheir portfolios, by design, are made up of companies that were performing poorly when they were purchased. The firm then spends substantial amounts of money retooling the company before spinning it off as a renewed company.\n", "\nThat means an initial decline in performance followed, at least theoretically, by a steep improvement in performance.\n"]}
