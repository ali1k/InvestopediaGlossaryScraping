The exporter eliminates risk by making the sale without recourse. It has no liability regarding the importer's possible default\u00a0on\u00a0the receivables.\n", "\nThe forfaiter is the individual or entity that purchases the receivables. The\u00a0importer then pays the amount of the receivables to the forfaiter. A forfaiter is typically a bank or a financial firm that specializes in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/export.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">export</a> financing.\n", "\nA forfaiter's purchase of the receivables expedites payment and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashflow.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cash flow</a> for the exporter. The importer's bank typically guarantees the amount.\n", "\nThe purchase also eliminates\u00a0the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditrisk.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">credit risk</a> involved in a credit sale to\u00a0an importer. Forfaiting facilitates the transaction for an importer that cannot afford to pay in full for goods upon delivery.\u00a0\n", "\nThe importer's receivables\u00a0convert\u00a0into a debt instrument that it can freely trade\u00a0on a secondary market. The receivables are typically in the form of unconditional <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/billofexchange.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bills of exchange</a> or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/promissorynote.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">promissory notes</a> that are legally enforceable, thus providing security for the forfaiter or a subsequent purchaser of the debt.\n", "\nThese debt instruments have a range of maturities\u00a0from as short as one month to as long as 10 years. Most <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maturity.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">maturities</a> fall between one and three years from the time of sale.\n", "\nForfaiting eliminates the risk that the exporter will receive payment. The practice also protects against credit risk, transfer risk, and the risks posed by <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/082515/how-avoid-exchange-rate-risk.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">foreign exchange rate</a> or interest rate changes.\u00a0Forfaiting simplifies the transaction by transforming a credit-based sale into a cash transaction. This credit-to-cash process gives immediate cash flow for the seller and eliminates collection costs. Additionally, the exporter can remove the accounts receivable, a liability, from its <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancesheet.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">balance sheet</a>.\n", "\nForfaiting is flexible. A forfaiter\u00a0can\u00a0tailor its offering to suit an exporter's needs and adapt it to a variety of international transactions. Exporters can use forfaiting in place of credit or insurance coverage for a sale. Forfaiting is helpful in situations where a country or a specific bank within the country does not have access to an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/export-credit-agency.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">export credit agency</a> (ECA). The practice allows\u00a0an exporter to transact business with buyers in countries with high levels of political risk.\n", "\nForfaiting mitigates risks for exporters, but it is generally more expensive than commercial lender financing leading to higher export costs. These higher costs are generally pushed onto the importer as part of the standard pricing. Additionally, only transactions over $100,000 with longer terms are eligible for forfaiting, but forfaiting is not available for <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deferredpaymentoption.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">deferred payments</a>.\n", "\nSome discrimination exists where developing countries are concerned compared to developed countries. For example, only selected currencies are taken for forfaiting because they have international <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">liquidity</a>. Lastly, there is no international credit agency that can provide guarantees for forfaiting companies. This lack of guarantee affects long-term forfaiting.\n", "\nThe Black Sea Trade &amp; Development Bank (BSTDB) <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www.bstdb.org/what-we-offer/special-products\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">lists forfaiting in its list of special products</a> along with underwriting, hedging instruments, financial leasing, and discounting.
