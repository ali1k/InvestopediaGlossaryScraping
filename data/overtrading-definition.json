Both are entirely different situations and have very different implications. An individual trader, whether working for themselves or employed on a trading desk by a financial firm, will have rules about how much risk they can take, including how many trades are appropriate for them to make.\n", "\nOnce they have reached this limit, to continue trading is to do so unsoundly. While such behavior may be bad for the trader or bad for the firm, it is not regulated in any way by outside entities.\n", "\nHowever, a broker overtrades when they excessively buy and sell stocks on the investor\u2019s behalf merely with the outcome of increased commissions. Overtrading, also known as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/churning.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">churning</a>, is a prohibited practice under securities law. Investors can observe that their broker has been overtrading when the frequency of their trades becomes counterproductive to their investment objectives, driving commission costs consistently higher without observable results over time.\n", "\nOvertrading can occur for a number of reasons but all such reasons have the same outcome: poor performance of the investments at the expense of increased broker fees. One reason this practice has been known to occur comes about when brokers are pressured to place newly issued <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">securities</a> underwritten by a firm's investment banking arm.\n", "\nFor example, each broker may receive a 10% bonus if they can secure a certain allotment of a new security to their customers. Such incentives may not have the investors' best interest in mind. Investors can protect themselves from overtrading (churning) through a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wrapaccount.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">wrap account</a>\u2014a type of account managed for a flat rate rather than charging a commission on every transaction. The SEC also looks into complaints of brokers who tend to put their own interests over their clients.\n", "\nIndividual traders usually overtrade after they have suffered a significant loss or a number of smaller losses in a usually long losing streak. To recoup their capital, or to seek \u201crevenge\u201d on the market after a string of losing trades, they may try harder to make up profits wherever they can, usually by increasing the size and frequency of their trades. While this practice often results in poor performance of the trader, the SEC does not regulate this kind of behavior because it is being done on the trader's own account.\n", "\nThe <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</a> defines overtrading (churning) as excessive buying and selling in a customer\u2019s account that the broker controls to generate increased commissions. Brokers who overtrade may be in breach of SEC Rule 15c1-7 that governs manipulative and deceptive conduct.\n", "\nThe Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) governs overtrading under rule 2111 and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) prohibits the practice under Rule 408(c). Investors who believe they are a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/09/forex-broker-scam.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">victim of churning</a> can file a complaint with either the SEC or FINRA.\n", "\nOvertrading in one's own account can only be curtailed by self-regulation. Below are some\u00a0common forms of overtrading that investors may engage in, and begin informed about each can lead to better self-awareness.\n", "\nThe discretionary trader uses flexible position sizes and\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leverage.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">leverage</a>\u00a0and does not establish rules for changing size. Although such flexibility can have its advantages, more often than not, it proves to be the trader's downfall.\n", "\n<strong>\ufeff</strong>Traders new to technical indicators often use them as justification for making a predetermined trade. They have already decided what position to take and then look for indicators that will back up their decision, allowing them to feel more comfortable. They then develop rules, learn more indicators, and devise a system. This behavior is classified as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/confirmation-bias.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">confirmation bias</a> and usually leads to systemic losses over time.\n", "\n<strong>\ufeff</strong>Craving the action, traders often develop a \"shotgun blast\" approach, buying anything and everything they think might be good. A telltale sign of shotgun trading is multiple small positions open concurrently, none of which the trader has a specific plan for. But an even more firm diagnosis can be made by reviewing trade history and then asking why a\u00a0particular trade was made at the time. A shotgun trader will struggle to provide a specific answer to that question.\n", "\nThere are a few steps traders can take to help prevent overtrading:\n"]}
