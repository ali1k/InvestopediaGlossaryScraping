Both benchmarks are offered by the European Money Markets Institute (EMMI). The main difference between Eonia and Euribor is the maturities of the loans they are based on. Eonia\u00a0is an overnight rate, while Euribor is actually eight different rates based on loans with maturities varying from one week to 12 months.\n", "\nThe panel banks that contribute to the rates are also different: only 20 banks contribute to Euribor, instead of 28.
