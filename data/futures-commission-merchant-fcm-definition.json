An FCM is an individual or organization involved in the solicitation or acceptance of buy or sell orders for <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futures.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">futures</a> or options on futures in exchange for payment of money (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commission.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">commission</a>) or other assets from customers. An FCM also has the responsibility of collecting <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margin.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">margin</a> from customers. The FCM is also responsible for ensuring asset delivery after the futures contract has expired.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nIn Europe, FCMs are analogous to clearing members of the futures market.\n", "\nFCMs are required to be registered with the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nfa.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">National Futures Association</a> (NFA). This is required unless the entity handles transactions only for the\u00a0firm itself, or the firm's affiliates, top officers, or directors; or if the entity is a non-U.S. resident or firm with only non-U.S. customers and submits all trades for clearing to an FCM.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"7\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nAn FCM may either be a clearing member firm of one or more exchanges (a \"clearing FCM\") or a non-clearing member firm (a \"non-clearing FCM\").
