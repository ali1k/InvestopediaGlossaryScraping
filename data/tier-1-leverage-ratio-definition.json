href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/baselcommittee.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Basel Committee on Banking Supervision</a> in 2009. The ratio uses Tier 1 capital to evaluate how leveraged a bank is in relation to its overall assets. The higher the Tier 1 leverage ratio is, the higher the likelihood that the bank could withstand a negative shock to its balance sheet.\n", "\nTier 1 capital is the core capital of a bank according to Basel III and consists of the most stable and liquid capital as well as the most effective at absorbing losses during a financial crisis or downturn.\n", "\nThe denominator in the Tier 1 leverage ratio is a bank's total exposures, which include its consolidated assets, derivative exposure, and certain off-balance sheet exposures. Basel III required banks to include off-balance-sheet exposures, such as commitments to provide loans to third parties, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standbyletterofcredit.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">standby letters of credit</a> (SLOC), acceptances, and trade letters of credit.\n", "\nBasel III established a 3% minimum requirement for the Tier 1 leverage ratio, while it left open the possibility of increasing that threshold for certain systematically important financial institutions.\n", "\nIn 2014, the Federal Reserve, the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/office-comptroller-currency-occ.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Office of the Comptroller of the Currency</a> (OCC), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) released regulatory capital rules that imposed higher <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leverageratio.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">leverage ratios</a> for banks of certain sizes effective as of Jan. 1, 2018. Bank holding companies with more than $700 billion in consolidated total assets or more than $10 trillion in assets under management must maintain an additional 2% buffer, making their minimum Tier 1 leverage ratios 5%.\n", "\nIn addition, if an insured depository institution is being covered by a corrective action framework, meaning it demonstrated capital deficiencies in the past, it must demonstrate at least a 6% Tier 1 leverage ratio to be considered well-capitalized.\n", "\nBelow are the capital ratios taken from the financial statements of Bank of America Corporation <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=bac\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">(BAC)</a> as reported in the bank's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"http://investor.bankofamerica.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=71595&amp;p=irol-sec#fbid=o1VTKXimpIk\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Q3 earnings report</a> on October 31, 2018.\n", "\nThe Tier 1 capital ratio is the ratio of a bank\u2019s core\u00a0Tier 1 capital\u2014that is, its equity capital and disclosed reserves\u2014to its total risk-weighted assets.

The ratio uses Tier 1 capital to judge how leveraged a bank is in relation to its consolidated assets, whereas the Tier 1 capital ratio measures the bank's core capital against its risk-weighted assets.\n", "\nA limitation of using the Tier 1 leverage ratio is that investors are reliant on banks to properly and honestly calculate and report their Tier 1 capital and total assets figures. If a bank doesn't report or calculate their figures properly, the leverage ratio could be inaccurate. A leverage ratio above 5% is currently what regulators are looking for, but we won't actually know until the next financial crisis hits to find out whether banks are truly able to withstand a financial shock that it causes.\n"]}
