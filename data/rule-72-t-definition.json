The IRS still subjects the withdrawals to the account holder\u2019s normal income tax rate.\n", "\nRule 72(t) actually refers to code 72(t), section 2, which specifies exceptions to the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earlywithdrawal.asp\">early-withdrawal tax</a> that allow\u00a0IRA owners to withdraw funds from their retirement account before age 59\u00bd,\u00a0as long as certain qualifications, known as SEPP\u00a0regulations, are met.\n", "\nTo take advantage of this rule, the owner of the retirement account must take\u00a0at least five <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sepp.asp\">substantially equal periodic payments</a> (SEPPs), and\u00a0the amount of the payments depend\u00a0on the owner\u2019s life expectancy as calculated through IRS-approved methods. These payments must thus occur over the span of five years or until the owner reaches 59\u00bd, whichever\u00a0period is longer.\n", "\nThe amounts an account holder receives in the periodic payments enabled by rule 72(t) depend on life expectancy, which can be calculated through one of three IRS-approved methods:\n", "\nThe <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixed-amortization-method.asp\">amortization method</a> determines yearly payment amounts by amortizing the balance of an IRA owner\u2019s account over single or joint life expectancy. This method develops the largest and most reasonable\u00a0amount an individual can remove, and\u00a0the amount is fixed annually.\n", "\nThe minimum distribution method takes a dividing factor from the IRS\u2019s single or joint life expectancy table, using it to divide the retirement account\u2019s balance. This method is nearly the opposite of the amortization method, as\u00a0the annual early withdrawal payments are likely to vary from\u00a0year to year, though not substantially. The key difference between this method and the amortization method is the resulting payments with the minimum distribution method, as the name implies, are the lowest possible amounts that can be withdrawn.\n", "\nThe final IRS-approved calculation is the annuitization method, which uses an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/annuity-factor-method.asp\">annuity factor method</a> provided by the IRS to determine equivalent or nearly equivalent payments in accordance with the SEPP\u00a0regulation. This method offers account holders a fixed annual payout, with the amount typically falling somewhere between the highest and lowest amount the account owner can withdraw.\n", "\nAs an example, assume a 53-year-old woman who has an IRA earning 1.5% annually\u00a0with a balance of $250,000\u00a0wishes to withdraw money early under rule 72(t). Using the amortization method, the woman would receive approximately $10,042 in yearly payments. With the minimum distribution method, she would receive around $7,962 annually over a five-year period. Using the annuitization method, approximately $9,976 would be her annual payment amount.\n", "\nWithdrawing money from a retirement account is a financial last resort. This is why the IRS has exceptions for specific circumstances like disability and illness. If you do not meet any of the criteria for other exceptions, then rule 72(t) can be used if you have exhausted all other avenues. It should not be used as an emergency fund strategy, as any withdrawals affect your future financial stability significantly.\n"]}
