It exploits short-lived variations in the price of identical or similar financial instruments in different markets or in different forms.\n", "\nArbitrage exists as a result of market <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inefficientmarket.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">inefficiencies</a> and it both exploits those inefficiencies and resolves them.\n", "\nArbitrage can be used whenever any stock, commodity, or currency may be purchased in one market at a given price and simultaneously sold in another market at a higher price. The situation creates an opportunity for a risk-free profit for the trader.\n", "\nArbitrage provides a mechanism to ensure that prices do not deviate substantially from <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fairvalue.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fair value</a> for long periods of time. With advancements in technology, it has become extremely difficult to profit from pricing errors in the market. Many traders have computerized trading systems set to monitor <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/121714/what-are-differences-between-divergence-and-convergence.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fluctuations</a> in similar <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financialinstrument.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">financial instruments</a>. Any inefficient pricing setups are usually acted upon quickly, and the opportunity is eliminated, often in a matter of seconds.\n", "\nAs a straightforward example of arbitrage, consider the following. The stock of Company X is trading at $20 on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) while, at the same moment, it is trading for $20.05 on the London Stock Exchange (LSE).\n", "\nA trader can buy the stock on the NYSE and immediately sell the same shares on the LSE, earning a profit of 5 cents per share.\n", "\nThe trader can continue to exploit this arbitrage until the specialists on the NYSE run out of inventory of Company X's stock, or until the specialists on the NYSE or LSE adjust their prices to wipe out the opportunity.\n", "\nA trickier example can be found in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/triangulararbitrage.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">triangular arbitrage</a>. In this case, the trader converts one currency into another at one bank, converts that second currency to another at a second bank, and finally converts the third currency back to the original currency at a third bank.\n", "\nEach of the banks would have the information efficiency to ensure that all of its currency rates were aligned, thus requiring the use of three financial institutions for this strategy.\n", "\nFor example, assume you begin with $2 million. You see that at three different institutions the following currency exchange rates are immediately available:\n", "\nFirst, you would convert the $2 million to euros at the 0.894 rate, giving you 1,788,000 euros. Next, you would take the 1,788,000 euros and convert them to British pounds at the 1.276 rate, giving you 1,401,254 pounds. Next, you would take the pounds and convert them back to U.S. dollars at the 1.432 rate, giving you $2,006,596. Your total risk-free arbitrage profit would be $6,596.\n", "\nArbitrage is trading that exploits the tiny differences in price between identical assets in two or more markets. The arbitrage trader buys the asset in one market and sells it in the other market at the same time in order to pocket the difference between the two prices.\n", "\nThere are more complicated variations in this scenario, but all depend on identifying market \"inefficiencies.\"\n", "\nArbitrageurs, as arbitrage traders are called, are usually working on behalf of large financial institutions.

As they buy and sell, the price differences between identical or similar assets narrow. The lower-priced assets are bid up while the higher-priced assets are sold off.\n", "\nIn this manner, arbitrage resolves inefficiencies in the market\u2019s pricing and adds liquidity to the market.\n"]}
