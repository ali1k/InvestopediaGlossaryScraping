A typical incontestability clause specifies that a contract will not be voidable after two or three years due to a misstatement.\n", "\nIncontestability clauses help protect insured people from firms who may try to avoid paying benefits in the event of a claim. While this provision benefits the insured,\u00a0it cannot\u00a0protect against outright fraud.\n", "\nThe incontestability clause in life insurance policies is one of the strongest protections for a policyholder or beneficiary. While many other legal rules for insurance\u00a0favor the insurance companies, this rule is notably and strongly on the side of the consumer.\n", "\nWhile conventional rules for contracts stipulate that if\u00a0false or incomplete information was provided by one party\u00a0when making the contract, then the second party has the right to void, or cancel, the agreement.\u00a0The incontestability clause forbids insurance companies from doing precisely this.\n", "\nErrors are easy to make\u00a0when applying for life insurance. An insurance company will often require a\u00a0complete medical history before the policy is approved. If an applicant forgets a single detail, the insurance company has potential grounds to\u00a0deny paying life insurance benefits\u00a0later on.\n", "\nReputable insurance companies originally introduced the incontestability clause in the late 1800s to build consumer trust. By promising to pay full benefits after the policy has been in place for two years (even if there were some errors in the original application), these insurance companies tried to clean up the industry\u2019s image. The effort was successful, and early in the 20th century, state governments began to pass laws requiring\u00a0the incontestability clause.\n", "\nToday, the clock immediately begins to run on the contestability period as soon as a life insurance policy is purchased. If, after two years, the insurance company hasn't\u00a0found an error in the original application, benefits are assured.\n", "\nEven within that period, it\u2019s not easy for the company to rescind a policy. Under most state laws, the insurance company must file suit in court\u00a0to nullify a\u00a0contract. Sending a notice to the policyholder is not enough.\n"]}
