Named after sponsors Senator Christopher J.

It requires lenders, excluding automobile lenders, to disclose information in a form that is easy for consumers to read and understand; an example is the simplified terms now on credit card applications.\n", "\nAnother key component of Dodd-Frank, the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volcker-rule.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Volcker Rule</a>, restricts the ways banks can invest, limiting speculative trading, and eliminating <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proprietarytrading.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">proprietary trading</a>.

Dodd-Frank set up centralized exchanges for swaps trading to reduce the possibility of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/counterpartyrisk.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">counterparty default</a> and also required greater disclosure of swaps trading information to increase transparency in those markets.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"8\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff The Volcker Rule also regulates financial firms' use of derivatives in an attempt to prevent \"too big to fail\" institutions from taking large risks that might wreak havoc on the broader economy.\n", "\nBecause <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditrating.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">credit rating</a> agencies were accused of contributing to the financial crisis by giving out misleadingly favorable investment ratings, Dodd-Frank established the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SEC</a> Office of Credit Ratings. The office is charged with ensuring that agencies provide meaningful and reliable credit ratings of the businesses, municipalities, and other entities they evaluate.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"9\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nDodd-Frank also strengthened and expanded the existing whistleblower program promulgated by the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sarbanesoxleyact.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX)</a>.

Detractors, however, have argued that the act could harm the competitiveness of U.S. firms relative to their foreign counterparts. In particular, they contend that its regulatory compliance requirements unduly burden community banks and smaller financial institutions\u2014despite the fact that they played no role in causing the financial crisis.\n", "\nSuch financial-world notables as former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, Blackstone Group L.P.

(JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon also argue that, while each institution is undoubtedly safer due to the capital constraints imposed by Dodd-Frank, the constraints also make for a more illiquid market overall. The lack of liquidity can be especially potent in the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bondmarket.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bond market</a>, where all securities are not <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marktomarket.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mark to market</a> and many bonds lack a constant supply of buyers and sellers.\n", "\nThe higher <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bank-reserve.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reserve</a> requirements under Dodd-Frank mean banks must keep a higher percentage of their assets in cash, which decreases the amount they are able to hold in marketable securities. In effect, this limits the bond market-making role that banks have traditionally undertaken. With banks unable to play the part of a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketmaker.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">market maker</a>, prospective buyers are likely to have a harder time finding counteracting sellers. More importantly, prospective sellers may find it more difficult to find counteracting buyers.\n", "\nSiding with the critics, the U.S. Congress passed a bill in 2018 called the\u00a0Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, which rolls back significant portions of the Dodd-Frank Act. It was signed into law by President Trump on May 24, 2018.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"11\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff These are some of the provisions of the new law, and some of the areas in which standards were loosened:\n", "\nThe new law eases the Dodd-Frank regulations for small and regional banks by increasing the asset\u00a0threshold for the application of prudential standards, stress test requirements, and mandatory risk committees.\n", "\nFor institutions that have <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/custodian.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">custody</a> of clients' assets but do not function as lenders or traditional bankers, the new law provides for lower <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalrequirement.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">capital requirements</a> and leverage ratios.\n", "\nThe new law exempts escrow requirements for residential mortgage loans held by a depository institution or credit union\u00a0under certain conditions.
