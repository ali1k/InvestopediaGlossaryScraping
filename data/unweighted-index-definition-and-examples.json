An equivalent dollar amount is invested in each of the index components. For an unweighted stock index, one stock's performance will not have a dramatic effect on the performance of the index as a whole.\n", "\nThis differs from <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/weighted.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">weighted</a> indexes, where some stocks are given more percentage weight than others, usually based on their <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">market capitalizations</a>.\n", "\nUnweighted indexes are rare, as most indexes are based on market capitalizations, whereby companies with larger market caps are accorded higher index weights than companies with lower market caps.\n", "\nThe most prominent of the unweighted stock indexes is the S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Index (EWI), which is the unweighted version of the widely-used <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sp500.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">S&amp;P 500 Index</a>. The S&amp;P 500 EWI includes the same constituents as the capitalization-weighted S&amp;P 500 Index, but each of the 500 companies is allocated a fixed percentage weight of 0.2%.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nPassive fund managers construct <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indexfund.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">index funds</a> or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">exchange-traded fund</a> (ETF) based on leading indexes such as the S&amp;P 500 Index, which is a weighted index.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff Most choose to mimic their investment vehicles on market capitalization-weighted indexes, which means they must buy more of the stocks that are rising in value to match the index, or sell more of the stocks that are declining in value. This can create a circular situation of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/momentum.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">momentum</a> where an increase in a stock's value leads to more buying of the stock, which will add to the upward pressure on the price. The reverse is also true on the downside.\n", "\nAn index fund or ETF structured on an unweighted index, on the other hand, sticks to equal allocations among the components of an index. In the case of the S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Index, the fund manager would periodically rebalance investment amounts so that each is 0.2% of the total.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nOne type of index isn't necessarily better than another, they are just showing different things. The weighted index shows performance typically by market capitalization, while the unweighted index reflects unweighted performance across the index's components.\n", "\nOne of the pitfalls of a weighted index is that returns will be based largely on the most heavily weighted components, and the smaller component returns may be hidden or have little effect. This could mean that most of the stocks in the S&amp;P 500, for example, are actually declining even though the index is rising because the stocks with the most weight are rising while most of the stocks with little weight are falling.\n", "\nThe flip side of this argument is that smaller companies come and go, and therefore they shouldn't be given as much weight as the large companies with a much larger <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholder.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">shareholder</a> base.\n", "\nAn unweighted or equal weight index reflects how a whole pool of stocks is doing. It may be a better index for an investor who isn't investing in the most heavily weighted stocks of a weighted index, or is more interested in whether most stocks are moving higher or lower. The unweighted index does a better job of showing this than a weighted index.\n", "\nIn terms of performance, sometimes an unweighted index outperforms the weighted index, and other times the reverse is true. When deciding which is a better index to track or mimic, look at the performance and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volatility.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">volatility</a> of both to assess which is the better option.\n", "\nThe <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nasdaq100.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nasdaq 100 Index</a> is one hundred of the largest companies listed on the Nasdaq exchange.

The following chart shows the Nasdaq 100 EWI as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/candlestick.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">candles</a> and the Nasdaq 100 as a pink line.\n", "\nBetween 2006 and 2019, the Nasdaq 100 returned 70% more than its EWI counterpart, showing that the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/large-cap.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">larger-cap</a> stocks tended to bolster returns for the weighted index.
