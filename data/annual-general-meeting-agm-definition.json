In large companies, this meeting is typically the only time during the year when shareholders and executives interact.\n", "\nThe exact rules governing an AGM vary according to jurisdiction. As outlined by many states in their laws of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incorporate.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">incorporation</a>, both public and private companies must hold AGMs, though the rules tend to be more stringent for <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/publiccompany.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">publicly traded companies</a>.\n", "\nPublic companies must file annual <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proxystatement.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">proxy statements</a>, known as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-def-14a.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Form DEF 14A</a>, with the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC).\u00a0The filing will specify the date, time, and location of the annual meeting, as well as executive compensation and any material matters of the company concerning shareholder voting and nominated directors.\n", "\nAnnual general meetings (AGMs) are important for the transparency they provide, the ability to include shareholders, as well as bringing management to accountability.\n", "\nThe corporate bylaws that govern a company, along with its jurisdiction, memorandum, and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/articles-of-association.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">articles of association</a>, contain the rules governing an AGM. For example, there are provisions detailing how far in advance shareholders must be notified of where and when an AGM will be held and how to vote by <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proxy.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">proxy</a>. In most jurisdictions, the following items, by law, must be discussed at an AGM:\n", "\nIf the company has not been performing well, the AGM is also when shareholders can question the board of directors and management as to why performance has been poor. The shareholders can demand satisfactory answers as well as to inquire about the strategies that management plans to implement to turn the company around.\n", "\nThe AGM is also when shareholders can vote on company matters other than electing the board of directors. For example, if management is contemplating a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mergersandacquisitions.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">merger or an acquisition</a>, the proposal can be presented to the shareholders and they can vote on whether or not the company should proceed.\n", "\nSeveral other elements may be added to an AGM agenda. Often, the company's directors and executives use an AGM as their opportunity to share their vision of the company's future with the shareholders. For example, at the AGM for Berkshire Hathaway, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/01/071801.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Warren Buffett</a> delivers long speeches on his views of the company and the economy as a whole.\n", "\nBerkshire Hathaway's annual gathering\u00a0has become so popular that it is attended by tens of thousands of people each year, and it's been dubbed the \"Woodstock for Capitalists.\"\n"]}
