Overwriting is a technique used by speculative option writers in an attempt to profit from the premiums paid by option buyers for option\u00a0contracts the writer hopes will expire without being exercised. Overwriting\u00a0is considered risky and should only be attempted by investors who have a comprehensive understanding of options and options strategies.\n", "\nOverwriting can help investors who hold a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/11/dividend-capture-strategy.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">dividend-paying stock</a> to increase their income by collecting the premium they receive from writing an option against the stock they own. For example, if they currently receive a 3% dividend yield, they could increase that yield to effectively more than 10% by overwriting.\u00a0The strategy is most effective when stock prices have had a sharp decline and premiums get overvalued, as the\u00a0higher premiums help offset possible further losses.\n", "\nThe downside risk to overwriting is that if the stock\u2019s price rises sharply, the seller loses any profit they\u00a0would have made above the options <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/strike-price/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">strike price</a>.

This is why the seller hopes that the call option will expire worthless\u2014they get to keep the premium already collected AND continue to hold an asset that is on the rise.\u00a0If the stock declines, the $5 premium the seller received\u00a0helps to partially offset any\u00a0loss incurred.\n"]}
