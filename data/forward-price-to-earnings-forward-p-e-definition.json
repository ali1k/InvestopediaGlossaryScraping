Analysts estimate that the company's earnings will grow by 10% over the next fiscal year. The company has a current P/E ratio of $50 / 5 = 10x.\n", "\nThe forward P/E, on the other hand, would be $50 / (5 x 1.10) = 9.1x. Note that the forward P/E is smaller than the current P/E since the forward P/E accounts for future earnings growth relative to today's share price.\n", "\nAnalysts like to think of the P/E ratio as a price tag on earnings. It is used to calculate a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/relative-value.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">relative value</a> based on a company's level of earnings. In theory, $1 of earnings at company A is worth the same as $1 of earnings at company B. If this is the case, both companies should also be trading at the same price, but this is rarely the case.\n", "\nIf company A is trading for $5, and company B is trading for $10, this implies that the market values company B's earnings more. There can be various interpretations as to why company B is valued more.\u00a0It could mean that company B's earnings are overvalued. It could also mean that company B deserves a premium on the value of its earnings due to superior management and a better <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/businessmodel.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">business model</a>.\n", "\nWhen calculating the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trailingpe.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">trailing P/E ratio</a>, analysts compare today's price against earnings for the last 12 months, or the last <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiscalyear.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fiscal year</a>. However, both are based on <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/03/103103.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">historical prices</a>. Analysts use earnings estimates to determine what the relative value of the company will be at a future level of earnings. The forward P/E estimates the relative value of the earnings.\n", "\nFor example, if the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentprice.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">current price</a> of company B is $10, and earnings are estimated to double next year to $2, the forward P/E ratio is 5x, or half the value of the company when it made $1 in earnings. If the forward P/E ratio is lower than the current P/E ratio, this implies that analysts are expecting earnings to increase. If the forward P/E is higher than the current P/E ratio, analysts expect a decrease in earnings.\n", "\nForward P/E uses projected EPS. Meanwhile, trailing P/E relies on past performance by dividing the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/061615/how-companys-share-price-determined.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">current share price</a>\u00a0by the total EPS earnings over the past 12 months. Trailing P/E is the most popular P/E metric because it's the most objective\u2014assuming the company reported earnings accurately. Some investors prefer to look at the trailing P/E because they don't trust another individual\u2019s\u00a0earnings estimates.\n", "\nHowever, trailing P/E also has its share of shortcomings\u2014namely, a company\u2019s past performance does not signal future behavior. Investors should thus\u00a0commit money based on future\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earnings-power.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">earnings power</a>, not the past. The fact that the EPS number remains constant while the stock prices fluctuate is also a problem. If a major company event drives the stock price significantly higher or lower, the trailing P/E will be less reflective of those changes.\n", "\nSince forward P/E relies on estimated future earnings, it is subject to miscalculation and/or analysts' bias. There are other inherent problems with the forward P/E also. Companies could underestimate earnings to beat the consensus estimate P/E when the next quarter's earnings are announced.\n", "\nOther companies may overstate the estimate and later adjust it going into\u00a0their next\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earnings-announcement.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">earnings announcement</a>. Furthermore, external analysts may also provide estimates, which may diverge from the company estimates, creating confusion.\n", "\nIf you're using forward P/E as the central basis of your\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investment-thesis.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">investment thesis</a>, research the companies thoroughly. If the company updates its guidance, this will affect the forward P/E in a way that might cause you to change your opinion. It is good practice to use both forward and trailing P/E to come to a more trustworthy figure.\n", "\nYou can calculate a company's forward P/E for the next fiscal year in Microsoft Excel. As shown above, the formula for the forward P/E is simply a company's market price per share divided by its expected earnings per share. In Microsoft Excel, first increase the widths of columns A, B, and C by right-clicking on each of the columns and left-clicking on \"Column Width\" and change the value to 30.\n", "\nAssume you wanted to compare the forward P/E ratio between two companies in the same sector. Enter the name of the first company into cell B1 and the name of the second company into cell C1. Then:\n", "\nFor example, assume company ABC is currently trading at $50 and has an expected EPS of $2.60. Enter \"Company ABC\" into cell B1. Next, enter \"=50\" into cell B2 and \"=2.6\" into cell B3. Then, enter \"=B2/B3\" into cell B4. The resulting forward P/E ratio for company ABC is 19.23.\n", "\nOn the other hand, company DEF currently has a\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketvalue.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">market value</a>\u00a0per share of $30 and has an expected EPS of $1.80. Enter \"Company DEF\" into cell C1. Next, enter \"=30\" into cell C2 and \"=1.80\" into cell C3. Then, enter \"=C2/C3\" into cell C4. The resulting forward P/E for company DEF is 16.67.\n", "\nSince company ABC has a higher forward P/E ratio than company DEF, this indicates that investors expect higher earnings in the future from company ABC than company DEF.\n"]}
