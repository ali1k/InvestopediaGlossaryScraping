Mutual companies (not to be confused\u00a0with mutual funds) are entities seeded by private investors who are also customers or members of these operations. Businesses such as insurance companies, savings and loan associations, banking trusts, and credit unions are commonly structured as mutual companies.\n", "\nMutual insurance companies typically collect policyholder <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurance-premium.asp\">premiums</a> from their members and spread risk and profits through various mechanisms. In America, this practice dates back to 1716, when the nation's first-ever insurance company was created by the Synod of Philadelphia, which structured the operation as a mutual company.\n", "\nIn 2000 and 2001, a flurry of noteworthy demutualization events occurred in the insurance space, with the demutualization of Prudential Insurance Company, Sun Life Assurance Company, Phoenix Home Life Mutual Insurance Company, Principal Life Insurance Company, and the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (MetLife).\n", "\nIn a demutualization, a mutual company elects to change its corporate structure to a public company, where prior members may receive a structured compensation or ownership conversion rights in the transition, in the form of shares in the company.\n", "\nSeveral demutualization methodologies exist. In a \"full demutualization,\" a company launches an initial public offering (IPO), where it auctions stock to shareholders, who may trade their equity positions over a public <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exchange.asp\">market exchange</a>. Under this scenario, the former members of the mutual company do not automatically receive stock, and must consequently invest separately.\n", "\nAlternatively, with the \u201csponsored demutualization\u201d method, after the IPO, former members of the mutual company automatically receive shares in the newly-formed company. Under this model, members typically receive greater compensation for their previous membership and, generally, don\u2019t have to invest personal capital in the newly-issued shares. However, they may buy additional shares, if they choose.\n", "\nWhen a demutualization occurs, former members may still utilize the products and services as they did before, however, prices and other terms of the transactions may change.\n"]}
