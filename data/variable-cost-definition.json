Variable costs increase or decrease depending on a company's production volume; they rise as production increases and fall as production decreases. Examples of variable costs include the costs of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rawmaterials.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">raw materials</a> and packaging. A variable cost can be contrasted with a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixedcost.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fixed cost</a>.\n", "\nThe total expenses incurred by any business consist of fixed costs and variable costs. Variable costs are dependent on production output. The variable cost of production is a constant amount per unit produced. As the volume of production and output increases, variable costs will also increase. Conversely, when fewer products are produced, the variable costs associated with production will consequently decrease.\n", "\nExamples of variable costs are sales <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commission.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">commissions</a>, direct labor costs, cost of raw materials used in production, and utility costs. The total variable cost is simply the quantity of output multiplied by the variable cost per unit of output. Variable costs are usually viewed as short-term costs as they can be adjusted quickly.\n", "\nFixed costs are expenses that remain the same regardless of production output. Whether a firm makes sales or not, it must pay its fixed costs, as these costs are independent of output.\n", "\nExamples of fixed costs are rent, employee salaries, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurance.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">insurance</a>, and office supplies. A company must still pay its rent for the space it occupies to run its business operations irrespective of the volume of products manufactured and sold. If a business increased production or decreased production, rent will stay exactly the same. Although fixed costs can change over a period of time, the change will not be related to production, and as such, fixed costs are viewed as long-term costs.\n", "\nThere is also a category of costs that falls between fixed and variable costs, known as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/semivariablecost.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">semi-variable costs</a> (also known as semi-fixed costs or mixed costs). These are costs composed of a mixture of both fixed and variable components. Costs are fixed for a set level of production or consumption and become variable after this production level is exceeded. If no production occurs, a fixed cost is often still incurred.\n", "\nLet\u2019s assume that it costs a bakery $15 to make a cake\u2014$5 for raw materials such as sugar, milk, and flour, and $10 for the direct labor involved in making one cake. The table below shows how the variable costs change as the number of cakes baked vary.\n", "\nAs the production output of cakes increases, the bakery\u2019s variable costs also increase. When the bakery does not bake any cake, its variable costs drop to zero.\n", "\nFixed costs and variable costs comprise the total cost. Total cost is a determinant of a company\u2019s profits, which is calculated as:\n", "\nA company can increase its profits by decreasing its total costs. Since fixed costs are more challenging to bring down (for example, reducing rent may entail the company moving to a cheaper location), most businesses seek to reduce their variable costs. Thus, decreasing costs usually means decreasing variable costs.\n", "\nIf the bakery sells each cake for $35, its <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/grossprofit.asp\">gross profit</a> per cake will be $35 - $15 = $20. To calculate the net profit, the fixed costs have to be subtracted from the gross profit. Assuming the bakery incurs monthly fixed costs of $900, which includes utilities, rent, and insurance, its monthly profit will be:\n", "\nA business incurs a loss when fixed costs are higher than gross profits. In the bakery\u2019s case, it has gross profits of $700 - $300 = $400 when it sells only 20 cakes a month. Since its fixed cost of $900 is higher than $400, it would lose $500 in sales. The break-even point occurs when fixed costs equal the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/grossmargin.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">gross margin</a>, resulting in no profits or loss. In this case, when the bakery sells 45 cakes for total variable costs of $675, it breaks even.\n", "\nA company that seeks to increase its profit by decreasing variable costs may need to cut down on fluctuating costs for raw materials, direct labor, and advertising. However, the cost cut should not affect product or service quality as this would have an adverse effect on sales. By reducing its variable costs, a business increases its gross profit margin or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/contributionmargin.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">contribution margin</a>.\n", "\nThe contribution margin allows management to determine how much revenue and profit can be earned from each unit of product sold.

bakery is ($35 - $15) / $35 = 0.5714, or 57.14%. If the bakery reduces its variable costs to $10, its contribution margin will increase to ($35 - $10) / $35 = 71.43%. Profits increase when the contribution margin increases. If the bakery reduces its variable cost by $5, it would earn $0.71 for every one dollar in sales.\n", "\nCommon examples of variable costs include costs of goods sold (COGS), raw materials &amp; inputs to production, packaging, wages &amp; commissions, and certain utilities (e.g. electricity or gas that increases with production capacity).\n", "\nVariable costs are directly related to the cost of production of goods or services, while fixed costs do not vary with level of production. Variable costs are commonly designated as\u00a0cost of goods sold\u00a0(COGS), whereas fixed costs are not usually included in COGS. Fluctuations in sales and production levels can affect variable costs if factors such as sales commissions are included in per-unit production costs. Meanwhile, fixed costs must still be paid even if production slows down significantly.\n", "\nIf companies ramp up production to meet demand, their variable costs will increase as well. If these costs increase at a rate that exceeds the profits generated from new units produced, it may not make sense to expand. A company in such a case will need to evaluate why it cannot achieve economies of scale. In economies of scale, variable costs as a percentage of overall cost per unit decreases as the scale of production ramps up.\n", "\nNo. Marginal cost refers to how much it costs to produce one additional unit. Marginal cost will take into account total cost of production, including both fixed and variable costs. Since fixed costs are static, however, the weight of fixed costs will decline as production scales up.\n", "\n<br/>\n"]}
