Social responsibility has become increasingly important to investors and consumers who seek investments that are not just profitable but also contribute to the welfare of society and the environment. However, critics argue that the basic nature of business does not consider society as a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stakeholder.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">stakeholder</a>.\n", "\nSocial responsibility means that individuals and companies have a duty to act in the best interests of their environment and society as a whole. Social responsibility, as it applies to business, is known as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corp-social-responsibility.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">corporate social responsibility</a> (CSR), and is becoming a more prominent area of focus within businesses due to shifting social norms.\n", "\nThe crux of this theory is to enact policies that promote an ethical balance between the dual mandates of striving for profitability and benefiting society as a whole. These policies can be either ones of commission (philanthropy: donations of money, time, or resources) or omission (e.g., \"go green\" initiatives like reducing greenhouse gases or abiding by EPA regulations to limit pollution).\n", "\nMany companies, such as those with \"green\" policies, have made social responsibility an integral part of their <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/businessmodel.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">business models</a>, and they have done so without compromising profitability. In 2019, <em>Forbes</em> named the top 100 socially responsible companies in the world. Topping the list is the Lego Group, followed closely by Natura (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=ntco\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NTCO</a>), then technology giants, Microsoft (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=msft\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MSFT</a>) and Google (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=googl\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GOOGL</a>). At the bottom of the list in spot 100 is Starbucks (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"5\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=sbux\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SBUX</a>).<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nAdditionally, more and more investors and consumers are factoring in a company's commitment to socially responsible practices before making an investment or purchase. As such, embracing social responsibility can benefit the prime directive: maximization of shareholder value.\n", "\nThere is a moral imperative, as well. Actions, or lack thereof, will affect future generations. Put simply, being socially responsible is just good business practice, and a failure to do so can have a deleterious effect on the balance sheet.\n", "\nIn general, social responsibility is more effective when a company takes it on voluntarily, as opposed to being required by the government to do so through regulation. Social responsibility can boost company morale, and this is especially true when a company can\u00a0engage employees with its social causes.\n", "\nThe <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/international-organization-for-standardization-iso.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">International Organization for Standardization</a>\u00a0(ISO) emphasizes that a business's ability to maintain a balance between pursuing economic performance and adhering to societal and environmental issues is a critical factor in operating efficiently and effectively.\u00a0\n", "\nSocial responsibility takes on different meanings within industries and companies. For example, Starbucks Corp. and Ben &amp; Jerry's Homemade Holdings Inc. have blended social responsibility into the core of their operations.\n", "\nBoth companies purchase Fair Trade Certified ingredients to manufacture their products and actively support sustainable farming in the regions where they source ingredients. Big-box retailer Target Corp., also well known for its social responsibility programs, has donated money to communities in which the stores operate, including education grants.\u00a0\n", "\nThe key ways a company embraces social responsibility include philanthropy, promoting volunteering,\u00a0and environmental changes. Companies managing their environmental impact might look to reduce their carbon footprint\u00a0and limit waste. There's also\u00a0the social responsibility of ethical practices for employees, which can mean offering a fair wage, which arises when there are limited employee protection laws.\u00a0\u00a0\n", "\nNot everyone believes that businesses should have a social conscience. Economist <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/milton-friedman.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Milton Friedman</a>\u00a0stated that \"social responsibilities of business are notable for their analytical looseness and lack of rigor.\" Friedman believed that only individuals can have a sense of social responsibility. Businesses, by their very nature, cannot. Some experts believe that social responsibility defies the very point of being in business: profit above all else.\n"]}
