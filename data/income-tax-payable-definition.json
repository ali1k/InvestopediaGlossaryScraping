It is\u00a0compiled of taxes due to the government within one year. The calculation of income tax payable is according to the prevailing tax law in the company's home country.\n", "\nIncome tax payable is shown as a current liability because the debt will be\u00a0resolved\u00a0within the next year. However, any portion of income tax payable\u00a0not scheduled for\u00a0payment within the next 12 months\u00a0is classified as a long-term liability.\n", "\nIncome tax payable is one component necessary for calculating an organization's\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deferredtaxliability.asp\">deferred tax liability</a>. A deferred tax liability arises when reporting a difference between a company's income tax liability and income tax expense. The difference may be due to the timing of when the actual income tax is due.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff For example, a business may owe $1,000 in income taxes when calculated using\u00a0accounting standards. However, if upon filing,\u00a0the\u00a0company only owes $750 on the income tax return, the $250 difference will be a liability in future periods. The conflict occurs because rule differences between the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gaap.asp\">generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)</a>\u00a0cause the deferral of some liability for a future period.\n", "\nThe\u00a0taxes,\u00a0based on the\u00a0tax law\u00a0of the company's\u00a0home country,\u00a0are calculated\u00a0on their net income. The taxable rate is according to its corporate tax rate. For companies, which are due a tax credit from its taxing agency, the amount of income tax payable will decrease.\n", "\nIncome tax payable includes levies from the federal, state, and local levels. The dollar amount due is the amount that has accumulated since the company's last tax return. In general, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/payrolltax.asp\">payroll taxes</a>, property taxes, and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/salestax.asp\">sales taxes</a> are separate liabilities.\n", "\nBusinesses use\u00a0GAAP to calculate income tax expense. This figure is listed on the company's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incomestatement.asp\">income statement</a>\u00a0and is usually the last expense line item before the calculation of net income. Upon completing a federal income tax return, a business knows the actual amount of taxes owed. The amount of taxes\u00a0owed is\u00a0reflected as a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxliability.asp\">tax liability</a>.\u00a0\n", "\nGeneral accounting principals and the IRS tax code\u00a0do not treat all items the same.\u00a0This variation in accounting methods may cause a difference\u00a0between income tax expense and income tax liability because two different sets of rules govern the calculation.\u00a0\n", "\nA typical example of different\u00a0results is\u00a0when a\u00a0company depreciates\u00a0its assets. GAAP allows for numerous different methods of depreciation that all typically result in different expense amounts by the period. The IRS tax code, however, has more stringent rules pertaining to\u00a0acceptable depreciation methods. The utilization of the two different depreciation methods\u00a0creates a difference in the tax expense and tax liability.\n"]}
