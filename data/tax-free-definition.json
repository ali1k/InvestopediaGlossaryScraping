It also refers to earnings that are not taxed. The tax free status of these goods, investments, and income may incentivize individuals and business entities to increase spending or investing, resulting in economic stimulus. Tax free may also be known as tax-exempt.\n", "\nTax free purchases and investments do not incur the typical tax consequence of other purchases and investments. For instance, tax free weekends occur in many states where, once or twice a year, store purchases are not taxed, thereby, reducing the overall cost to the consumer. Frequently these sales <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tax-holiday.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tax holidays</a> occur before school starts in the Fall to incentivize spending on school supplies, clothes, computers, calculators, etc.\n", "\nGovernments will often provide a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tax-break.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tax break</a> to investors purchasing <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/government-bond.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">government bonds</a> to ensure that enough funding will be available for expenditure projects.
