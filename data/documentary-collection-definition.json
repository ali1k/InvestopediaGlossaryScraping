The exporter's bank collects funds from the importer's bank in exchange for documents releasing title to the shipped merchandise, usually after the goods arrive at the importer's location.\n", "\nDocumentary collection is so-called because the exporter receives payment from the importer in exchange for the shipping documents. Shipping documents are required for the buyer\u00a0to clear the goods through customs and take delivery. They include a commercial invoice, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/certificate-of-origin.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">certificate of origin</a>, insurance certificate, and packing list.\u00a0\n", "\nA key document in a documentary collection is the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/billofexchange.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bill of exchange</a> or draft, which is a formal demand for payment from the exporter to importer.\n", "\nDocumentary collection is less common than other forms of trade finance, such as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/letterofcredit.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">letters of credit</a> and advance payment.

This is because the buyer's bank would not release the documents needed to take possession of the goods before payment is made. At worst, the seller would have to find another buyer or pay to have the goods shipped back.\n"]}
