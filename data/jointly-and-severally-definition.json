For example, a partner with a 10% stake in a business may have a liability that is proportional to that 10% investment.\n", "\nJointly and severally is sometimes referred to as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/joint-and-several-liability.asp\">joint and several liability</a>.\n", "\nIn a legally binding document,\u00a0the term jointly and severally\u00a0clarifies the responsibility that is shared by each party to an agreement. Essentially, it states that all of those named are obligated to perform all of the actions required under the agreement.\n", "\nFor example, if a bank lends $100,000 to two people jointly and severally, both of those people are equally responsible for making sure that the total amount of the loan is repaid to the bank. If the loan is in default, the bank may choose to pursue either for repayment of the entire outstanding balance.\n", "\nIn such cases, the person who is forced to repay the loan will have some legal recourse against the other person named in the agreement, but only after the bank is repaid in full.\n", "\nJoint and several liability are also cited in laws. For example, employers are generally responsible for injuries suffered to their employees on the job. If a construction worker ruptures a pipe in a house, the homeowner and employer might be held jointly and severally liable for the damages under state law.\n", "\nThe expression jointly and severally is commonly used in the securities industry in agreements for the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underwriting.asp\">underwriting</a> of a new bond or stock issue. In such cases, the firm that agrees to sell a portion of the total issue is responsible for that agreed upon portion plus a corresponding portion of any\u00a0unsold securities.\n", "\nThus, an underwriter who has jointly and severally agreed to be responsible for selling a 30% stake in a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/newissue.asp\">new issue</a> must sell 30% of any remaining unsold portion. Each member of the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/syndicate.asp\">syndicate</a> is responsible for any leftover shares, in proportion to the size of each stake.\n"]}
