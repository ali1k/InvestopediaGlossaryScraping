A warrant's minimum value is the difference between its <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exerciseprice.asp\">exercise price</a> and the current traded price of its underlying stock.\n", "\nAlternatively, a warrant premium is the percentage difference between the cost of purchasing shares by exercising the warrant and buying them in the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/open-market.asp\">open market</a> at the current price.\n", "\nWarrants have both a price and a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/premium.asp\">premium</a>. Typically, the premium will decrease as the price of the warrant rises coupled with the decrease in the time to expiration. A warrant is <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inthemoney.asp\">in-the-money</a> when the exercise price is less than the current share price. The more in-the-money\u00a0the warrant is, the lower the warrant premium. High volatility may also cause the warrant premium to be higher.\n", "\nAs with <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp\">call options</a>, the premium can increase or decrease depending on supply and demand factors.\n", "\nFor the simple definition, the premium is the amount above\u00a0the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intrinsicvalue.asp\">intrinsic</a>, or minimum value.\n", "\nIn this\u00a0example, if the warrant price is $10, the exercise price is $25, and the current share cost is $30, then the warrant premium would be $10-( $30-$25) = $5.\n", "\nFor the second calculation, the premium, expressed as a percentage, is the difference between buying\u00a0warrant\u00a0shares vs. buying shares through the open market.\n", "\nFor example, an investor holds a warrant with a price of $10 and an exercise price of $25. The current share price is $30. The warrant premium would be [( $10+$25-$30) / $30] * 100 = 16.7%.\n", "\nWarrants tend to trade at premiums because <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trader.asp\">traders</a> believe that the underlying stock can increase in price. Therefore, the longer the time until expiration, the longer time the stock has to rise. However, as with <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option.asp\">options</a>, as expiration approaches the premium shrinks.\n", "\nA warrant is similar to an option. It gives the owner the right, but not the obligation, to buy an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underlying-security.asp\">underlying security</a> at a specific price, quantity, and at a\u00a0future time. Warrants\u00a0are unlike an option in that it is issued by a company, whereas an option is an instrument of the stock exchange. The security represented in the warrant, usually share <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equity.asp\">equity</a>, is delivered by the issuing company instead of by an investor holding the shares. Traders cannot write warrants.\n", "\nCompanies will often include warrants as part of a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ipo.asp\">new-issue offering</a> to entice investors into buying the new security.\n"]}
