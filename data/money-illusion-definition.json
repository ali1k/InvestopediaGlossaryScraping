In other words, it is assumed that people do not take into account the level of\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"5\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp\">inflation</a>\u00a0in an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"6\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economy.asp\">economy</a>, wrongly believing that a dollar is worth the same as it was the prior year.\n", "\nMoney illusion is sometimes also referred to as price illusion.\n", "\nMoney illusion is a psychological matter that is debated among <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economist.asp\">economists</a>. Some disagree with the theory, arguing that people automatically think of their money in real terms, adjusting for inflation because they see price changes every time they enter a store.\n", "\nOther economists, meanwhile, claim that money illusion is rife, citing factors such as a lack of financial education, and the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price_stickiness.asp\">price stickiness</a>\u00a0seen in many goods and services as reasons why people might fall into the trap of ignoring the rising cost of living.\n", "\nMoney illusion is often cited as a reason why small levels of inflation\u20141% to\u00a02%\u00a0per year\u2014are actually desirable for an economy. Low inflation allows employers, for example, to modestly raise wages in nominal terms without actually paying more in real terms. As a result, many people who get pay raises believe that their wealth is increasing, regardless of the actual rate of inflation.\n", "\nIt is interesting to note how money illusion\u00a0colors\u00a0people's perceptions of financial outcomes. For example, experiments have shown that people generally perceive a\u00a02% pay\u00a0cut in nominal income with no change in monetary value as unfair. However, they also perceive\u00a0a 2%\u00a0rise in nominal income, when inflation is running at 4%, as fair.\n", "\nThe term money illusion was first coined by American economist Irving Fisher in his book \u201cStabilizing the Dollar.\u201d Fisher later wrote an entire book dedicated to the topic in 1928, titled \u201cThe Money Illusion.\u201d\n", "\nBritish economist <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/john_maynard_keynes.asp\">John Maynard Keynes</a> is credited for helping to popularize the term.\n", "\nMoney illusion is understood to be a key aspect in the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/milton-friedman.asp\">Friedmanian</a><strong> </strong>version of the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/phillipscurve.asp\">Phillips curve</a>\u2014a popular tool for analyzing <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/macroeconomics.asp\">macro-economic</a> policy. The Philips curve claims that <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economicgrowth.asp\">economic growth</a>\u00a0is accompanied by inflation, which in turn should lead to more jobs and less <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"5\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unemployment.asp\">unemployment</a>.\u00a0\n", "\nMoney illusion helps to sustain that theory. It argues that employees seldom demand an increase in wages to compensate for inflation, making it easier for firms to hire staff on the cheap. Still, money illusion doesn't adequately\u00a0account for\u00a0the mechanism at work in the Phillips curve.\u00a0To do so\u00a0requires two additional assumptions.\n", "\nFirst, prices respond differently to modified demand conditions: an increase in\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aggregatedemand.asp\">aggregate demand</a> affects\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commodity.asp\">commodity</a> prices sooner than it affects <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/labor-market.asp\">labor\u00a0market</a> prices. Thus, a\u00a0drop in unemployment is, after all, an outcome of\u00a0decreasing real wages and an accurate judgment of the situation by employees is the only reason for the return to an initial (natural) rate of unemployment (i.e. the end of the money illusion, when they finally recognize the actual dynamics of prices and wages).\n", "\nThe other (arbitrary) assumption relates specifically to\u00a0special <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asymmetricinformation.asp\">informational asymmetry</a>: whatever employees are unaware of, in connection with the changes in (real and nominal) wages and prices, can be clearly observed by employers. The new classical version of the Phillips curve was aimed at removing the puzzling additional presumptions, but its mechanism still requires money illusion.\n"]}
