Measuring and quantifying risk often allows investors, traders, and business managers to hedge some risks away by using various strategies including diversification and derivative positions.\n", "\nWhile it is true that no investment is fully free of all possible risks, certain securities have so little practical risk that they are considered risk-free or riskless.\n", "\nRiskless securities often form a baseline for analyzing and measuring risk.

Market risk\u00a0is the risk of losing investments due to factors, such as\u00a0political risk and macroeconomic risk, that affect the performance of the overall market. Market risk\u00a0cannot be easily mitigated through portfolio diversification. Other common types of systematic risk can include interest rate risk, inflation risk, currency risk, liquidity risk, country risk, and sociopolitical risk.\n", "\nUnsystematic risk, also known as specific risk or idiosyncratic risk, is a category of risk that only affects an industry or a particular company. Unsystematic risk is the risk of losing an investment due to company or industry-specific hazard. Examples include a change in management, a product recall, a regulatory change that could drive down company sales, and a new competitor in the marketplace with the potential to take away market share from a company. Investors often use diversification to manage unsystematic risk by investing in a variety of assets.\n", "\nIn addition to the broad systematic and unsystematic risks, there are several specific types of risk, including:\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/businessrisk.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Business risk</a>\u00a0refers to the basic viability of a business\u2014the question of whether a company will be able to make sufficient sales and generate sufficient revenues to cover its operational expenses and turn a profit. While financial risk is concerned with the costs of financing, business risk is concerned with all the other expenses a business must cover to remain operational and functioning. These expenses include salaries, production costs, facility rent, office, and administrative expenses. The level of a company's business risk is influenced by factors such as the cost of goods, profit margins, competition, and the overall level of demand for the products or services that it sells.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditrisk.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Credit risk</a>\u00a0is the risk that a borrower will be unable to pay the contractual interest or principal on its debt obligations.
