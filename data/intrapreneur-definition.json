They are given the time and freedom to develop the project as an entrepreneur would.\n", "\nHowever, they are not working solo. Intrapreneurs have the resources and capabilities of the firm at their disposal.\n", "\nIntrapreneurs\u00a0and entrepreneurs have different objectives. An <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/entrepreneur.asp\">entrepreneur</a> envisions creating a company from the ground up.

The intrapreneur typically has directly applicable skills and experience to bring to the job.\n", "\nAn entrepreneur starts a company as a means of providing a good or service. An intrapreneur explores policies, technologies, or applications that will help improve the performance of an existing company. Inevitably, as an intrapreneur develops the skills needed to recognize and solve important problems, that intrapreneur may turn into an entrepreneur.\n", "\nAn intrapreneur can expect to be given the freedom and autonomy needed for such a project.

Despite the growth of Internet retail, the majority of consumer purchases are still made within 15 miles of a consumer\u2019s home. Many eBay retailers told Cypher they wanted a physical retail presence as well.\n", "\nAfter consulting with eBay\u2019s\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/ceo.asp\">chief executive officer</a>\u00a0(CEO), Cypher assembled a team of engineers to develop tools that could be used to create an eBay presence in physical stores. The engineers created an interactive storefront that Toys'R'Us eventually installed. Over the following two years, the engineers did the same for TOMS, Sony, and Rebecca Minkoff.\n", "\nCypher\u2019s success became a new division of eBay, giving workers autonomy for solving problems and moving the company forward.
