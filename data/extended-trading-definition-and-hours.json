For example, a stock may have closed at $57, yet placing a bid to buy at $56 or $55 may get triggered in extended trading since there are fewer bids out and if someone wants to sell they may sell to $56 or $55 even though the price was $57 only minutes ago. The stock may even fill orders at $54 and $60, for example, before <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/openingprice.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">opening</a> the next day around $57 again.\n", "\nThe ability to trade during extended hours also gives investors and traders the opportunity to react instantly to the news which comes out when the exchange is closed. If a company reports poor <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earnings.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">earnings</a>, the stock will likely start to drop and the trader can exit their position sooner, rather than having to wait for the exchange to open. By the time the exchange opens a lot more selling could have taken place, and the price could be much lower.\n", "\nThe following chart shows the extended trading session on Twitter Inc. (TWTR) on a typical day with no major company announcements.\n", "\nThe stock closes for trading on the exchange at 4:00 pm. Prior to 4:00, the one-minute chart is active, with price movement every minute of the trading day. There is also volume associated with each one of those one-minute price bars.\n", "\nAfter 4:00, the volume drops off dramatically. Some of the price bars also appear as dots, because there was a transaction at only one price level during that one-minute period. There are <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gap.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">gaps</a> between the dots (and some price bars) because the price may change even though transactions haven't taken place. This is because there are fewer bids and offers, and so as the bids and offers change, that may entice or scare someone into transacting at the new bid or offer.\n", "\nThe last transaction of the evening occurs at 7:55 p.m., in this example. The first transaction, in this example, occurs at 7:28 a.m the following morning. The price is trading higher than the prior <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/closingprice.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">close price</a> but is quickly adjusted as the price falls more than $0.75 in minutes.
