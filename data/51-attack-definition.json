They would also be able to reverse transactions that were completed while they were in control of the network, meaning they could <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/doublespending.asp\">double-spend</a> coins.\n", "\nThey would almost certainly not be able to create new coins or alter old blocks. A 51% attack would probably not destroy bitcoin or another blockchain-based currency outright, even if it proved highly damaging.\n", "\nBitcoin and other <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cryptocurrency.asp\">cryptocurrencies</a> are based on blockchains, a form of\u00a0a distributed ledger. These digital files record every transaction made on a cryptocurrency's network and are available to all users\u2014and the general public\u2014for review. As a result, no one can spend a coin twice.\u00a0(So-called \"private blockchains\"\u00a0introduce permissions to prevent certain users in the general public from seeing all the data on a blockchain.)\n", "\nAs its name implies, a blockchain is a chain of blocks, which are bundles of data that record all completed transactions during a given period. For bitcoin, a new block is generated approximately every 10 minutes. Once a block is finalized or mined, it cannot be altered since a fraudulent version of the public ledger would quickly be spotted and rejected by the network's users.\n", "\nHowever, by controlling the majority of the computing power on the network, an attacker or group of attackers can interfere with the process of recording new blocks. They can prevent other miners from completing blocks, theoretically allowing them to monopolize the mining of new blocks and earn all of the rewards.\n", "\nFor bitcoin, the reward is currently 12.5 newly-created bitcoins, though it will eventually drop to zero. They can block other users' transactions, and they can send a transaction and then reverse it, making it appear as though they still had the coin they just spent. This vulnerability, known as double-spending, is the digital equivalent of a perfect counterfeit and the basic cryptographic hurdle the blockchain was built to overcome. So a network that allowed for double-spending would quickly suffer a loss of confidence.\n", "\nChanging historical blocks\u2014transactions locked-in before the start of the attack\u2014would be extremely difficult even in the event of a 51% attack. The further back the transactions are, the more difficult it would be to change them. It would be impossible to change transactions before a checkpoint, past which transactions are hard-coded into bitcoin's software.\n", "\nOn the other hand, a form of a 51% attack is possible with less than 50% of the network's mining power, but with a lower probability of success.\n", "\nKrypton and Shift, two blockchains based on <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ethereum.asp\">ethereum</a>, suffered 51% attacks in August 2016.\n", "\nIn May of 2018, Bitcoin Gold, at the time the 26th-largest cryptocurrency, suffered a 51% attack. The malicious actor or actors controlled a vast amount of Bitcoin Gold's hash power, such that even with Bitcoin Gold repeatedly attempting to raise the exchange thresholds, the attackers were able to double-spend for several days, eventually stealing more than $18 million worth of Bitcoin Gold.\n", "\nThe <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/news/blockchain-vs-blockless-can-iota-take-ethereum/\">tangle</a>, a distributed ledger that is fundamentally distinct from a blockchain\u00a0but designed to accomplish similar goals, could theoretically succumb to an attacker deploying over a third of the network's hash rate, referred to as a 34% attack.\n"]}
