An equity swap is similar to an interest rate swap, but rather than one leg being the \"fixed\" side, it is based on the return of an equity index. The two sets of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nominal.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">nominally</a>\u00a0equal cash flows are exchanged as per the terms of the swap, which may involve an equity-based cash flow (such as from a stock asset called the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reference-equity.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reference equity</a>) that is traded for fixed-income cash flow (such as a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/benchmark.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">benchmark</a> interest rate).\n", "\nSwaps trade over-the-counter and are very customizable based on what the two parties agree to.

For example, one party will pay the floating leg (typically linked to LIBOR) and receive the returns on a pre-agreed-upon index of stocks\u00a0relative to the notional amount of the contract. Equity swaps allow parties to potentially benefit from returns of an equity security or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/index.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">index</a>\u00a0without the need to own shares, an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">exchange-traded fund</a>\u00a0(ETF), or a mutual fund that tracks an index.\n", "\nMost equity swaps\u00a0are conducted between large financing firms such as auto financiers, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investmentbank.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">investment banks</a>, and\u00a0lending institutions. Equity swaps are typically linked to the performance of an equity security or index and include payments linked to fixed rate or floating rate securities. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/libor.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LIBOR</a> rates are a common benchmark for the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixedincome.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fixed income</a> portion of equity swaps, which\u00a0tend to be held at intervals of one year or less, much like <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commercialpaper.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">commercial paper</a>.\n", "\nThe stream of payments in an equity swap is known as the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leg.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">legs</a>. One leg is the payment stream of the performance of an equity security or equity index (such as the S&amp;P 500) over a specified period, which is based on the specified notional value. The second leg is typically based on the LIBOR, a fixed rate, or another equity's or\u00a0index's returns.\n", "\nAssume\u00a0a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/passivemanagement.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">passively managed</a> fund\u00a0seeks to track the performance of the S&amp;P 500.

However, its payment would be offset by $25 million multiplied by the percentage increase in the S&amp;P 500. If the S&amp;P 500 falls over the next year, then the fund would have to pay the investment bank the interest payment and the percentage that the S&amp;P 500 fell multiplied by $25 million. If the S&amp;P 500 rises more than LIBOR plus two basis points, the investment bank owes\u00a0the passively managed fund the difference.\n", "\nSince swaps are customizable based on what two parties agree to, there are many potential ways this swap could be restructured. Instead of LIBOR plus two basis points, we could have seen one bp, or instead of the S&amp;P 500, another index could be used.\n"]}
