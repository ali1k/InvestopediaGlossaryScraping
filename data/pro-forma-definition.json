These are often intended to be preliminary or illustrative financials that do not follow standard accounting practices. Basically, companies use their own discretion in calculating pro forma earnings, including or excluding items depending on what they feel accurately reflects the company's true performance. As pro forma forecasts are hypothetical in nature, they can deviate from actual results, sometimes significantly.\n", "\nFrom Latin, <em>pro forma </em>translates literally into \"for the sake of form.\"\n", "\nThere are no universal rules that companies must follow when reporting pro forma earnings. This is why it is important for investors to distinguish between pro forma earnings and those reported using generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). GAAP enforces strict guidelines when companies report earnings, but pro forma figures are better thought of as \"hypothetical\" earnings,\u00a0computed according to the relevance of certain events or conditions. For this reason, investors must examine not only the pro forma earnings, but also GAAP earnings, and never mistake one for the other.\n", "\nA <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pro-forma-invoice.asp\">pro forma invoice</a> is a preliminary\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bill-of-sale.asp\">bill of sale</a>\u00a0sent to buyers in advance of a shipment or delivery of goods.

A pro forma invoice requires only enough information to allow customs to determine the duties needed from a general examination of the included goods.\n", "\nMaybe, but it is not advised. Because companies' definitions of pro forma will vary along with their internal methods for forecasting and making assumptions, you must be careful when comparing pro forma figures between different companies. If you are not aware of how the companies define their pro forma figures, you may be inadvertently comparing apples to oranges.\u00a0\n"]}
