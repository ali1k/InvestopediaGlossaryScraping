In general, a lien serves to guarantee payment of a debt such as a loan, or in this case, taxes. If the obligation is not satisfied, the creditor may proceed to seize the assets.\n", "\nThe federal or state government can place a tax lien on a property if the owner is in arrears on income taxes. Local governments may place a lien on a property for nonpayment of property or local income taxes.\n", "\nThe lien does not mean that the property will be sold. Rather, it ensures that the tax authority gets the first claim over any other creditors vying for the creditor's assets.\n", "\nThe process begins when a taxpayer gets a letter that details how much is owed. This is known as a notice and demand for payment.\n", "\nIf the taxpayer fails to pay the debt or attempt to resolve it with the IRS, the agency can place a lien on the person's assets.\n", "\nThis lien attaches to all of a taxpayer\u2019s assets, including securities, property, and vehicles. Any assets the taxpayer acquires while the lien is in effect also apply. It also attaches to any business property and the accounts receivable for the business.\n", "\nIf the taxpayer chooses to file for\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bankruptcy.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bankruptcy</a>, the lien and the tax debt could\u00a0continue even after the bankruptcy. Most debts are wiped out by bankruptcy proceedings, but not federal tax debt.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\u00a0\n", "\nIn the U.S., the IRS may place a lien against a taxpayer's home, vehicle, and bank accounts if federal tax payments are delinquent and there has been no demonstrated effort to pay the taxes owed.\n", "\nA federal tax lien\u00a0has precedence over all other creditors' claims. It also makes it difficult for the taxpayer to sell the assets or to obtain credit.\n", "\nThe only way to release a federal tax lien is to fully pay the tax owed or reach a settlement with the IRS.\n", "\nOnce a lien has been filed, it used to show up on the taxpayer's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditreport.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">credit report</a>, damaging the person's credit score. This could also prevent the taxpayer from selling or refinancing any assets to which liens have been attached. Note that since 2018, the 3 major credit reporting agencies have stopped including tax liens on credit reports.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nThe lien will remain in place until the tax bill is resolved or the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/statute-of-limitations.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">statute of limitations</a> on the debt expires.\n", "\nThe IRS has the authority to seize the assets of a taxpayer who ignores a tax lien.\n", "\nThe simplest way to get out of a federal tax lien is to pay the taxes owed. However, if this is not possible, there are other ways to deal with a lien with the cooperation of the IRS.\n", "\nIf repaying the taxes is simply impossible, the taxpayer must pay as much of the debt as possible and seek dismissal of the balance in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bankruptcy-court.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bankruptcy court</a>.\n", "\nIf the taxes remain unpaid, the tax authority can use a tax levy to legally seize the taxpayer's assets in order to collect the money it is owed.\n", "\nWhile a lien secures the government\u2019s interest or claim in the property, a levy permits the government to seize and sell the property in order to pay the tax debt.\n", "\nTax liens are publicly recorded. After a tax debtor pays off the debt, the county records will be updated to reflect the fact that the lien has been released.\n"]}
