For example, an acre of land in a rural setting may not contribute as much to the surrounding economy as the same sized plot in a downtown urban location, where the location might be next to a new food distribution center needing an additional loading dock.\n", "\nFrom the earliest times, land has been seen by societies\u00a0as an asset that cannot\u00a0be owned by an individual in the traditional sense of ownership,\u00a0but rather something to be treated\u00a0as a rental passing from generation to generation. It is the human activity undertaken on a parcel of land that largely determines its overall value, and that activity is almost always linked to the wealth of the landowner, so a land value tax\u00a0is viewed as a fairer basis for determining tax\u00a0liability. This has led us to our modern-day system of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assessor.asp\">assessing</a>\u00a0land and buildings separately for taxation purposes.\u00a0\n", "\nLVT is also known as a site valuation tax, an example of an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/advaloremtax.asp\">ad valorem tax</a>.\u00a0Ad Valorem is the Latin phrase meaning \u201caccording to value.\u201d<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"5\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff Modern examples of these are most commonly found in the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assessedvalue.asp\">municipal land assessments</a> homeowners receive annually, in which their land is valued separately from the various buildings on their land.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"6\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff A homeowner can make\u00a0improvements to the buildings on the land, changing the taxable value. But the land itself tends to maintain a more stable value over time.\u00a0The opposite is also true in the case of\u00a0a landowner who lets his buildings fall into disrepair. In this case, the overall property taxes paid to the community will be less than before, yet the land itself maintains more or less its original worth, which will be important when a potential buyer is considering their tax burden and the real value of what they are purchasing.\n", "\nChanges in property values are largely determined by market swings and can be extremely volatile. These changes create what economists call <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deadweightloss.asp\">deadweight loss</a>, which is the measure of the loss to society at large.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff These losses have far-reaching adverse effects in funding the basic services any prosperous society needs, such as police, fire and rescue.\n", "\nThe land value tax helps mitigate these market swings by separating the more stable value of the land from the buildings in creating a manageable system for real estate taxation.\n"]}
