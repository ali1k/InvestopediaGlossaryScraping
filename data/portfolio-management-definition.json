The choices involve trade-offs, from debt versus equity to domestic versus international and growth versus safety.\n", "\nProfessional licensed <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/wealth-management/021816/portfolio-manager-job-description-average-salary.asp\">portfolio managers</a> work on behalf of clients, while individuals may choose to build and manage their own portfolios. In either case, the portfolio manager's ultimate goal is to maximize the investments' expected return within an appropriate level of risk exposure.\n", "\nPortfolio management may be either passive or active in nature.\n", "\nThe key to effective portfolio management is the long-term mix of assets. Generally, that means stocks, bonds, and \"cash\" such as certificates of deposit. There are others, often referred to as alternative investments, such as real estate, commodities, and derivatives.\n", "\nAsset allocation is based on the understanding that different types of assets do not move in concert, and some are more volatile than others. A mix of assets provides balance and protects against risk.\n", "\nInvestors with a more aggressive profile weight their portfolios toward more volatile investments such as growth stocks. Investors with a conservative profile weight their portfolios toward stabler investments such as bonds and blue-chip stocks.\n", "\nThe only certainty in investing is that it is impossible to consistently predict winners and losers. The prudent approach is to create a basket of investments that provides broad exposure within an asset class.\n", "\nDiversification is spreading risk and reward within an asset class. Because it is difficult to know which subset of an asset class or sector is likely to outperform another, diversification seeks to capture the returns of all of the sectors over time while reducing volatility at any given time.\n", "\nReal diversification is made across various classes of securities, sectors of the economy, and geographical regions.\n", "\nRebalancing is used to return a portfolio to its original target allocation at regular intervals, usually annually. This is done to reinstate the original asset mix when the movements of the markets force it out of kilter.\n", "\nFor example, a portfolio that starts out with a 70% equity and 30% fixed-income allocation could, after an extended market rally, shift to an 80/20 allocation. The investor has made a good profit, but the portfolio now has more risk than the investor can tolerate.\n", "\nRebalancing generally involves selling high-priced securities and putting that money to work in lower-priced and out-of-favor securities.\n", "\nThe annual exercise of rebalancing allows the investor to capture gains and expand the opportunity for growth in high potential sectors while keeping the portfolio aligned with the original risk/return profile.\n", "\nInvestors who implement an active management approach use fund managers or brokers to buy and sell stocks in an attempt to outperform a specific index, such as the\u00a0Standard &amp; Poor's 500\u00a0Index or the Russell 1000 Index.\n", "\nAn actively managed investment fund has an individual portfolio\u00a0manager, co-managers, or a team of managers actively making investment decisions for the fund. The success of an actively managed fund depends on a combination of in-depth research, market forecasting, and the expertise of the portfolio manager or management team.\n", "\nPortfolio managers engaged in active investing pay close attention to market trends, shifts in the economy, changes to the political landscape, and news that affects companies. This data is used to time the purchase or sale of investments in an effort to take advantage of irregularities. Active managers claim that these processes will boost\u00a0the potential for returns higher than those achieved by simply mimicking the holdings on a particular index.\n", "\nTrying to beat the market inevitably involves additional\u00a0market risk. Indexing eliminates this particular risk, as there is no possibility of human error in terms of stock selection. Index funds are also traded less frequently, which means that they incur lower expense ratios and are more tax-efficient than actively managed funds.\n", "\nPassive portfolio management, also referred to as\u00a0index fund\u00a0management, aims to duplicate the return of a particular\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketindex.asp\">market index</a>\u00a0or benchmark.\u00a0Managers buy the same stocks that are listed on the index, using the same weighting that they represent in the index.\n", "\nA passive strategy portfolio can be structured as an exchange-traded fund (ETF), a mutual fund, or a\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/uit.asp\">unit investment trust</a>. Index funds are branded as passively managed because each has a portfolio manager whose job is to replicate the index rather than select the assets purchased or sold.\n", "\nThe\u00a0management fees\u00a0assessed on passive portfolios or funds are typically far lower than active management strategies.\n"]}
