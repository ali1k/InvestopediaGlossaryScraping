Excluded from the square footage calculation are unoccupied areas such as basements, parking garages, stairs, and elevator shafts.\n", "\nBuildings with different numbers of stories may have the same floor-area-ratio value. Every city has a limited capacity or limited space that can be utilized safely. Any use beyond this point puts undue stress on a city. This is sometimes known as the safe load factor.\n", "\nThe floor area ratio is variable because <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/population.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">population</a> dynamics, growth patterns, and construction activities vary and because the nature of the land or space where a building is placed varies.

In the end, local governments establish regulations and restrictions that determine the floor area ratio.\n", "\nThe floor area ratio is a key determining factor for development in any country. A low floor area ratio is generally a deterrent to construction.

An increased floor area ratio allows a developer to complete more building projects, which inevitably leads to greater sales, decreased expenditures per project, and greater <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/11/intro-supply-demand.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">supply to meet demand</a>.\n", "\nThough the floor area ratio calculates the size of the building relative to the lot, the lot coverage takes into account the size of all buildings and structures. The lot coverage ratio includes structures such as garages, swimming pools, and sheds\u2014including nonconforming buildings.\n", "\nThe impact that the floor area ratio has on land value cuts both ways.
