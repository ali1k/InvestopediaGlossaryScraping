It is an important insurance component for properties that are not occupied during well-known periods of the day, such as churches and schools. These structures can become target when they are unoccupied because vandals know there is a reduced risk of being caught.\n", "\nDue to the risk and frequency of loss, this coverage typically carries a higher <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deductible.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">deductible</a> for properties that are known to be unoccupied for certain hours of the day, including churches and schools. Vandalism and mischief are described as the intentional injury or destruction of property. Vandalism and malicious mischief can be written as an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/endorsement.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">endorsement</a> to a standard policy, such as the standard fire policy, in the event that the policy requires a separate endorsement for this type of coverage.\n", "\nVandalism\u00a0is damage done to someone else\u2019s property, simply for the sake of causing damage.\u00a0It is one of the most common property crimes. Malicious mischief is similar, though the damage may not have been\u00a0intended.\u00a0Some situations, like egging a\u00a0house, straddle the line, depending on the outcome.\n", "\nThe peril of vandalism or malicious mischief covers damage to parts of the premises for which you\u2019re responsible, as well as to personal property.\u00a0If, for example, someone slashes the tires of your bike, which is stored on the property, that\u2019s vandalism.\u00a0If someone thinks your music is too loud and\u00a0sneaks into your home to destroy your stereo, that, too, is vandalism.\u00a0Both would likely be covered losses if they met your deductible.\n", "\nWhat type of vandalism most commonly results in an insurance claim?\u00a0Damage inflicted by angry ex-husbands/wives/partners.\u00a0Often fueled by alcohol, exes have been known to\u00a0take revenge on a former spouse by causing property damage and destruction.\u00a0If your ex comes into your home and trashes it, that\u2019s vandalism, and it's usually covered.\n", "\nVandalism or malicious mischief losses are not covered if a\u00a0dwelling has been vacant for over\u00a060 consecutive days.\u00a0A structure is vacant is no one is living there and it\u2019s substantially empty of personal property necessary for normal use.\n", "\nVandalism committed by any of the insured\u00a0is also not covered.\u00a0What does this mean?\u00a0Imagine that you live with a partner who is a named insured on your\u00a0policy.\u00a0Things go south and they move out, but you neglect to have the policy rewritten.\u00a0That means they\u2019re still insured under the policy.\u00a0If they return and trash the place, reimbursement would likely be denied because it\u2019s an intentional act committed by one insured against another.\n"]}
