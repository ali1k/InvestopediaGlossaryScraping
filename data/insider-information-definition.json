Buying or selling stock based on insider information can be a criminal offense.\n", "\nInsider\u00a0information is usually available to executives working within or close to a public company.\n", "\nA limited number of people inside a company inevitably know about an event that will, once it is revealed, will significantly affect the company's stock price. It might be a pending merger, a product recall, a shortfall in earnings, or the failure of a major project. In extreme cases, it might be a financial scandal that is about to burst into public view.\n", "\nThe people who are in the know are not just sworn to confidentiality. They are forbidden by law to take advantage of that knowledge by buying or selling stock in the company, or by passing along the information to someone else who takes advantage of it.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insidertrading.asp\">Insider trading</a> is illegal when the material information has not been made public and has been traded on. It is\u00a0seen as an unfair manipulation of the free market to give an advantage to certain parties. Ultimately, it undermines confidence in the integrity of the market and can dampen economic growth.\u00a0\n", "\nA person who uses insider information to place trades, or advises a third party to place trades based on the information, can be found guilty of insider trading.\n", "\nObviously, company insiders own stock and they buy and sell shares from time to time.

It stipulates that any time a firm is disclosing previously non-public information to an interested party, they must make that information public and available to all traders.\n", "\nThe SEC prosecutes trading based on insider information\u00a0as a serious fraud crime and individuals found guilty can be heavily fined or imprisoned.
