Financial advisors (sometimes spelled as advisers) can provide many different services, such as investment management, tax planning, and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/estateplanning.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">estate planning</a>. Increasingly, financial advisors are acting as a \"one-stop-shop\" by providing everything from portfolio management to insurance products.\n", "\nRegistered advisors must carry the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/series65.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Series 65</a> license to conduct business with the public.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff A wide variety of other <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/091815/do-financial-advisors-have-be-licensed.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">licenses</a> and certifications may be required depending on the services provided by a given financial advisor.\n", "\nFinancial advisor is a generic term with no precise industry definition. As a result, this title can describe many different types of financial professionals. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockbroker.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stockbrokers</a>, insurance agents, tax preparers, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investment-manager.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">investment managers</a>, and financial planners can all be considered financial advisors. Estate planners and bankers may also fall under this umbrella.\n", "\nStill, an important distinction can be made: that is, a financial advisor must actually provide guidance and advice<em>.</em> A financial advisor can be distinguished from an execution stock broker that simply places trades for clients or a tax accountant who simply prepares tax returns without providing advice on how to maximize tax advantages.\n", "\nFurthermore, what may pass as a financial advisor in some instances may simply be a product salesperson, such as a stockbroker or a life insurance agent. A true financial advisor should be a well-educated, credentialed, experienced, financial professional who works on behalf of his clients, as opposed to serving the interests of a financial institution by maximizing the sales of certain products or capitalizing on commissions from sales.\n", "\nGenerally, a financial advisor is an independent practitioner who operates in a fiduciary capacity in which a client\u2019s interests come before their own. However, only <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/ria.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Registered Investment Advisors</a> (RIAs), who are governed by the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investadvact.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Investment Advisers Act of 1940</a>, are held to a true fiduciary standard. This\u00a0fiduciary standard\u00a0mandates that an\u00a0RIA\u00a0must always unconditionally put the client's best interests ahead of their own, regardless of all other circumstances.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff There are some agents and brokers who elect to practice in this capacity, as a fiduciary, as a way of attracting clients. However, their compensation structure is such that they are bound by the contracts of the companies where they work.\n", "\nSince the enactment of the Investment Adviser Act of 1940, two types of relationships have existed between financial intermediaries and their clients. These are the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reasonableness-standard.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reasonableness standard</a> and the stricter <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiduciary.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fiduciary standard</a>. These relationships characterize the nature of the transactions between registered representatives and clients in the broker-dealer space. There is a fiduciary relationship that requires advisors registered with the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) as Registered Investment Advisors to exercise duties of loyalty, care, and full disclosure in their interactions with clients.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff\n", "\nWhile the former is based on the principle of \"<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/caveatemptor.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">caveat emptor</a>\" guided by self-governed rules of \"suitability\" and \"reasonableness\" in recommending an investment product or strategy, the latter is grounded in federal laws that impose the highest ethical standards. At its core, the fiduciary relationship relies on the necessity that a financial advisor must act on behalf of a client in a way the client would act for himself if he had the requisite knowledge and skills to do so.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff\n", "\nThe financial planner is one particular type of financial advisor who specializes in helping companies and individuals create a program to meet long-term financial goals.\n", "\nA financial planner might have a specialty in investments, taxes, retirement, and/or estate planning.
