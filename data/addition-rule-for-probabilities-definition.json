Since the chances of selecting a girl are 11 in 20, the chances of selecting a B student are 9 in 20\u00a0and the chances of selecting a girl who is a B student are 5/20, the chances of picking a girl or a B student are:\n", "\nIn reality, the two rules simplify to just one rule, the second one. That's because in the first case, the probability of two mutually exclusive events both happening is 0. In the example with the die, it's impossible to roll both a 3 and a 6 on one roll of a single die. So the two events are mutually exclusive.\n", "\nMutually exclusive is a statistical term describing two or more events that cannot coincide. It is commonly used to describe a situation where the occurrence of one outcome supersedes the other. \u00a0For a basic example, consider the rolling of dice. You cannot roll both a five and a three simultaneously on a single die. Furthermore, getting a three on an initial roll has no impact on whether or not a subsequent roll yields a five. All rolls of a die are independent events.\n"]}
