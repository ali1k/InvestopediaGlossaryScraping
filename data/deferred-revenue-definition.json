The company that receives the prepayment records the amount as deferred revenue, a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liability.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">liability</a>, on its\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancesheet.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">balance sheet</a>.\n", "\nDeferred revenue is a liability because it reflects revenue that has not been earned and represents products or services that are owed to a customer. As the product or service is delivered over time, it is recognized proportionally as revenue on the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incomestatement.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">income statement</a>.\n", "\nDeferred revenue is recognized as a liability on the balance sheet of a company that receives an\u00a0advance payment. This is because it has an obligation to the customer in the form of the products or services owed. The payment\u00a0is considered a liability to the company because there is still the possibility that\u00a0the good or service may\u00a0not be delivered, or the buyer might\u00a0cancel the\u00a0order. In either\u00a0case, the\u00a0company would need to\u00a0repay the customer, unless other payment terms were explicitly stated in a signed contract.\n", "\nContracts can stipulate different terms,\u00a0whereby\u00a0it's possible that no revenue may be recorded\u00a0until all of the services or products have been delivered.

Accounting conservatism ensures the company is reporting the lowest possible profit. A company reporting revenue conservatively will only recognize earned revenue when it has completed certain tasks to have full claim to the money and once the likelihood of payment is certain.\n", "\nTypically, as a company delivers services or products, deferred revenue is gradually recognized on the income statement to the extent the revenue is \"earned.\" Categorizing deferred\u00a0revenue as earned\u00a0revenue too quickly, or simply bypassing the deferred revenue account all together and posting it directly to revenue on the income statement, is considered\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aggressiveaccounting.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">aggressive accounting</a>\u00a0and effectively\u00a0overstates sales revenue.\n", "\nDeferred revenue is typically reported as a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentliabilities.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">current liability</a> on a company's balance sheet, as prepayment terms are typically for 12 months or less. However, if a customer made an up-front prepayment for services that are expected to be delivered over several years, the portion of the payment that pertains to services or products to be provided after 12 months from the payment date should be classified as deferred revenue under the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/longtermliabilities.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">long-term liability</a> section of the balance sheet.\n", "\nDeferred revenue is common with subscription-based products or services that require prepayments.

Monthly, the accountant records a debit entry to the deferred revenue account, and a credit entry to the sales revenue account for $100. By the end of the fiscal year, the entire deferred revenue balance of $1,200 has been gradually booked as revenue on the income statement at the rate of $100 per month. The balance is now $0 in the deferred revenue account until next year's prepayment is made.\n"]}
