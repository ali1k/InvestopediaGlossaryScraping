Income properties, which are also called <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"5\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investment-property.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">investment properties</a>, may be either residential or commercial.\n", "\nAn income property can be a good <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/real-estate-investing-guide/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">investment</a> for a variety of reasons.

But income properties require a great deal of analysis to ensure that steady cash flow is available throughout the life of the loan and beyond. Determining a base rate of income to rents is often important in order to determine the desired <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rateofreturn.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">rate of return</a> (RoR). One way to do this is by analyzing the current rental rate on similar properties in the area while factoring in the monthly payments required for the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortgage.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mortgage</a>.\n", "\nBecause the costs to maintain an income property may be high, property owners should consider having a financial cushion on which to fall back in cases of emergency. This includes being able to pay for repairs, regular maintenance, or other costs they are <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liability.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">liable</a> for on the building like <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/propertytax.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">property taxes</a> and utilities. Managing the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashflow.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cash flow</a> and ensuring that it exceeds the cost of borrowing and expenses helps to increase the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/return.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">return</a> on the owner's investment.\n", "\nAs mentioned above, income properties can be both commercial and residential.

Residential properties, on the other hand, are used primarily for personal use by people other than the owner. Residential income properties may be single or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/041216/3-reasons-invest-multifamily-real-estate.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">multifamily homes</a>, condominiums, townhomes, apartments, or seasonal homes such as cottages.\n", "\nIncome properties may be part of primary residences or additional properties owned by an investor. In some cases, the homeowner rents out a portion of their own home\u2014say, their basement or the upper level of the property\u2014in order to produce income while maintaining a residence there. This is called an owner-occupied income property, meaning both the owner/<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/landlord.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">landlord</a> and the tenant live in the same property.

Investors interested in income-producing real estate generally need to have high credit scores and steady incomes in order to prove they can make monthly installment payments. For many investors, the most common type of loan for a real estate property will be a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/021016/complete-guide-financing-investment-property.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">conventional bank loan</a>.\n", "\nIn order to qualify, the investor needs to make a formal <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-application.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">credit application</a>.

With a fix and flip property, the income property owner believes the resale value after renovations will cover the cost of interest on the loan and renovation expenses, generating an immediate positive return when sold.
