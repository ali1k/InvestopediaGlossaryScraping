Leaders of member countries, the United States, the United Kingdom (U.K.), Canada, Germany, Japan, Italy, France, and until recently, Russia, meet periodically to address international economic and monetary issues.\n", "\nIn 2014, Russia was suspended\u00a0indefinitely from the group after annexing Crimea, an autonomous republic of Ukraine. As a result, the G-8 is now referred to as the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/g7.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">G-7</a>.\n", "\nThe G-8 was considered global policymaking at its highest level. Member nations wielded significant power, as their combined wealth and resources comprised roughly half of the entire <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economy.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">global economy</a>. Leaders from the G-8 nations, including presidents, prime ministers, cabinet members, and economic advisors, would assemble in this forum to exchange ideas, brainstorm solutions, and discuss innovative strategies that will benefit each individual nation, as well as the world as a whole.\n", "\nThe group's members occasionally worked together to help resolve global problems. In the past, they have discussed <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-crisis.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">financial crises</a>, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monetarypolicy.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">monetary</a> systems, and major world crises\u00a0like oil shortages, terrorism, and climate change.\n", "\nWhile the current G-7 holds significant sway, it is not an official, formal entity like the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/united-nations-un.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">United Nations</a> (UN) and therefore has no legislative or authoritative power. The goal is to find solutions to pressing issues and increase international cooperation, compiling recommended policies and plans that its members can work collaboratively to implement. None of the agreements reached, however, are legally binding.\n", "\nThe origins of the group date back to the early 1970s, when leaders of the U.S., U.K., France, West Germany, Italy, and Japan met informally in Paris to discuss the then <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/recession.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">recession</a> and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/1979-energy-crisis.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">oil crisis</a>. Over the years, new members joined, starting with Canada in 1976 and then Russia in 1997. This lineup of eight countries remained active for 17 years until Russia was expelled in 2014.\n", "\nRussia was suspended from the group after other members disagreed with its annexation of Crimea, an autonomous republic of Ukraine. By 2017, Russia announced its intention to permanently withdraw from the G-8, bringing the number of active members down to seven.\n", "\nWithout Russia, the G-8 has become the G-7. However, there is still a chance that Russia could rejoin the group again.\n", "\nFormer U.S. President Donald Trump actively campaigned to readmit Russia to the organization. French President Emmanuel Macron appeared to be in agreement with this idea, who pleaded for Russian President Vladimir Putin to be invited to the G-7 conference in 2020. However, the meeting was canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n", "\nAnti-<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalism.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">capitalism</a> and anti-<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/globalization.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">globalization</a> protests, some of which have turned violent, have become a prominent fixture at G-8 and G-7 summits. Critics often describe the group as a type of rich countries' club that disregards poor nations in favor of pursuing their own interests.\n", "\nA lot of complaints in the past have centered around the exclusion of representatives from <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/emergingmarketeconomy.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">emerging</a> and developing nations. Critics point out these economies play an increasingly important role in the global marketplace yet continue to be shunned by the old guard.\n", "\nLately, there have been some changes. The U.K. and France pushed to include five emerging economies into the group\u2014Brazil, China, India, Mexico, and South Africa. These countries are sometimes now involved in talks, leading those particular meetings to be referred to as G-8+5.\n", "\nMeanwhile, in 1999, a separate intergovernmental organization, known as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/g-20.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">G-20</a>, was founded, consisting of the G-7 members, the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/europeanunion.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">European Union</a> (EU), plus\u00a012 other nations:\n", "\nThe G-20 has the mandate to promote global <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economicgrowth.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">economic growth</a>, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/insights/what-is-international-trade/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">international trade</a>, and regulation of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-market.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">financial markets</a>.\n"]}
