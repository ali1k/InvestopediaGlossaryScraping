It may involve a reduction in the interest rate, an extension of the length of time for repayment, a different type of loan, or any combination of the three.\n", "\nSuch changes usually are made because the borrower is unable to repay the original loan. Most successful loan modification processes are negotiated with the help of an attorney or a settlement company. Some borrowers are eligible for government assistance in loan modification.\n", "\nAlthough a loan modification may be made for any type of loan, they are most common with secured loans such as mortgages.\n", "\nA lender may agree to a loan modification during a settlement procedure or in the case of a potential foreclosure. In such situations, the lender has concluded that a loan modification will be less costly to the business than a foreclosure or a charge-off of the debt.\n", "\nA loan modification agreement is not the same as a forbearance agreement.

These include:\n", "\nSome traditional lenders have their own loan modification programs.\n", "\nA mortgage loan modification application will require the details of a borrower's financial information, the mortgage information, and the specifics of the hardship situation.\n", "\nEach program will have its own qualifications and requirements. These are typically based on the amount the borrower owes, the property being used for collateral, and specific features of the collateral property.\n", "\nIf a borrower is approved, the approval will include an offer with new loan modification terms.\n"]}
