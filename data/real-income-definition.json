Individuals often closely track their nominal vs. real income to have the best understanding of their purchasing power.\n", "\nOverall, real income is only an estimate of an individual\u2019s purchasing power since the formula for calculating real income uses a broad collection of goods that may or may not closely match the categories an investor spends within. Moreover, entities may not spend all of their nominal income, avoiding some of the real income\u2019s effects.\n", "\nThere are several ways to calculate real income. Three basic real income formulas include the following:\n", "\nAll real income/real wage formulas can integrate one of several inflation measures. Three of the most popular inflation measures for consumers include:\n", "\nGenerally, the three main price indexes will report relatively the same level of inflation. However, analysts of real income can choose any price index measure that they believe best fits their income analysis situation.\n", "\nMany individuals and businesses invest a significant portion of their income in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/121515/8-high-risk-investments-could-double-your-money.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">risk-free investment products</a> and vehicles that match or exceed the economic inflation rate in order to mitigate the effects of inflation on their income.\n", "\nThere are several risk-free investments that offer a return of approximately 2% or more. These products include <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/09/high-yield-savings-account.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">high yield</a> savings accounts, money market accounts, certificates of deposit, Treasuries, and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tips.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities</a> (TIPS).\n", "\nBeyond that, investors may be willing to take on slightly more risk in order to keep their income yielding at or above inflation. For more sophisticated investors, municipal and corporate <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bonds</a> are often used for obtaining 2%+ returns, beating inflation, and helping income to grow steadily over time.\n", "\nWhen following real wages, there may be several statistics to consider. A real wage rate can be a basic calculation of an individual\u2019s hourly, weekly, or annual rate after adjusting for inflation.\n", "\nThe BLS publishes a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www.bls.gov/bls/news-release/realer.htm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">monthly real earnings report</a>, which can be helpful in keeping tabs on real wage rates. The \u201cJanuary 2021 Real Earnings\u201d report, for example, shows the real average hourly earnings rate across all surveyed workers on private <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nonfarmpayroll.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">nonfarm payrolls</a> at $11.43 per hour\u2014a 4% increase on January 2020.\n", "\nThe comprehensive BLS report has been created using special methodologies. Individuals looking to calculate their own real wage rate may be better served by adapting the above real income formulas to their own individual situation.\n", "\nFor example, a mid-level manager with a nominal $60,000 per year salary might follow the CPI to calculate their real hourly, weekly, monthly, and annual wage rate. Suppose the CPI reported an inflation rate of 2.4%. Using the simple formula [Wages / (1 + Inflation Rate) = Real Income], this would result in an approximate real wage rate of $58,594\u2014relative to the period in which the $60,000 was calculated.\n", "\nCalculating real wage rates on an hourly, weekly, and monthly basis can be more complex but still attempted. The mid-level manager could divide his nominal annual wage by the number of hours, weeks, and months per year with a subsequent adjustment. For a monthly assessment, a $60,000 per year salary would translate to $5,000 in nominal pay per month. Adjusting that by the CPI\u2019s monthly change, let's say of -0.01%, the $5,000 would have increased its purchasing power to $5,005.\n", "\nOther takes on the real wage rate might look at the percentage of real to nominal wages or the real vs. nominal wage growth rate. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cost-of-living.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cost of living</a> indexes can also provide valuable information on real wage vs. nominal wage rate expectations. These indexes are used to make <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cola.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cost-of-living adjustments</a> (COLA) for workers, insurance plans, retirement plans, and more.\n", "\nOverall, inflation\u2019s effect on wages will affect the purchasing power of an individual consumer. When prices are rising in the marketplace but consumers are getting paid the same wage then a discrepancy is created, which leads to an effect on purchasing power. This is why real income decreases when inflation increases and vice versa.\n", "\nWhen inflation occurs, a consumer must pay more for a fixed quantity of goods or services. Theoretically, this is why savvy investors seek to hold a significant portion of their income in investments with a 2%+ return. In that case, with inflation at 2% they would be able to maintain their purchasing power at a constant level.\n", "\nFor instance, assume a consumer spends approximately $100 per month for a total of $1,200 per year on food during a year when inflation is rising at an annual rate of 1%. Also, assume that the consumer saw no change in their wages.\n", "\nA consumer with a $60,000 annual nominal salary would have lost approximately $595 of purchasing power over a year, or one cent per dollar spent, due to the effects of inflation. In terms of their food purchases, this means the same quantity of food cost them $12 more during the current year compared to the past year. Alternatively, if this consumer isn\u2019t following a strict food budget, they will likely spend approximately $101 per month or $1,212 to get the same amount of food they would have bought in the previous year.\n"]}
