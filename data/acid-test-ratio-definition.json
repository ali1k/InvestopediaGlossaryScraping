If the acid-test ratio is much lower than the current ratio, it means that a company's current assets are highly dependent on inventory.\n", "\nThis is not a bad sign in all cases, however, as some business models are inherently dependent on inventory.\u00a0Retail stores, for example, may have very low acid-test ratios without necessarily being in danger.\n", "\nFor the three months ending Oct. 31, 2019, Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s acid-test ratio was 0.18, while Target Corp.'s was 0.18.\u00a0In such cases, other metrics should be considered, such as inventory turnover. The acceptable range for an acid-test ratio will vary among different industries, and you'll find that comparisons are most meaningful when analyzing peer companies in the same industry as each other.\n", "\nFor most industries, the acid-test ratio should exceed 1. On the other hand, a very high ratio is not always good. It could indicate that cash has accumulated and is idle, rather than being reinvested, returned to shareholders or otherwise put to productive use.\n", "\nSome tech companies generate massive cash flows and accordingly have acid-test ratios as high as 7 or 8. While this is certainly better than the alternative, these companies have drawn criticism from <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/activist-investor.asp\">activist investors</a> who would prefer that shareholders receive a portion of the profits.\n", "\nThe numerator of the acid-test ratio can be defined in various ways, but the main consideration should be gaining a realistic view of the company's liquid assets.

Most importantly, inventory should be subtracted, keeping in mind that this will negatively skew the picture for retail businesses because of the amount of inventory they carry. Other elements that appear as assets on a balance sheet should be subtracted if they cannot be used to cover liabilities in the short term, such as advances to suppliers, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/prepaidexpense.asp\">prepayments</a>, and deferred tax assets.\n", "\nThe ratio's denominator should include all current liabilities, which are debts and obligations that are due within one year. It is important to note that time is not factored into the acid-test ratio. If a company's accounts payable are nearly due but its receivables won't come in for months, that company could be on much shakier ground than its ratio would indicate. The opposite can also be true.\n", "\nA company's acid-test ratio can be calculated using its balance sheet.

Then\u00a0divide current liquid current assets\u00a0by total current liabilities to calculate the acid-test ratio.

However, the acid-test ratio is considered more conservative than the current ratio because its calculation ignores items, such as inventory, which may be difficult to quickly liquidate. Another key difference is that the acid-test ratio includes\u00a0only assets\u00a0that can be converted to cash within\u00a090 days or less, while the current ratio includes those that can be converted to cash within one year.\n", "\nThe acid-test, or quick ratio, shows if a company has, or can get, enough cash to pay its immediate liabilities, such as short-term debt. For most industries, the acid-test ratio should exceed 1. If it's less than 1 then companies do not have enough liquid assets to pay their current liabilities and should be treated with caution. If the acid-test ratio is much lower than the current ratio, it means that a company's current assets are highly dependent on inventory. On the other hand, a very high ratio could indicate that accumulated cash is sitting idle, rather than being reinvested, returned to shareholders or otherwise put to productive use.\n", "\nA company's acid-test ratio can be calculated using its balance sheet.
