Financial institutions encompass a broad range of business operations within the financial services sector including banks, trust companies, insurance companies, brokerage firms, and investment dealers. Virtually everyone living in a developed economy has an ongoing or at least periodic need for the services of financial institutions.\n", "\nFinancial institutions serve most people in some way,\u00a0as financial operations are a critical part of any economy, with individuals and companies relying on\u00a0financial institutions for transactions and\u00a0investing.\u00a0Governments consider it imperative to oversee and regulate banks\u00a0and financial institutions because they do play such an integral part of the economy. Historically, bankruptcies of financial institutions can\u00a0create\u00a0panic.\n", "\nIn the United States, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insures regular deposit accounts to reassure individuals and businesses regarding the safety of their finances\u00a0with financial institutions.

Banks also act as payment agents via\u00a0credit cards, wire transfers, and currency exchange.\n", "\nInvestment banks specialize in providing services designed to facilitate business operations, such as capital expenditure financing and equity offerings, including initial public offerings (IPOs). They also commonly offer brokerage services for investors, act as market makers for trading exchanges, and manage mergers, acquisitions, and other corporate restructurings.\n", "\nAmong the most familiar <a class=\"CMY_Link CMY_Valid\" data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nbfcs.asp\">non-bank financial institutions</a> are insurance companies. Providing insurance, whether for individuals or corporations, is one of the oldest financial services. Protection of assets and protection against financial risk, secured through insurance products, is an essential service that facilitates individual and corporate investments that fuel economic growth.\n", "\nInvestment companies and brokerages, such as mutual fund and exchange-traded fund (ETF) provider Fidelity Investments, specialize in providing investment services that include wealth management and financial advisory services. They also provide access to investment products that may range from stocks and bonds all the way to lesser-known alternative investments, such as hedge funds and private equity investments.\n"]}
