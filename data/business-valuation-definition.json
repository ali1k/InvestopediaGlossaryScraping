Business valuation can be used to determine the fair value of a business for a variety of reasons, including sale value, establishing partner ownership, taxation,\u00a0and even divorce proceedings. Owners will often turn to professional business evaluators for an objective estimate of the value of the business.\n", "\nThe topic of business valuation is frequently discussed in corporate finance. Business valuation is typically conducted when a company is looking to sell all or a portion of its operations or looking to merge with or acquire another company. The valuation of a business is the process of determining the current worth of a business, using objective measures,\u00a0and evaluating all aspects of the business.\n", "\nA business valuation might include an analysis of the company's management, its <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalstructure.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">capital structure</a>, its future earnings prospects\u00a0or the market value of its assets. The tools used for valuation can vary among evaluators, businesses, and industries. Common approaches to business valuation include a review of financial statements, discounting cash flow models\u00a0and similar company comparisons.\n", "\nValuation is also important for tax reporting. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requires that a business is valued based on its fair market value. Some tax-related events such as sale, purchase\u00a0or gifting of shares of a company will be taxed depending on valuation.\n", "\nThere are numerous ways a company can be valued. You'll learn about several of these methods below.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Market capitalization</a> is the simplest method of business valuation. It is calculated by multiplying the company\u2019s share price by its total number of shares outstanding. For example, as of January 3, 2018, Microsoft Inc. traded at $86.35.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff With a total number of shares outstanding of 7.715 billion, the company could then be valued at $86.35 x 7.715 billion = $666.19 billion.\n", "\nUnder the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/times-revenue-method.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">times revenue</a> business valuation method, a stream of revenues generated over a certain period of time is applied to a multiplier which depends on the industry and economic environment. For example, a tech company may be valued at 3x revenue, while a service firm may be valued at 0.5x revenue.\n", "\nInstead of the times revenue method, the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earningsmultiplier.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">earnings multiplier</a> may be used to get a more accurate picture of the real value of a company, since a company\u2019s profits are a more reliable indicator of its financial success than sales revenue is. The earnings multiplier adjusts future profits against cash flow that could be invested at the current interest rate over the same period of time. In other words, it adjusts the current <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-earningsratio.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">P/E ratio</a> to account for current interest rates.\n", "\nThe <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DCF method</a> of business valuation is similar to the earnings multiplier. This method is based on projections of future cash flows, which are adjusted to get the current market value of the company. The main difference between the discounted cash flow method and the profit multiplier method is that it takes inflation into consideration to calculate the present value.\n", "\nThis is the value of shareholders\u2019 equity of a business as shown on the balance sheet statement. The <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bookvalue.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">book value</a> is derived by subtracting the total liabilities of a company from its total assets.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidation-value.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Liquidation</a> value is the net cash that a business will receive if its assets were liquidated and liabilities were paid off today.\n", "\nThis\u00a0is by no means an exhaustive list of the business valuation methods in use today. Other methods include replacement value, breakup value, asset-based valuation\u00a0and still many more.\n", "\nIn the U.S., <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accredited-in-business-valuation-abv.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Accredited in Business Valuation</a> (ABV) is a professional designation awarded to accountants such as\u00a0CPAs who specialize in calculating the value of businesses. The ABV certification is overseen by the\u00a0American Institute of Certified Public Accountants\u00a0(AICPA) and requires candidates to complete an application process, pass an exam, meet minimum Business Experience and Education requirements,<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff and pay a credential fee (as of 2018, the annual fee for\u00a0the ABV Credential was $380).\n", "\nMaintaining the ABV credential also requires those who hold the certification to meet minimum standards for work experience and lifelong learning. Successful applicants earn the right to use the ABV designation with their names, which can improve job opportunities, professional reputation and pay.
