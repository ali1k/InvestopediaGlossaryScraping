The goal is to identify and score relative performance based on goal attainment for specified outcomes. This type of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/budget.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">budget</a> is commonly used by government bodies and agencies to show the link between taxpayer\u00a0funds and the outcome of\u00a0services provided by federal, state, or local governments.\n", "\nThe decision process for performance budgets\u00a0focuses on outputs\u2014or outcomes\u2014of services. In other words, the allocation of funds and resources is based on specific goals agreed upon by budget committees and agency heads of services.\u00a0For instance, in schools, teachers may earn bonuses or promotions based on aggregate test scores among their students, which is supposed to show a high degree of skill and effectiveness (although this may not always be the case.)\n", "\nA few examples of outcomes that a performance budget could address include:\n", "\nAll of these would have numerical targets attached to them.\u00a0A performance budget would be developed accordingly to identify those target numbers and a method of evaluating performance. Performance budgets often rely on quantifying otherwise qualitative or subjective factors so that they can be measured and accounted for.\n", "\nThe advantages in the public sector are an increase in accountability of the local authorities to the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxpayer.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">taxpayers</a>, communication to the public about priorities, and quantifying particular goals. Taxpayers want to know where and how\u00a0their money is being spent and to what end.\n", "\nSimilarly, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/non-profitorganization.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">nonprofit organizations</a>\u00a0draw up performance budgets to link <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/input-output-analysis.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">inputs and outputs</a> for their missions. Donors to these organizations also want to know what kind of \"return\" society is getting from their donations.\n", "\nSome disadvantages of a performance budget include:\n", "\nOne prominent disadvantage of performance budgets is that by assigning target scores or numbers that an organization uses as its <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/benchmark.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">benchmark</a> for achievement, the numbers can be gamed or become the sole focus of one's task. For instance, teachers looking to earn a certain score may only focus on the factors that comprise that score and overlook or ignore other factors that may be important to teaching but not for the performance budget.\n"]}
