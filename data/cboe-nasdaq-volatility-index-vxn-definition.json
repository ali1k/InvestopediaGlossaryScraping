The Chicago Board Options Exchange (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cboe.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CBOE</a>) launched the VXN on January 23, 2001.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nThe VXN index is a widely watched gauge of market sentiment and volatility for the Nasdaq-100, which includes the top 100 U.S. and international non-financial securities by market capitalization listed on the Nasdaq. The VXN is quoted in percentage terms, just like its better-known counterpart the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vix.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CBOE Volatility Index (VIX)</a>, which measures 30-day implied volatility for the S&amp;P 500 index.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff\n", "\nThe CBOE Nasdaq Volatility Index was introduced in 2001 as the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/internet-bubble.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">dot-com bubble</a> in technology stocks was deflating. CBOE developed the VXN because of the massive divergence between the volatility seen in the Nasdaq market compared to the broader U.S. equity market from early 1999 onward.\n", "\nIndeed, the Nasdaq soared 137% in a 15-month period from January 1999 to its peak level of 5,132 in March 2000, before plunging 52% to just below 2,500 by December 2000.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff The <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sp500.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">S&amp;P 500</a>, by comparison, only gained 26% from January 1999 to its March 2000 peak, and then declined 15% by the end of 2000.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff\n", "\nThe higher the VXN level, the greater the expectation for Nasdaq-100 volatility. Like the VIX, the VXN functions best as a \u201cfear gauge\u201d or indicator of market nervousness about the technology sector.\n", "\nSince its introduction, the highest level reached by the VXN was 91.79 in September 2001, brought on by the 9/11 attack. Other notable peaks include 86.52 in October 2008, at the height of the global financial crisis, and 84.67 in March 2020, as the world reeled under the COVID-19 onslaught. The lowest level was 9.75 in March 2017. The average level for the VXN over this period was 21.14.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"6\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff By way of comparison, the average level for the VIX over this time frame was 19.89.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"5\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff These two volatility measures usually correlate closely with the VXN generally showing slightly higher volatility. The COVID-19 induced VXN spike proved to be short-lived as the gauge returned to levels in the 30s.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"6\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff\n", "\nThe methodology used by the CBOE to calculate the VXN\u2014whose value it disseminates continuously during trading hours\u2014is identical to that used for the VIX. VXN components are near-term (with at least one week to expiration) put and call options, and next-term options in the first and second Nasdaq-100 contract months (options with more than 23 days and less than 37 days to expiration). The selected options are out-of-the-money Nasdaq-100 puts and calls centered on an at-the-money strike price.\n", "\nMovement in the VXN represents the level of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/iv.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">implied volatility</a> from the prices of listed options on the Nasdaq 100 index. Increases in the VXN and positive movement represents higher variances in the underlying securities\u2019 price from their average. This usually occurs with uncertainty. Decreases in the VXN and negative movement represents lower volatility and a greater propensity for prices to trade in a tighter range. The VXN is generally followed along with the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nasdaq100.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nasdaq 100</a> to understand volatility in relation to positive or negative movements in the prices of the index.\n"]}
