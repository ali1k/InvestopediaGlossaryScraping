Due to the lack of insurance, these CDs yield a higher interest rate, as the purchaser assumes all of the risk. In the event that the financial institution or entity that issued the CD goes bankrupt, the purchaser loses the investment.\n", "\nMost certificates of deposit are insured by either the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fdic.asp\">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</a> (FDIC) or, in the case of credit unions, by the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/ncua.asp\">National Credit Union Association</a> (NCUA). These institutions would pay CD holders up to a certain limit\u00a0in the event that the lending financial institution was insolvent.\n", "\nAn FDIC Insured Account is a bank or\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/thriftbank.asp\">thrift</a>\u00a0(savings and loan association) account that meets the requirements to be covered by the\u00a0FDIC.\u00a0The type of accounts that can be FDIC-insured include\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nowaccount.asp\">negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW)</a>, checking, savings,\u00a0and money market deposit accounts, as well as\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/certificateofdeposit.asp\">Certificate of Deposits (CD)</a>.\n", "\nThe maximum amount that is insured in a qualified account is $250,000 per depositor, per member institution. That means if you have up to that amount in a bank account and the bank fails, then the FDIC makes you whole from any losses you suffered.\n", "\nAnother categories of CDs are exotics that are put together by investment companies. Investors in search of yield sometimes buy these without realizing that they are not government-guaranteed. They may have high teaser rates, long lock-up periods, variable rates, rates of return tied to indexes like the stock or bond markets, or even variable rates tied to an asset that has no publicly revealed price.\n", "\nSome <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brokered-cd.asp\">brokered CDs</a>\u00a0may be partly uninsured.\u00a0Other forms of CDs are\u00a0the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/certificate-of-deposits-4689733\">bull CD</a>,\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearcd.asp\">bear CD</a>, and\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/y/yankeecd.asp\">Yankee CD</a>.\u00a0The\u00a0bull CD's\u00a0interest rate correlates directly with the value of its underlying market index. When someone invests in a bull CD, she or he is guaranteed a minimum rate of return as well as an additional specified percentage, based on the associated market index.\u00a0The interest rate a holder of a bull CD receives during the life of the CD increases as the value of the market index increases.\n", "\nOffshore CDs put your money in a foreign institution's bank certificate.\u00a0The lure is interest rates that are a multiple of what you can get on a similar investment in the United States. The danger is betting on the safety of a foreign bank, and if your money is kept in that country's currency rather than U.S. dollars, you are exposed to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currencyrisk.asp\">currency risk</a>.\n"]}
