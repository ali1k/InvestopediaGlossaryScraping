The higher the score, the better a borrower looks to potential lenders. A credit score is based on <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-history.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">credit history</a>: number of open accounts, total levels of debt, and repayment history, and other factors. Lenders use credit scores to evaluate the probability that an individual will repay loans in a timely manner.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff <span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nThe credit score model was created by the Fair Isaac Corporation, also known as\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fico-fair-isaac.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FICO</a>, and it is used by\u00a0financial institutions.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff While other\u00a0credit-scoring\u00a0systems exist, the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/ficoscore.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FICO score</a>\u00a0is by far the most commonly used.\u00a0There are a number of ways to improve an individual's score, including repaying loans on time and keeping debt low.\u00a0\n", "\nA credit score can significantly affect your financial life. It plays a key role in a lender's decision to offer you credit. People with credit scores below 640, for example, are generally considered to be\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/subprime-borrower.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">subprime borrowers</a>.

They may also require a shorter repayment term or a co-signer for borrowers with a low credit score.\n", "\nConversely, a credit score of 700 or above is generally considered good and may result in a borrower receiving a lower interest rate, which results in their paying less money in interest over the life of the loan.\u00a0Scores greater than 800 are considered excellent. While every creditor defines its own ranges for credit scores, the average FICO score range is often used:<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nA person\u2019s credit score may also determine the size of an initial deposit required to obtain a smartphone, cable service or utilities, or to rent an apartment. And lenders frequently review borrowers' scores, especially when deciding whether to change an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">interest rate</a> or credit limit on a credit card.\u00a0\n", "\nThere are three major credit reporting agencies in the United States (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/investing/experian-vs-equifax/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Experian, Equifax</a>, and Transunion), which report, update, and store consumers' credit histories. While there can be differences in the information collected by the three credit bureaus, there are five main factors evaluated when calculating a credit score:<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"5\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nPayment history counts for 35% of a credit score and shows whether a person pays their obligations on time. Total amount owed counts for 30% and takes into account the percentage of credit available to a person that is currently being used, which is known as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-utilization-rate.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">credit utilization</a>.\u00a0Length of credit history counts for 15%, with longer credit histories being considered less risky, as there is more data to determine payment history.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"5\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/07/loan_types.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The type of credit</a> used counts for 10% of a credit score and shows if a person has a mix of installment credit, such as car loans or mortgage loans, and revolving credit, such as credit cards. New credit also counts for 10%, and it factors in how many new accounts a person has, how many new accounts they have applied for recently, which result in\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-inquiry.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">credit inquiries</a>, and when the most recent account was opened.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"5\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nWhen information is updated on a borrower\u2019s credit report, their credit score changes and can rise or fall based on new information.

An excellent score can land you lower interest rates, meaning you will pay less for any line of credit you take out. But it's up to you, the borrower, to make sure your credit remains strong so you can have access to more opportunities to borrow if you need to.\n"]}
