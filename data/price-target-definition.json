Price targets can pertain to all types of securities, from complex <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investment-product.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">investment products</a> to stocks and bonds. When setting a stock's price target, an analyst is trying to determine what the stock is worth and where the price will be in 12 or 18 months. Ultimately, price targets depend on the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valuation.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">valuation</a> of the company that's issuing the stock.\n", "\nAnalysts generally publish their price targets in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/research-report.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">research reports</a> on specific companies, along with their <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0512/understanding-analyst-ratings.aspx\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">buy, sell, and hold recommendations</a> for the company's stock. Stock price targets are often quoted in the financial news media.\n", "\nA price target is a price at which an analyst believes a stock to be fairly valued relative to its projected and historical <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earnings.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">earnings</a>. When an analyst raises their price target for a stock, they generally expect the stock price to rise.\n", "\nConversely, lowering their price target may mean that the analyst expects the stock price to fall. Price targets are an organic factor in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-analysis.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">financial analysis</a>; they can change over time as new information becomes available.\n", "\nThe price target is based on assumptions about a security's future supply and demand, technical levels, and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundamentals.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fundamentals</a>. Different analysts and financial institutions use various valuation methods and take into account different economic conditions when deciding on a price target.\n", "\nFor <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundamentalanalysis.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fundamental analysts</a>, a common way to discern the price target for a stock is to create a multiple of the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-earningsratio.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio</a>\u2014by multiplying the market price by the company\u2019s trailing 12-month earnings.\u00a0<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nIn some cases, particularly with volatile stocks, analysts will look for additional guidance to form their price targets, which could include reviewing a company\u2019s balance sheet and other financial statements and comparing them to historical results, current economics, and the competitive environment, studying the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/02/062602.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">health of a company's management</a>, and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/ratioanalysis.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">analyzing other ratios</a>.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technicalanalysis.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Technical analysts</a> use indicators, price action, statistics, trends, and price momentum to gauge the future price of a security. One way that they arrive at a price target is to find areas of defined <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/trading/support-and-resistance-basics/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">support and resistance</a>. An analyst will do this by charting a price that moves between at least two similar highs and lows without breaking above or below those points at any point in between.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trader.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Traders</a> will generally look to exit their <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/position.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">position</a> on a stock when the originally expected value of the trade has been recognized. Although price targets can help traders understand when to buy or sell a stock, traders can and should determine their own price targets for entering and exiting positions.\n", "\nFor individual investors, the assumptions that underlie analysts\u2019 price targets are not always obvious. Investors should use analysts' price targets and recommendations as just one part of their investment <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duediligence.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">due diligence</a>, which could include reviewing a company's financials and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/072414/how-company-files-sec.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">regulatory filings</a>, among other resources.\n", "\nAccurately forecasting a security's price movement is based on projection, probability, numerous tools, and lots of experience.

Analyst's attempt to satisfy this basic need by projecting a security's future price using a blend of fundamental data points and educated assumptions about it's future valuation.\n", "\nIt is important to note that, despite the best efforts of analysts, a price target is a guess with the variance in analyst projections linked to their estimates of future performance. Studies have found that, historically, the overall accuracy rate is around 30% for price targets with 12 - 18 month horizons. However, they do have the ability to sway investor sentiment, especially if they are from credible analysts.\n", "\nAnalysts generally publish their price targets in research reports on specific companies, along with their buy, sell, and hold recommendations for the company's stock.
