Income, and sometimes principal, generated from the trust is given to the surviving spouse to ensure that the spouse is taken care of for the rest of their life.\n", "\nThis type of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irrevocabletrust.asp\">irrevocable trust </a>is commonly used by individuals who have children from another marriage. QTIPs enable the grantor to look after his current spouse and make sure that\u00a0the assets from the trust are then passed on to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beneficiary.asp\">beneficiaries</a> of his choice, such as the children from the grantor's first marriage.\n", "\nAside from providing the living spouse with a source of funds, a QTIP can also help limit applicable death and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gifttax.asp\">gift taxes</a>. Additionally, it can assert control over how the funds are handled should the surviving spouse die, as the spouse never assumes the power of appointment over the principal. This can prevent these assets from transferring to the living spouse\u2019s new spouse, should she remarry.\n", "\nThe property within the QTIP providing funds to a surviving spouse qualifies for <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unlimited-marital-deduction.asp\">marital deductions</a>, meaning the value of the trust is not taxable after the first spouse\u2019s death. Instead, the property becomes taxable after the second spouse's death, with\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liability.asp\">liability</a>\u00a0transferring to the named beneficiaries of the assets within the trust.\n", "\nA minimum of one <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trustee.asp\">trustee</a> must be appointed to manage the trust, though multiple individuals or organizations may be named simultaneously. The trustee\u00a0or trustees\u00a0will be responsible for controlling the trust and will also have authority over how its assets are managed. Examples of possible trustees include, but are not limited to, the surviving spouse, a financial institution, an attorney\u00a0and other family members or friends.\n", "\nThe surviving spouse named within a QTIP receives payments from the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trust.asp\">trust</a> based on the income the trust generates, similar to the issuance of stock dividends. As the surviving spouse is never the true owner of the property, a lien cannot be put against the property within the trust or the trust itself. Payments will be made to the spouse for the rest of their life. Upon death, the payments cease, as they are not transferable to another person. The <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp\">assets</a> in the trust then become the property of the listed beneficiaries.\n"]}
