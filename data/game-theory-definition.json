In some respects, game theory is the science of strategy, or at least the optimal decision-making of independent and competing actors in a strategic setting.\n", "\nThe key pioneers of game theory were mathematician John von Neumann and economist Oskar Morgenstern in the 1940s.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\"></span> Mathematician John Nash is regarded by many as providing the first significant extension of the von Neumann and Morgenstern work.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\"></span>\n", "\nThe focus of game theory is the game, which serves as a model of an interactive situation among rational players.\u00a0The key to game theory is that one player's payoff is contingent on the strategy implemented by the other player.\u00a0The game identifies the players' identities, preferences, and available strategies and how these strategies affect the outcome. Depending on the model, various other requirements or assumptions may be necessary.\n", "\nGame theory has a wide range of applications, including psychology, evolutionary biology, war, politics, economics, and business. Despite its many advances, game theory is still a young and developing science.\n", "\nAny time we have a situation with two or more players that involve known payouts or quantifiable consequences, we can use game theory to help determine the most likely outcomes. Let's start out by defining a few terms commonly used in the study of game theory:\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nash-equilibrium.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nash Equilibrium</a> is an outcome reached that, once achieved, means no player can increase payoff by changing decisions unilaterally. It can also be thought of as \"no regrets,\" in the sense that once a decision is made, the player will have no regrets concerning decisions considering the consequences.\n", "\nThe Nash Equilibrium is reached over time, in most cases. However, once the Nash Equilibrium is reached, it will not be deviated from. After we learn how to find the Nash Equilibrium, take a look at how a unilateral move would affect the situation. Does it make any sense? It shouldn't, and that's why the Nash Equilibrium is described as \"no regrets.\" Generally, there can be more than one equilibrium in a game.\n", "\nHowever, this usually occurs in games with more complex elements than two choices by two players. In simultaneous games that are repeated over time, one of these multiple equilibria is reached after some trial and error. This scenario of different choices overtime before reaching equilibrium is the most often played out in the business world when two firms are determining prices for highly interchangeable products, such as airfare or soft drinks.\n", "\nGame theory brought about a revolution in economics by addressing crucial problems in prior mathematical economic models. For instance, neoclassical economics struggled to understand entrepreneurial anticipation and could not handle the imperfect competition. Game theory turned attention away from steady-state equilibrium toward the market process.\n", "\nIn business, game theory is beneficial for modeling competing behaviors between economic agents.\u00a0Businesses often have several strategic choices that affect their ability to realize economic gain.\u00a0For example, businesses may face dilemmas such as whether to retire existing products or develop new ones, lower prices relative to the competition, or employ new marketing strategies.\u00a0Economists often use game theory to understand <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/oligopoly.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">oligopoly</a> firm behavior.\u00a0It helps to predict likely outcomes when firms engage in certain behaviors, such as price-fixing and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/collusion.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">collusion</a>.\n", "\nAlthough there are many types (e.g., symmetric/asymmetric, simultaneous/sequential, et al.) of game theories, cooperative and non-cooperative game theories are the most common.\u00a0Cooperative game theory deals with how coalitions, or cooperative groups, interact when only the payoffs are known.\u00a0It is a game between coalitions of players rather than between individuals, and it questions how groups form and how they allocate the payoff among players.\n", "\nNon-cooperative game theory deals with how rational economic agents deal with each other to achieve their own goals.\u00a0The most common non-cooperative game is the strategic game, in which only the available strategies and the outcomes that result from a combination of choices are listed.\u00a0A simplistic example of a real-world non-cooperative game is Rock-Paper-Scissors.\u00a0\n", "\nThere are several \"games\" that game theory analyzes. Below, we will just briefly describe a few of these.\n", "\nThe <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/prisoners-dilemma.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Prisoner's Dilemma</a> is the most well-known example of game theory.\u00a0Consider the example of two criminals arrested for a crime. Prosecutors have no hard evidence to convict them. However, to gain a confession, officials remove the prisoners from their solitary cells and question each one in separate chambers.\u00a0Neither prisoner has the means to communicate with each other.\u00a0Officials present four deals, often displayed as a 2 x 2 box.\n", "\nThe most favorable strategy is to not confess.\u00a0However, neither is aware of the other's strategy, and without certainty that one will not confess, both will likely confess and receive a five-year prison sentence.\u00a0The Nash equilibrium suggests that in a prisoner's dilemma, both players will make the move that is best for them individually but worse for them collectively.\n", "\nThe expression \"<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tit-for-tat.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tit for tat</a>\" has been determined to be the optimal strategy for optimizing a prisoner's dilemma. Tit for tat was introduced by Anatol Rapoport, who developed a strategy in which each participant in an iterated prisoner's dilemma follows a course of action consistent with his opponent's previous turn. For example, if provoked, a player subsequently responds with retaliation; if unprovoked, the player cooperates.\n", "\nThis is a simple game in which Player A must decide how to split a cash prize with Player B, who has no input into Player A\u2019s decision. While this is not a game theory strategy\u00a0<em>per se</em>, it does provide some interesting insights into people\u2019s behavior. Experiments reveal about 50% keep all the money to themselves,\u00a05% split it equally,\u00a0and the other 45% give the other participant a smaller share.\n", "\nThe dictator game is closely related to the ultimatum game, in which Player A is given a set amount of money, part of which has to be given to Player B, who can accept or reject the amount given. The catch is\u00a0if the second player rejects the amount offered, both A and B get nothing. The dictator and ultimatum games hold important lessons for issues such as charitable giving and\u00a0philanthropy.\n", "\nIn a volunteer\u2019s dilemma, someone has to undertake a chore or job for the common good. The worst possible outcome is realized if nobody volunteers. For example, consider a company in which\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-theory/11/detecting-financial-fraud.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">accounting fraud is rampant</a>, though top management is unaware of it. Some junior employees in the accounting department are aware of the fraud but hesitate to tell top management\u00a0because it would result in the employees involved in the fraud being fired and most likely prosecuted.\n", "\nBeing labeled as a\u00a0whistleblower\u00a0may also have some repercussions down the line. But if nobody volunteers, the large-scale fraud may result in the company\u2019s eventual\u00a0bankruptcy\u00a0and the loss of everyone\u2019s jobs.\n", "\nThe <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/centipede-game.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">centipede game</a> is an extensive-form game in\u00a0game theory\u00a0in which two players alternately get a chance to take the larger share of a slowly increasing money stash. It is arranged so that if a player passes the stash to his opponent who then takes the stash, the player receives a smaller amount than if he had taken the pot.\n", "\nThe centipede game concludes as soon as a player takes the stash, with that player getting the larger portion and the other player getting the smaller portion. The game has a pre-defined total number of rounds, which are known to each player in advance.\n", "\nThe biggest issue with game theory is that, like most other economic models, it relies on the assumption that people are rational actors that are self-interested and utility-maximizing. Of course, we are social beings who do cooperate and do care about the welfare of others, often at our own expense. Game theory cannot account for the fact that in some situations we may fall into a Nash equilibrium, and other times not, depending on the social context and who the players are.\n", "\nIt is called game theory since the theory tries to understand the strategic actions of two or more \"players\" in a given situation containing set rules and outcomes. While used in a number of disciplines, game theory is most notably used as a tool within the study of business and economics. The \"games\" may thus involve how two competitor firms will react to price cuts by the other, if a firm should acquire another, or how traders in a stock market may react to price changes.\n", "\nIn theoretic terms, these <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/111113/advanced-game-theory-strategies-decisionmaking.asp\">games may be categorized</a> as similar to prisoner's dilemmas, the dictator game, the hawk-and-dove, and battle of the sexes, among several other variations.\n", "\nLike many economic models, game theory also contains a set of strict assumptions that must hold for the theory to make good predictions in practice. First, all players are utility-maximizing rational actors that have full information about the game, the rules, and the consequences. Players are not allowed to communicate or interact with one another. Possible outcomes are not only known in advance but also cannot be changed. The number of players in a game can theoretically be infinite, but most games will be put into the context of only two players.\n", "\nThe\u00a0Nash equilibrium\u00a0is an important concept referring to a stable state in a game where no player can gain an advantage by unilaterally changing a strategy, assuming the other participants also do not change their strategies. The Nash equilibrium provides the solution concept in a non-cooperative (adversarial) game. It is named after John Nash who received the Nobel in 1994 for his work\n", "\nGame theory is largely attributed to the work of mathematician John von Neumann and economist Oskar Morgenstern in the 1940s, and was developed extensively by many other researchers and scholars in the 1950s. It remains an area of active research and applied science to this day.\n"]}
