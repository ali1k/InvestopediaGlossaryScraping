This measure aggregates the credit ratings of the portfolio's holdings into a single rating. WARFs are most often calculated for <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cdo.asp\">collateralized debt obligations</a> (CDOs).\n", "\nTo calculate the weighted average rating factor on a CDO, the rating agencies must first determine a\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditrating.asp\">credit rating</a>\u00a0for each instrument\u00a0underlying the CDO. In the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fitch-ratings.asp\">Fitch Ratings</a> taxonomy, for example, this rating can range\u00a0from extremely high credit quality (AAA)\u00a0to\u00a0low quality (CCC) to default (D). This letter rating\u00a0corresponds to a numerical rating factor, which in turn correspond to the 10-year probability of default. The WARF\u00a0is determined by calculating the\u00a0weighted average\u00a0of these numerical factors. To calculate the weighted average,\u00a0the notional balance of the asset is multiplied by the rating factor and then these values are summed. This sum is then divided by the total notional balance of the portfolio.\n"]}
