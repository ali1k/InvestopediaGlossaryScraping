Mortgage insurance can refer to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/insurance/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">private mortgage insurance</a> (PMI), qualified mortgage insurance premium (MIP) insurance, or mortgage title insurance. What these have in common is an obligation to make the lender or property holder whole in the event of specific cases of loss.\n", "\nMortgage life insurance, on the other hand, which sounds similar, is designed to protect heirs if the borrower dies while owing mortgage payments. It may pay off either the lender or the heirs, depending on the terms of the policy.\n", "\nMortgage insurance may come with a typical pay-as-you-go\u00a0premium payment, or it may be capitalized into a lump-sum payment at the time of\u00a0mortgage origination. For homeowners who are required to have PMI because of the 80% <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/loantovalue.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">loan-to-value ratio rule</a>, they can request that the insurance policy be canceled once 20% of the principal balance has been paid off. Here are three types of mortgage insurance:\n", "\nPrivate mortgage insurance (PMI)\u00a0is a type of\u00a0mortgage insurance\u00a0a borrower might be required to buy\u00a0as a condition of a\u00a0conventional mortgage loan. Like other kinds of mortgage insurance, PMI protects the lender, not the borrower.\u00a0The lender arranges PMI and it's provided by private insurance companies.\n", "\nPMI is usually required if a borrower gets\u00a0a\u00a0conventional loan with a\u00a0down payment of less than 20%.\u00a0A lender might also require\u00a0PMI\u00a0if a borrower is\u00a0refinancing with a conventional loan, and equity\u00a0is less than 20% of home value.\n", "\nWhen you get a U.S. Federal Housing Administration (FHA)-backed mortgage, you will be required to pay a\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/insurance/qualified-insurance-premium/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">qualified mortgage insurance premium</a>,\u00a0which provides a similar type of insurance. MIPs have different rules, including that everyone who has an FHA mortgage must buy this type of insurance, regardless of the size of their down payment.\n", "\nMortgage <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/title_insurance.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">title insurance</a> protects against\u00a0loss in the event a\u00a0sale is later invalidated because of a problem with the\u00a0title.\u00a0Mortgage title insurance protects a\u00a0beneficiary against losses if it is\u00a0determined at the time of the sale that someone other than the seller owns the property.\u00a0\n", "\nBefore mortgage closing, a representative, such as a lawyer or a title company employee, performs a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/titlesearch.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">title search</a>. The process is designed to uncover any liens placed on the property that would prevent the owner from selling. A title search also verifies\u00a0that the\u00a0real estate being sold belongs to the seller. Despite a thorough search, it isn\u2019t hard to miss important pieces of\u00a0evidence when information is not centralized.\n", "\nBorrowers are often\u00a0offered mortgage protection life insurance when they fill\u00a0out\u00a0paperwork to start a\u00a0mortgage. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/insurance/why-you-dont-need-mpli/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A borrower\u00a0can decline this insurance</a> when it is offered, but you may be required to sign a series of\u00a0forms and waivers, verifying your decision. This extra paperwork intends to\u00a0prove\u00a0you understand the risks associated with having a mortgage.\n", "\nPayouts for mortgage life insurance can be either declining-term (the payout drops as the mortgage balance drops) or level, although the latter costs more. The recipient of the payments can be either the lender or the heirs of the borrower, depending on the terms of the policy.\n"]}
