Dumping is a process wherein a company exports a product at a price that is significantly lower than the price it normally charges in its home (or its domestic) market.\n", "\nIn order to protect their respective economy, many countries impose duties on products they believe are being dumped in their national market because these products have the potential to undercut local businesses and the local economy.\n", "\nIn the U.S., the International Trade Commission (ITC)\u2013an independent government agency\u2013is tasked with imposing anti-dumping duties. Their actions are based on recommendations they receive from the U.S. Department of Commerce and investigations by the ITC and/or the Department of Commerce.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\u00a0\n", "\nIn many cases, the duties imposed on these goods exceeds the value of the goods. Anti-dumping duties are typically levied when a foreign company is selling an item significantly below the price at which it is being produced.\n", "\nWhile the intention of anti-dumping duties is to save domestic jobs, these tariffs can also lead to higher prices for domestic consumers. And, in the long-term, anti-dumping duties can reduce the international competition of domestic companies producing similar goods.\n", "\nThe World Trade Organization (WTO) is an international\u00a0organization\u00a0that deals with the rules of\u00a0trade\u00a0between nations.\u00a0The WTO also operates a set of international trade rules, including the international regulation of anti-dumping measures. The WTO does not intervene in the activities of companies engaged in dumping. Instead, it focuses on how governments can\u2014or cannot\u2014react to the practice of dumping.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff In general, the WTO agreement permits governments to act against dumping \"if it causes or threatens material injury to an established industry in the territory of a contracting party or materially retards the establishment of a domestic industry.\"<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nThis intervention must be justified in order to uphold the WTO's commitment to free-market principles.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff Anti-dumping duties have the potential to distort the market.
