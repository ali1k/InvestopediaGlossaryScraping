This excess <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/return.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">return</a> compensates investors for taking on the relatively higher risk of equity investing. The size of the premium varies and depends on the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risk-profile.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">level of risk</a> in a particular portfolio.

Investing in the stock market comes with certain risks, but it also has the potential for big rewards. So, as a rule, investors are compensated with higher <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/premium.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">premiums</a> when they invest in the stock market. Whatever return you earn above a risk-free investment such as U.S. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurybill.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Treasury bill</a> (T-bill) or a bond is called an equity risk premium.\n", "\nAn equity risk premium is based on the idea of the risk-reward tradeoff. It is a forward-looking figure and, as such, the premium is theoretical. But there's no real way to tell just how much an investor will make since no one can actually say how well <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equity.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">equities</a> or the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equitymarket.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">equity market</a> will perform in the future. Instead, an equity risk premium is an estimation as a backward-looking metric. It observes the stock market and government <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bond</a> performance over a defined period of time and uses that historical performance to the potential for future returns. The estimates vary wildly depending on the time frame and method of calculation.\n", "\nTo calculate the equity risk premium, we can begin with the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capm.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">capital asset pricing model</a> (CAPM), which is usually written as <strong>R<sub>a</sub>\u00a0= R<sub>f</sub>\u00a0+ \u03b2<sub>a</sub>\u00a0(R<sub>m</sub>\u00a0- R<sub>f</sub>), </strong>where:\n", "\nSo, the equation for equity <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risk.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">risk</a> premium is a simple reworking of the CAPM which can be written as: <strong>Equity Risk Premium = R<sub>a</sub>\u00a0- R<sub>f</sub>\u00a0= \u03b2<sub>a</sub>\u00a0(R<sub>m</sub>\u00a0- R<sub>f</sub>)</strong>\n", "\nIf we are simply talking about the stock market (a = m), then\u00a0R<sub>a</sub>\u00a0=\u00a0R<sub>m</sub>. The beta coefficient is a measure of a stock's volatility\u2014or risk\u2014versus that of the market. The market's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volatility.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">volatility</a> is conventionally set to 1, so if a = m, then\u00a0\u03b2<sub>a</sub>\u00a0=\u00a0\u03b2<sub>m</sub>\u00a0= 1.\u00a0R<sub>m</sub>\u00a0-\u00a0R<sub>f</sub>\u00a0is known as the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketriskpremium.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">market premium</a>, and\u00a0R<sub>a</sub>\u00a0-\u00a0R<sub>f</sub>\u00a0is the risk premium. If <em>a</em> is an equity investment, then\u00a0R<sub>a</sub>\u00a0-\u00a0R<sub>f</sub>\u00a0is the equity risk premium. If\u00a0a = m, then the market premium and the equity risk premium are the same.\n", "\nAccording to some <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economist.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">economists</a>, this isn't a generalizable concept even though certain markets in certain time periods may display a considerable equity risk premium. They argue that too much focus on specific cases has made a statistical peculiarity seem like an economic law. Several stock exchanges have gone bust over the years, so a focus on the historically exceptional U.S. market may distort the picture. This focus is known as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/survivorshipbias.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">survivorship bias</a>.\n", "\nThe majority of economists\u00a0agree, though that the concept of an\u00a0equity risk premium is valid. Over the long term, markets\u00a0compensate <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investor.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">investors</a> more for taking on the greater risk of investing in stocks. How exactly to calculate this premium is disputed. A survey of academic economists gives an average range of 3% to 3.5% for a one-year horizon, and 5% to 5.5% for a 30-year horizon. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cfo.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chief financial officers</a> (CFOs) estimate the premium to be 5.6% over T-bills. The second half of the 20th century saw a relatively high equity risk premium, over 8% by some calculations, versus just under 5% for the first half of the century. Given that the century ended at the height of the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dotcom-bubble.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">dotcom bubble</a>, however, this arbitrary window may not be ideal.\n", "\nThe equation noted above summarizes the theory behind the equity risk premium, but it doesn't account for all possible scenarios. The calculation is fairly straightforward if you plug in historical rates of return and use them to estimate future rates. But how do you estimate the expected rate of return if you want to make a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forward-looking.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">forward-looking</a> statement?\n", "\nOne method is to use dividends to estimate long-term growth, using a reworking of the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gordongrowthmodel.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gordon Growth Model</a>: <strong>k = D / P + g</strong>\n", "\nwhere:\n", "\nAnother is to use growth in earnings, rather than growth in dividends. In this model, the expected return is equal to the earnings yield, the reciprocal of the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-earningsratio.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">price-to-earnings ratio</a> (P/E ratio): <strong>k = E / P</strong>\n", "\nwhere:\n", "\nThe drawback of both of these models is that they do not account for <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valuation.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">valuation</a>. That is, they assume the stocks' prices\u00a0never correct.
