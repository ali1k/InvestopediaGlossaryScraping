It is rooted in the economic theories of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/john_maynard_keynes.asp\">John Maynard Keynes</a>.\n", "\nThe <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/multiplier.asp\">multiplier</a> attempted to quantify the additional effects of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/101315/do-lower-interest-rates-increase-investment-spending.asp\">investment spending</a> beyond those immediately measurable. The larger an investment\u2019s multiplier, the more efficient it is in creating and distributing wealth throughout the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economy.asp\">economy</a>.\n", "\nThe investment multiplier tries to determine the economic impact of public or private investment. For instance, extra government spending on roads can increase the income of construction works, as well as the income of materials suppliers. These people may spend the extra income in the retail, consumer goods, or service industries, boosting the income of the workers in those sectors.\n", "\nAs you can see, this cycle can repeat itself through several iterations; what began as an investment in roads quickly multiplied into an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economic-stimulus.asp\">economic stimulus</a> benefiting workers across a wide range of industries.\n", "\nMathematically, the investment multiplier is a function of two main factors: the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marginalpropensitytoconsume.asp\">marginal propensity to consume</a> (MPC) and the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marginal-propensity-save.asp\">marginal propensity to save</a> (MPS).\n", "\nConsider the road construction workers in our previous example. If the average worker has an MPC of 70%, that means they consume $0.70 out of every dollar they earn, on average. In practice, they might spend that $0.70 on items such as rent, gasoline, groceries, and entertainment. If that same worker has an MPS of 30%, that means they would save $0.30 out of every dollar earned, on average.\n", "\nThese concepts also apply to businesses. Like individuals, businesses must \u201cconsume\u201d a significant portion of their income by paying for expenditures such as employees\u2019 wages, facilities\u2019 rents, and the leases and repairs of equipment. A typical company might consume 90% of their income on such payments, meaning that its MPS\u2014the profits earned by its shareholders\u2014would be only 10%.\n", "\nThe formula for calculating the investment multiplier of a project is simply:\n", "\n<span data-value=\"1 / (1 - MPC)\">\ufeff<span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\">\n<math>\n<semantics>\n<mrow>\n<mn>\n1\n</mn>\n<mi>\n/\n</mi>\n<mo>\n(\n</mo>\n<mn>\n1\n</mn>\n<mo>\n\u2212\n</mo>\n<mi>\nM\n</mi>\n<mi>\nP\n</mi>\n<mi>\nC\n</mi>\n<mo>\n)\n</mo>\n</mrow>\n<annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\n1 / (1 - MPC)\n</annotation>\n</semantics>\n</math></span><span class=\"katex-html\"><span class=\"strut\"></span><span class=\"strut bottom\"></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"mord mathrm\">1</span><span class=\"mord mathrm\">/</span><span class=\"mopen\">(</span><span class=\"mord mathrm\">1</span><span class=\"mbin\">\u2212</span><span class=\"mord mathit\">M</span><span class=\"mord mathit\">P</span><span class=\"mord mathit\">C</span><span class=\"mclose\">)</span></span></span></span></span>\ufeff\n", "\nTherefore, in our above examples, the investment multipliers would be 3.33 and 10 for the workers and the businesses, respectively. The reason the businesses are associated with a higher investment multiple is that their MPC is higher than that of the workers. In other words, they spend a greater percentage of their income on other parts of the economy, thereby spreading the economic stimulus caused by the initial investment more widely.\n"]}
