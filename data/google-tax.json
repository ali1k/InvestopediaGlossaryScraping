For example, internet giant Alphabet Inc.'s (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=googl\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GOOGL</a>) Google paid a negligible amount as tax in the United Kingdom by completing its transactions in the low tax\u00a0capital city of Dublin, Ireland, even though the revenue of $6.5 billion was earned in the UK.\n", "\nThough the term includes the name of the\u00a0company (Google) that became the poster boy for the practice, diverting profits is observed to be rampant across various industry sectors. Mainly technology giants from the U.S., like Facebook Inc. (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=fb\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FB</a>), Apple Inc.

(<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=amzn\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AMZN</a>), and other <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/multinationalcorporation.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">multinational corporations (MNC)</a> like Starbucks Inc.

For instance, a mobile app like Facebook\u2019s WhatsApp messenger or a\u00a0game like Clash of Clans\u00a0may not employ a single employee in a particular country, but can still derive a lot of profit from its local user base who generate revenues for the company through online ads and in-app purchases. The companies enjoyed the freedom to account for such revenues and earnings at a destination of their choice, and they often diverted it to low cost jurisdictions.\n", "\nThe U.S.\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</a>\u00a0mandates that American businesses publicly report details on where and how much revenue\u00a0they generate across the globe, allowing the authorities of other countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia to obtain more concrete data on any possible tax avoidance measures used by American businesses.\n", "\nIn the U.K. and Australia, tax laws were modified to prevent companies from following such practices. Amid rising public anger, the U.K.\u00a0introduced the diverted profits tax in 2015 which was set at 25 per cent.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC), the U.K.\u2019s tax collection agency, secured \u00a36.5 billion (around $8.33 billion) in additional taxes by challenging the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/transfer-pricing.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">transfer pricing</a> arrangements of multinationals between 2012-2018.
