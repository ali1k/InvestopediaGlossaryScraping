Examples of user fees could include highway tolls or parking garages.\n", "\nPeople pay user fees for the use of many government-affiliated services and facilities\u00a0as well. At the\u00a0federal\u00a0level, for example, there is a fee to go up to the top of the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www.nps.gov/stli/index.htm\">Statue of Liberty</a>\u00a0and to drive into the country\u2019s many\u00a0national parks. Also, certain services offered by the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://www.loc.gov/\">Library of Congress</a> in Washington, D.C. require the public to pay a fee.\n", "\nIn levying or authorizing user fees from a government\u00a0standpoint, the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/congress.asp\">U.S. Congress</a> determines whether the revenue should go into the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/ustreasury.asp\">Treasury</a> or should be available to the agency providing the goods or services. Government services and facilities that are supported by user fees instead of by taxes may closely resemble\u00a0private businesses\u00a0because it is not apparent whether a true demand exists for those services and facilities.\n", "\nIn that sense, the line between user fees and taxes can blur in certain circumstances. Sometimes, a tax will be incorrectly labeled as a user fee for political reasons (i.e., user fees that are often deemed more palatable and able to be passed on to voters, than taxes). For example, if a politician wants to keep a promise to not raise taxes but still take certain steps to try to increase government revenue streams, the politician may push for an increase in certain kinds of taxes that can be labeled as fees.\n", "\nIn contrast to user fees,\u00a0taxes\u00a0must be paid and do not necessarily go toward a specific service or facility that an individual actually uses or benefits from. For example, the money governments spend to treat smoking-related illnesses, in this case via the sale of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tobacco-tax.asp\">cigarettes</a>, could be considered both a tax and a fee.\u00a0Income taxes can be an alternative to funding facilities and services with user fees. Everyone pays income taxes, including those who may not necessarily use or benefit from a specific facility or service.\n", "\nWithin international development circles, user fees refer to a system fee for fundamental health care, education and other essential services implemented by a\u00a0developing country\u00a0to make up for the costs of these services. For one, the\u00a0International Monetary Fund\u00a0often recommends that nations start charging fees for these services in order to reduce\u00a0budget\u00a0deficits.\n", "\nFor poorer nations, however, such user fees can have a counteractive effect, adding a burdensome expense on an already impoverished population.\n"]}
