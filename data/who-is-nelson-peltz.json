He went to school at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business but dropped out in 1963. For $100 a week, he started driving delivery trucks for his father\u2019s frozen food business where he grew the $2.5 million private business into a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/publiccompany.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">public company</a> with $140 million in revenue in little more than a decade.\n", "\nNelson Peltz took advantage of the acquisitional value of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/high_yield_bond.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">high yield (junk) bonds</a> sold by <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/michaelmilken.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Michael Milken</a> in the 1980s. By doing <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leveragedbuyout.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">leveraged buyouts</a> financed with these <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/junkbond.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">junk bonds</a>, he turned his modest income into a multi-million dollar fortune. In 1983, Nelson Peltz acquired an interest in Triangle Industries which was then valued at an estimated $80 million. By 1988, Triangle Industries was valued at approximately $4 billion and was sold to state-owned French <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"5\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/conglomerate.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">conglomerate</a> Pechiney SA. Triangle`s stock leaped from $10.37 a share to $46.25 after the sale deal was announced publicly.\n", "\nPeltz, through the use of junk bonds, bought out National Can Corporation in 1985 for $460 million and the packaging division of American Can Company in 1986 for $570 million. Both can companies were merged to form American National Can Corp which became the world\u2019s largest packaging company.\n", "\nIn 1989, Peltz bought out a British property developer, Mountleigh Group PLC, for $150 million. His plan to turn the company into a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/takeover.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">takeover</a> vehicle for European companies didn\u2019t pan out as intended with the real estate market crash of 1991 in Britain. Mountleigh went into <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bankruptcy.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bankruptcy</a> having incurred $950 million in debt. Peltz lost all his investment in the aftermath.\n", "\nIn 1993, Peltz purchased an interest in Triarc Companies, Inc., a financially distressed <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/holdingcompany.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">holding company</a> valued at approximately $700 million. In 1997, he made a major <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/acquisition.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">acquisition</a> of Snapple from Quaker Oats for $300 million, successfully turned the company around, and sold the beverage company three years later to Cadbury\u2019s Schweppes for more $1.45 billion in cash and debt.\n", "\nIn 2005, he co-founded Trian Fund Management, an alternate investment firm, and has made investments in companies such as Wendy\u2019s, BNY Mellon, Ingersoll Rand, Legg Mason Inc., Heinz, Kraft Foods, Family Dollar, Tiffany &amp; Co., and Domino\u2019s Pizza, in some cases using <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leveragedbuyout.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">leveraged buyout</a> techniques. Trian Fund Management now oversees more than $10 billion of assets under management (AUM), as of Feb. 2019. As a corporate raider, Nelson Peltz seeks to build value by improving the operations of the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/targetfirm.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">target firm</a>. He conducts his buyouts and acquisitions in the public traded markets where <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/common_shareholder.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ordinary shareholders</a> can benefit from positive turnouts in revised operations.\n", "\nPeltz\u00a0lost a vote to secure a board seat at consumer giant Proctor &amp; Gamble (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=pg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PG</a>), nearly three months after he made a bid for it. On July 17, 2017, Trian\u00a0had filed a preliminary proxy report with the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Securities Exchange Commission (SEC)</a> for the election of Nelson Peltz to PG's board of directors. This announcement came after the fund had increased its stake in the firm to $3.3 billion of shares. Peltz mentioned a lagging stock price as the reason for attempting to shake up the company. Given that P&amp;G is Trian\u2019s largest position in the fund, comprising of about a third of Trian\u2019s portfolio, it made sense that Peltz would want the company\u2019s share price to do better. In fact, from 2013 to October 2017, P&amp;G had only traded between $70 and $93, and during this period had a high of $93.89 at the end of 2014. From the beginning of 2015 to October 2017, the stock has lost 1.4%.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"6\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nP&amp;G was not the first behemoth that Peltz went for. In 2013, he once vied for a board seat at food and beverage giant Pepsico, which he wanted broken up by <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spinoff.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">spinning off</a> its beverage unit from the better performing snacks division. After nearly two years of battling it out, Pepsico elected Trian advisor, William R. Johnson, to its board.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"7\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff Although the company did not implement the spin off, it implemented a strategic plan that saw its stock price rise sharply in the three years following Trian\u2019s disclosure of its stake in the company. In 2016, when Peltz sold his nearly $2 billion stake in Pepsico, he walked away with a 50% <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnoninvestment.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">return on his investment</a>.\n", "\nIn March 2017, Forbes listed Nelson Peltz as one of the 25 Highest-Earning hedge fund managers in 2016. The hedge fund, Trian Partners Master Fund, managed by Trian Fund, returned 11% net of fees in 2016 according to Forbes.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"10\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nPeltz\u2019s net worth as of September 2020 is over $1.7 billion.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"9\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nPeltz is married to Claudia Heffner and has 10 children.
