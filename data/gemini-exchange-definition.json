Like other digital currency exchanges, Gemini allows users to buy and sell a variety of digital currencies, either with digital currency (for example, using bitcoin to buy Litecoin) or using fiat currency like U.S. dollars to buy digital currencies.\n", "\nGemini boasts a diverse range of products for small investors and advanced traders, offering features like charting and instant trades. Gemini Exchange is <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/tech/gemini-winklevoss-bitcoin-exchange/\">Gemini's platform</a> for buying and selling cryptocurrency. It is available both through web browsers and as an app. The mobile app also includes the Gemini Wallet, which allows users to pay for goods using their crypto holdings.\n", "\nFor advanced traders, Gemini offers its Active Trader Platform. According to its <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://gemini.com/activetrader\" rel=\"nofollow\">website</a>, the platform features \"advanced charting, multiple order types, auctions, and block trading.\" They also claim to be able to execute orders in \"microseconds,\" but that may depend on how you define \"execute\" and what kind of cryptocurrency you're trading.\n", "\nThe <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"https://gemini.com/custody\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gemini Custody</a> product is both a cold storage system for assets held by Gemini and a \"crypto-native finance platform.\" The custody product is unique in that it provides insurance coverage of $200 million for crypto holdings and is a fiduciary and custodian licensed under New York Banking law, making Gemini arguably the most secure crypto exchange that has ever existed. Gemini also is a clearinghouse for off-exchange trades.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\"></span>\n", "\nThe Gemini Exchange set itself apart in early May 2016 when it became the first licensed <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ethereum.asp\">Ethereum</a> exchange in the United States.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\"></span> In May 2018, Gemini became <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/news/winklevoss-gemini-add-zcash-litecoin/\">the world's first exchange</a> to be licensed to offer Zcash trading as well.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\"></span> This announcement followed a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/news/winklevoss-gemini-fund-offer-bitcoin-ethereum-block-trading/\">report</a> that Gemini began to offer block trading in April 2018, allowing users to buy and sell large orders of digital currencies outside of Gemini's usual order books. Block trading was implemented in order to create additional liquidity opportunities.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\"></span>\n", "\nGemini has expanded its partnerships with other organizations and companies. The most notable of these is Gemini's partnership with Nasdaq, announced in April 2018. Through this collaboration, Gemini will utilize Nasdaq's SMARTS technology in order to weed out fraudulent activity and manipulation of digital currency prices. Besides the Nasdaq partnership, Gemini also partnered with Caspian, the digital currency trading and risk-management service.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"5\"></span>\n", "\nAs with most digital currency exchanges, Gemini has seen its share of issues. In late November 2017, for instance, Gemini crashed for several hours in the wake of unusually high demands on its website. Rival exchange <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coinbase.asp\">Coinbase</a> also crashed around the same time.
