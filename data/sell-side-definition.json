The sell-side can also include private capital market instruments such as private placements of debt and equity. Sell-side individuals and firms work to create and service products that are made available to the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/buyside.asp\">buy-side</a>\u00a0of the financial industry. The sell-side of Wall Street includes investment bankers, who serve as intermediaries between issuers of securities and the investing public, and the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketmaker.asp\">market makers</a>\u00a0who provide\u00a0liquidity\u00a0in the public market.

Individual investors are technically on the buy-side. In the private market, private equity funds, VC funds, and venture arms of corporations investing in startups are on the buy-side. However, the term mostly applies to professional money managers. On the sell-side of the equation are the market makers who are the driving force of the financial market. For example, any individual or firm that purchases stock to sell it later at a profit is from the buy-side.\u00a0\n", "\nThe FX market is the world's largest financial marketplace, with more than an estimated $6.6 trillion changing hands daily, as of 2019.
