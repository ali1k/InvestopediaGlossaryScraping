The hierarchy represents the progression of learning and decision-making consumer experiences as a result of advertising. A hierarchy-of-effects model is used to set up a structured series of advertising message objectives for a particular product, to build upon each successive objective until a sale is ultimately made. The objectives of a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketing-campaign.asp\">campaign</a> are (in order of delivery): awareness, knowledge, liking, preference, conviction, and purchase.\n", "\nThe hierarchy-of-effects theory is an advanced <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketing-strategy.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">advertising strategy</a> in that it approaches the sale of a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/goodthrough.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">good through</a> well-developed, persuasive advertising messages designed to build <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brandawareness.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">brand awareness</a> over time. While an immediate purchase would be preferred, companies using this strategy expect consumers to need a longer decision-making process. The goal of advertisers is to guide a potential customer through all six stages of the hierarchy.\n", "\nThe behaviors associated with the hierarchy-of-effects theory can be boiled down to \"think,\" \"feel,\" and \"do,\" or cognitive, affective and conative behaviors. The hierarchy-of-effects model was created by Robert J. Lavidge and Gary A. Steiner in their 1961 article <em>A Model for Predictive Measurements of Advertising Effectiveness</em>.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n"]}
