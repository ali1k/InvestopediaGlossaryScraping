The U.S. Internal Revenue System (IRS) will tax your income earned worldwide. However, if you are an American ex-pat, this means you are taxed twice on this income. The income you receive overseas, sees the foreign country tax and can be taxed again by the IRS.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nThe foreign earned income exclusion is elected on IRS tax Form 2555.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff Furthermore, taxpayers who claim this exclusion make domestic retirement plan contributions of any kind that are based on this income or claim the foreign tax credit or deduction for any taxes paid to a foreign government on this income.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nYou must meet specific qualifications to claim the foreign earned income exclusion.\n", "\nThere is a statutory maximum exclusion amount plus a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreign-housing-exclusion-deduction.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">foreign housing amount</a>\u00a0which limits the exclusion.
