A plan that minimizes how much you pay in taxes is referred to as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tax-efficiency.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tax efficient</a>. Tax planning should be an essential part of an individual investor's financial plan. Reduction of tax liability and maximizing the ability to contribute to retirement plans are crucial for success.\u00a0\n", "\nTax planning covers several considerations. Considerations include timing of income, size, and timing of purchases, and planning for other expenditures. Also, the selection of investments and types of retirement plans\u00a0must complement the tax\u00a0filing status and deductions to create the best possible outcome.\n", "\nSaving via a retirement plan is a popular way to efficiently reduce taxes. Contributing money to a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/traditionalira.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">traditional IRA</a> can minimize gross income by the amount contributed. For 2020 and 2021, if meeting all qualifications, a filer under age 50\u00a0can contribute a maximum of $6,000 to their IRA and $7,000\u00a0if age 50 or older.\u00a0For example, if a 52-year-old male with an annual income of $50,000 who\u00a0made a $7,000 contribution to a traditional IRA\u00a0has an adjusted gross income of $43,000, the $7,00 contribution would grow tax-deferred until retirement.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nThere are several other retirement plans that an individual may use to help reduce tax liability. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/401kplan.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">401(k) plans </a>are popular with larger companies that have many employees. Participants in the plan can defer income from their paycheck directly into the company\u2019s 401(k) plan. The greatest difference is that the contribution limit dollar amount is much higher than that of an IRA.\u00a0\n", "\nUsing the same example as above, the 52-year-old could contribute up to $26,000 into their 401(k). For 2020 and 2021, if under age 50, the salary contribution can be up to $19,500, or up to $26,000 if age 50 or older due to the allowed additional $6,000 catch-up contribution. This 401(k) deposit reduces adjusted gross income from $50,000 to $24,000.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxgainlossharvesting.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tax gain-loss harvesting</a> is another form of tax planning or management relating to investments. It is helpful because it can use a portfolio's losses to offset overall capital gains. According to the IRS, short and long-term capital losses must first be used to offset capital gains of the same type. In other words, long-term losses offset long-term gains before offsetting short-term gains.\u00a0Short-term capital gains, or earnings from assets owned for less than one year, are taxed at ordinary income rates.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\u00a0\n", "\nAs of 2020, long-term capital gains are taxed\u00a0as follows:\u00a0\n", "\nFor example, if a single investor whose income was $80,000 had $10,000 in long-term capital gains, there would be a tax liability of $1,500. If the same investor sold underperforming investments carrying $10,000 in long-term capital losses, the losses would offset the gains, resulting in a tax liability of 0. If the same losing investment were brought back, then a minimum of 30 days would have to pass to avoid incurring a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/washsale.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">wash sale</a>.\u00a0\n", "\nAccording to the Internal Revenue Service, \"If your capital losses exceed your capital gains, the amount of the excess loss that you can claim to lower your income is the lesser of $3,000 ($1,500 if married filing separately) or your total net loss shown on line 21 of Schedule D (Form 1040 or 1040-SR).<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nFor example, if the 52-year-old investor had $3,000 in net capital losses for the year, the $50,000 income will be adjusted to $47,000.\u00a0Remaining capital losses can be carried over with no expiration to offset future capital gains.\n"]}
