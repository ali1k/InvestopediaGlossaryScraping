Between three and six months\u2019 worth of living expenses is the ideal safety net. Financial experts generally recommend putting away 20% of each paycheck every month. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/personal-finance/how-to-build-emergency-fund/\">Once you\u2019ve filled up your emergency fund</a>, don\u2019t stop.

Of course, most people do have to borrow from time to time, and sometimes going into debt can be advantageous, if, for example, it leads to acquiring an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp\">asset</a>.

Given the extraordinary rewards incentives on offer these days (such as cash back), it makes sense to charge as many purchases as possible if you can pay your bills in full. Most important: Avoid maxing out credit cards at all costs and always pay bills on time. One of the fastest ways to ruin your <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit_score.asp\">credit score</a> is to constantly pay bills late\u2014or even worse, miss payments (see tip five).\n", "\nUsing a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debitcard.asp\">debit card</a>, which takes money directly from your bank account, is another way to ensure that you will not be paying for accumulated small purchases over an extended period with interest.\n", "\nCredit cards are the main vehicle through which your credit score is built and maintained, so watching credit spending goes hand in hand with monitoring your credit score.

Say your net earnings are $60,000 per year and your monthly living expenses\u2014housing, food, transportation, and the like\u2014amount to $3,200 per month. There are choices to make surrounding your remaining $1,800 in monthly salary. Ideally, the first step is to establish an emergency fund or perhaps a tax-advantaged <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hsa.asp\">health savings account (HSA)</a>\u2014to be eligible for one, your health insurance must be a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hdhp.asp\">high-deductible health plan (HDHP)</a>\u2014to meet <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outofpocket.asp\">out-of-pocket </a>medical expenses.

The average investor would do well to set a target on profit-taking and abide by it. As an example, imagine that you bought Apple Inc. stock in February 2016 at $93 and vowed to sell when it crossed $110, as it did two months later. Alas, when it did, you broke that vow and held on to the stock. It went back down, and you ended up exiting the position in July 2016 at $97, giving up gains of $13 per share and the possible opportunity for profit from another investment.\n", "\nThree years out of college, you\u2019ve established the emergency fund, and it is time to reward yourself.

Putting off investing for one year, however, can have significant consequences. The opportunity cost of buying the watercraft can be illustrated through the above-mentioned time value of money. The $3,000 used to buy the Jet Ski would have amounted to nearly $49,000 in 40 years at 7% interest, a reasonable average annual return for a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/which-option-better-mutual-fund-growth-option-dividend-reinvestment-option/\">growth mutual fund</a> over the long haul. Thus, delaying the decision to invest wisely may likewise delay the ability to reach your goal of retiring at age 62.\n", "\nDoing tomorrow what you could do today also extends to debt payment. A $3,000 credit card balance takes 222 months (that\u2019s 18.5 years) to retire if the minimum payment of $75 is made each month. And don't forget the interest you\u2019re paying: At an 18% annual percentage rate (APR), it comes to $3,923 over those months.

For one, many young adults and students need to think about paying for the biggest expenses of their lifetime, such as a new car, home, or post-secondary education. Taking away potentially 10% to 20% of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/available-funds.asp\">available funds</a> would be a definite setback in making those purchases.\n", "\nAdditionally, saving for retirement doesn\u2019t make a whole lot of sense if you have credit cards or interest-bearing loans that need to be paid off. The 19% interest rate on your Visa card would probably negate the returns you get from your balanced mutual fund retirement portfolio five times over.\n", "\nFinally, saving some money to travel and experience new places and cultures can be especially rewarding for a young person who\u2019s still not sure about their path in life.\n", "\nThe rule of thumb for young investors is that they should have a long-term outlook and stick to a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/buyandhold.asp\">buy-and-hold</a> philosophy. This rule is one of the easier ones to justify breaking. Being able to adapt to changing markets can be the difference between making money or limiting your losses versus sitting idly by and watching as your hard-earned savings shrink. Short-term investing has its advantages at any age.\n", "\nNow, if you\u2019re no longer married to the idea of long-term investing, you can stick to safer investments as well. The logic was that as young investors have such a long investment time horizon, they should be investing in higher risk ventures; after all, they have the rest of their lives to recover from any losses they may suffer. However, if you don\u2019t want to take on undue risk in your short- to medium-term investments, you don\u2019t have to. The idea of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/diversification.asp\">diversification</a> is an important part of creating a strong investment portfolio; this includes both the riskiness of individual stocks and their intended <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investment_horizon.asp\">investment horizon</a>.\n", "\nAt the other end of the age spectrum, investors near and at retirement are encouraged to cut back to the safest investments, even though these may yield less than inflation, in order to preserve capital. It\u2019s important to take fewer risks as the number of years you have to earn money and recover from bad financial times dwindles, but at age 60 or 65 you could have 20, 30, or even more years to go. Some growth investments <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/090915/are-your-investments-right-your-age.asp\">could still make sense for you</a>.\n"]}
