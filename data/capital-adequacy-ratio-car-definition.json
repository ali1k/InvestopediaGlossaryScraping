The capital adequacy ratio, also known as capital-to-risk weighted assets ratio (CRAR), is used to protect depositors and promote the stability and efficiency of financial systems around the world. Two types of capital are measured: <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tier1capital.asp\">tier-1 capital</a>, which can absorb losses without a bank being required to cease trading, and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tier2capital.asp\">tier-2 capital</a>, which can absorb losses in the event of a winding-up and so provides a lesser degree of protection to depositors.\n", "\nThe capital adequacy ratio is calculated by dividing a bank's capital by its risk-weighted assets.

Tier-1 capital is used to absorb losses and does not require a bank to cease operations. Tier-1 capital is the capital that is permanently and easily available to cushion losses suffered by a bank without it being required to stop operating. A good example of a bank\u2019s tier one capital is its ordinary share capital.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tier2capital.asp\">Tier-2 capital</a>\u00a0comprises unaudited retained earnings, unaudited reserves and general loss reserves. This capital absorbs losses in the event of a company\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/windingup.asp\">winding up</a>\u00a0or liquidating. Tier-2 capital is the one that cushions losses in case the bank is winding up, so it provides a lesser degree of protection to depositors and creditors. It is used to absorb losses if a bank loses all its Tier-1 capital.\n", "\nThe two capital tiers are added together and divided by risk-weighted assets to calculate a bank's capital adequacy ratio.\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskweightedassets.asp\">Risk-weighted assets</a>\u00a0are calculated by looking at a bank's loans, evaluating the risk and then assigning a weight. When measuring <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-exposure.asp\">credit exposures</a>, adjustments are made to the value of assets listed on a lender\u2019s balance sheet.\n", "\nAll of the loans the bank has issued are weighted based on their degree of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditrisk.asp\">credit risk</a>. For example, loans issued to the government are weighted at 0.0%, while those given to individuals are assigned a weighted score of 100.0%.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskweightedassets.asp\">Risk-weighted assets</a> are used to determine the minimum amount of capital that must be held by banks and other institutions to reduce the risk of\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insolvency.asp\">insolvency</a>.

For example, a loan that is secured by a\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"5\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/letterofcredit.asp\">letter of credit</a>\u00a0is considered to be riskier and requires more capital than a mortgage loan that is secured with collateral.\n", "\nThe reason minimum capital adequacy ratios (CARs) are critical is to make sure that banks have enough cushion to absorb a reasonable amount of losses before they become insolvent and consequently lose depositors\u2019 funds. The capital adequacy ratios ensure the efficiency and stability of a nation\u2019s financial system by lowering the risk of banks becoming insolvent. Generally, a bank with a high capital adequacy ratio is considered safe and likely to meet its financial obligations.\n", "\nDuring the process of winding-up, funds belonging to depositors are given a higher priority than the bank\u2019s capital, so depositors can only lose their savings if a bank registers a loss exceeding the amount of capital it possesses. Thus the higher the bank\u2019s capital adequacy ratio, the higher the degree of protection of depositor's assets.\n", "\nOff-balance sheet agreements, such as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreign-exchange.asp\">foreign exchange</a> contracts and guarantees, also have credit risks. Such exposures are converted to their credit equivalent figures and then weighted in a similar fashion to that of on-balance sheet credit exposures. The <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/off-balance-sheet-obs.asp\">off-balance sheet</a> and on-balance sheet credit exposures are then lumped together to obtain the total risk-weighted credit exposures.\n", "\nCurrently, the minimum ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets is 8% under\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/baselii.asp\">Basel II</a>\u00a0and 10.5%\u00a0under Basel III. High capital adequacy ratios are above the minimum requirements under Basel II and Basel III.\n", "\nMinimum capital adequacy ratios\u00a0are critical in\u00a0ensuring that\u00a0banks have enough cushion to absorb a reasonable amount of losses before they become insolvent and consequently lose depositors\u2019 funds.\n", "\nFor example, suppose bank ABC has $10 million in tier-1 capital and $5 million in tier-two capital. It has loans that have been weighted and calculated as $50 million. The capital adequacy ratio of bank ABC is 30% ($10 million + $5 million) / $50 million). Therefore, this bank has a high capital adequacy ratio and is considered to be safer. As a result, Bank ABC is less likely to become insolvent if unexpected losses occur.\n", "\nBoth the capital adequacy ratio and the solvency ratio provide ways to evaluate a company's debt versus its revenues situation. However, the\u00a0capital adequacy ratio is usually applied specifically to evaluating banks, while the solvency ratio metric can be used for evaluating any type of company.\n", "\nThe\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/solvencyratio.asp\">solvency ratio</a>\u00a0is a debt evaluation metric that can be applied to any type of company to assess how well it can cover both its short-term and long-term outstanding financial obligations. Solvency ratios below 20% indicate an increased likelihood of default.\n", "\nAnalysts often favor the solvency ratio for providing a comprehensive evaluation of a company's financial situation, because it measures actual cash flow rather than net income, not all of which may be readily available to a company to meet obligations. The solvency ratio is best employed in comparison with similar firms within the same industry, as certain industries tend to be significantly more debt-heavy than others.\n", "\nA related capital adequacy ratio sometimes considered is the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tier-1-leverage-ratio.asp\">tier-1\u00a0leverage ratio</a>.\u00a0The tier-1 leverage ratio is the relationship between a bank's\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/core-capital.asp\">core capital</a>\u00a0and its total assets. It\u00a0is calculated by dividing Tier-1 capital by a bank's average total consolidated assets and certain off-balance sheet exposures.

By including such economic realities as expected losses, this measurement is thought to represent a more realistic appraisal of a bank's actual financial health and risk level.\n"]}
