Shareholders receive a proxy ballot in the mail along with an information booklet called a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proxystatement.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">proxy statement</a>, which describes the issues to be voted on during the meeting. Shareholders vote on a variety of issues including the election of board members, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/merger.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">merger</a> or acquisition approvals, or approving a stock compensation plan.\n", "\nRegistered <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investment-management.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">investment management</a> companies may also cast proxy votes on behalf of mutual fund shareholders or high net worth investors in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/mutualfund/08/managed-separate-account.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">separately managed accounts</a>.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/publiccompany.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Publicly-traded companies</a> report their activities to shareholders through their annual meetings. Before those meetings, shareholders receive information on topics to be voted on at the meeting, such as share ownership, the structure of the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/boardofdirectors.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">board of directors</a> (BOD), and executive salary and benefits.

The winning candidate simply needs more votes than their competitor in a plurality vote. Therefore, an unopposed director only needs one vote to be elected. If <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholder.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">shareholders</a> are opposed to the candidate, they may withhold their voting rights.\n", "\nIn some instances, the decision is made based on a majority voting system. When a majority vote applies, directors need to receive a majority of the votes in order to be elected.
