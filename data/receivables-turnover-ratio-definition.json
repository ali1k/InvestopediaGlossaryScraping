interpret the ratio to mean that Company A collected its receivables 11.76 times on average that year. In other words, the company converted its receivables to cash 11.76 times that year. A company could compare several years to ascertain whether 11.76 is an improvement or an indication of a slower collection process.\n", "\nA company could also determine the average duration of accounts receivable or the number of days it takes to collect them during the year. In our example above, we would divide 365 by 11.76 to arrive at the average duration. The average accounts receivable turnover in days would be 365 / 11.76, which is 31.04 days.\n", "\nFor Company A, customers on average take 31 days to pay their receivables. If the company had a 30-day payment policy for its customers, the average accounts receivable turnover shows that, on average, customers are paying one day late.\n", "\nA company could improve its turnover ratio by making changes to its collection process. A company could also offer its customers discounts for paying early. Companies need to know their receivables turnover since it is directly tied to how much cash they have available to pay their short-term liabilities.\n", "\nThe <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetturnover.asp\">asset turnover ratio</a> measures the value of a company's sales or\u00a0revenues\u00a0relative to the value of its\u00a0assets. The asset turnover ratio is an indicator of the efficiency with which a company is using its assets to generate revenue.\n", "\nThe higher the asset turnover ratio, the more efficient the company. Conversely, if a company has a low asset turnover ratio, it indicates that the company is inefficiently using its assets to generate sales.\n", "\nLike any metric attempting to gauge the efficiency of a business, the receivables turnover ratio comes with a set of limitations that are important for any investor to consider.\n", "\nFor example, some companies use total sales instead of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/netsales.asp\">net sales</a> when calculating their turnover ratio, which inflates the results. While this is not always necessarily meant to be deliberately misleading, investors should try to ascertain how a company calculates its ratio, or calculate the ratio independently.\n", "\nAnother limitation of the receivables turnover ratio is that accounts receivables can vary dramatically throughout the year. For example, seasonal companies will likely have periods with high receivables along with perhaps a low turnover ratio and periods when the receivables are fewer and can be more easily managed and collected.\n", "\nIn other words, if an investor chooses a starting and ending point for calculating the receivables turnover ratio arbitrarily, the ratio may not reflect the company's effectiveness of issuing and collecting credit. As such, the beginning and ending values selected when calculating the average accounts receivable should be carefully chosen to accurately reflect the company's performance. Investors could take an average of accounts receivable from each month during a 12-month period to help smooth out any seasonal gaps.\n", "\nAny comparisons of the turnover ratio should be made with companies that are in the same industry and, ideally, have similar <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/businessmodel.asp\">business models</a>. Companies of different sizes may often have very different <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalstructure.asp\">capital structures</a>, which can greatly influence turnover calculations, and the same is often true of companies in different industries.\n", "\nLastly, a low receivables turnover might not necessarily indicate that the company\u2019s issuing of credit and collecting of debt is lacking. For example, if the company's distribution division is operating poorly, it might be failing to deliver the correct goods to customers in a timely manner. As a result, customers might delay paying their receivables, which would decrease the company\u2019s receivables turnover ratio.\n"]}
