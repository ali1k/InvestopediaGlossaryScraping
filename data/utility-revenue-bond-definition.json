Due to the necessity of these services, it\u00a0is common for utility revenue bonds to feature a net revenue pledge, as upkeep must be implemented to maintain them in good working order.\n", "\nIt is also common for utilities to be required to maintain a specific revenue-to-expenditure ratio. The inclusion of debt repayment is as an expense, and the ratio is often used to support customer rate increases for public utilities.\n", "\nMunicipal bonds repay\u00a0bondholders through either municipal taxation, as in a\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/generalobligationbond.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">general obligation bond</a>,\u00a0or through <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/revenuebond.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">revenue bonds</a>. Revenue bonds derive income from the capital project. The issuer of general obligation bonds guarantees the repayment of debt via any means necessary. To collect funds, the issuer can raise taxes, issue another round of bonds, or even sell physical assets. The issuer is not constrained to a single revenue stream to satisfy obligations. Investors should be aware of this distinction and can use it as they build a diversified, fixed-income portfolio.\u00a0\n", "\nOther factors come into play when <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/bonds/09/history-credit-rating-agencies.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">credit ratings agencies</a> or investors evaluate utility revenue bonds and the projects they finance.

Population size and trends can provide an idea of future revenue growth or decline for a utility project.\u00a0\n", "\nCustomer concentration describes the mix of consumers whose usage fees support debt repayment. If a small number of consumers use a significant portion of a public utility's service, that may lead to risk for the viability of that project's revenues.\n"]}
