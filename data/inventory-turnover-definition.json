Analysts divide COGS by average inventory, instead of sales, for greater accuracy in the inventory turnover calculation because sales include a markup over cost. Dividing sales by average inventory inflates inventory turnover. In both situations, average inventory is used to help remove seasonality effects.\n", "\nInventory turnover measures how fast a company sells inventory. A low turnover implies weak sales and possibly excess inventory, also known as overstocking. It may indicate a problem with the goods being offered for sale or be a result of too little marketing.\n", "\nA high ratio, on the other hand, implies either strong sales or insufficient inventory. The former is desirable while the latter could lead to lost business.\n", "\nThe speed at which a company can sell inventory is a critical measure of business performance. Retailers that move inventory out faster tend to outperform. The longer an item is held, the higher its holding cost will be, and the fewer reasons consumers will have to return to the shop for new items.\n", "\nA good example can be seen in the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fast-fashion.asp\">fast fashion</a> business. Companies such as H&amp;M and Zara typically limit runs and replace depleted inventory quickly with new items. Slow-selling items equate to higher holding costs compared to the faster-selling inventory. There is also the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/opportunitycost.asp\">opportunity cost</a> of low inventory turnover; an item that takes a long time to sell prevents the placement of newer items that may sell more readily.\n", "\nInventory turnover is an especially important piece of data for maximizing efficiency in the sale of perishable and other time-sensitive goods. Some examples could be milk, eggs, produce, fast fashion, automobiles, and periodicals.\n", "\nAn overabundance of cashmere sweaters may lead to unsold inventory and lost profits, especially as seasons change and retailers restock with new, seasonal inventory. Such unsold stock is known as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/obsoleteinventory.asp\">obsolete inventory</a> or dead stock.\n", "\nSome retailers may employ an open-to-buy system as they seek to manage their inventories and the replenishment of their inventories more efficiently. Open-to-buy systems, at their core, are software budgeting systems for purchasing merchandise. Such a system can be used to monitor merchandise and may be integrated into a retailer's financing and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/best-inventory-management-software-5088863\">inventory control processes</a>.\n", "\nIt can help small retailers better manage decisions on how much inventory to buy, how to evaluate how inventory is performing, and assist with future inventory procurement. Such software may be tailored to some degree but may not be useful for all types of merchandise. For example, it may work best with seasonal merchandise and fashion, but may not be a good fit for fast-selling consumer goods or basic items and staples.\n", "\nAssume Company ABC has $1 million in sales and $250,000 in COGS. The average inventory is $25,000. Using this information, we can see that the company has an inventory turnover of 40, or $1 million divided by $25,000. In other words, within a year Company ABC tends to turn over its inventory 40 times.\n", "\nTaking it a step further, dividing 365 days by the inventory turnover shows how many days on average it takes a company to sell its inventory. In the case of Company ABC, it\u2019s 9.1.\n", "\nAlternatively, using the other method\u2014COGS / average inventory\u2014the inventory turnover is 10, or $250,000 in COGS divided by $25,000 in inventory. Inventory is on hand for 36.5 days under this approach, or 365 / 10.\n", "\nInventory turnover shows how quickly a company can sell (turn over) its inventory. Meanwhile, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/days-sales-inventory-dsi.asp\">days of inventory</a> (DSI) looks at the average time a company can turn its inventory into sales.\n", "\nDSI is essentially the inverse of inventory turnover for a given period, calculated as (inventory / COGS) * 365. Basically, DSI is the number of days it takes to turn inventory into sales, while inventory turnover determines how many times in a year inventory is sold or used.\n", "\nWhen comparing or projecting inventory turnover, one must compare similar products and businesses. For example, automobile turnover at a car dealer may turn over far slower than <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fastmoving-consumer-goods-fmcg.asp\">fast-moving consumer goods</a> (FMCG) sold by a supermarket (snacks, sweets, soft drinks, etc.).\n", "\nTrying to manipulate inventory turnover with discounts or closeouts is another consideration, as it can significantly cut into <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnoninvestment.asp\">return on investment</a> (ROI) and profitability.\n", "\nInventory turnover is a measure of how quickly a company sells its inventory in a year and is often used as a metric of overall operational efficiency.\n", "\nThere are two popular ways of calculating inventory turnover. The first method consists of dividing the company\u2019s annual sales by its average inventory balance, whereas the second method divides annual cost of goods sold (COGS) by average inventory. In either case, the average inventory balance is often estimated by taking the sum of beginning and ending inventory for the year and dividing it by 2.\n", "\nWhat counts as a \u201cgood\u201d inventory turnover will depend on the industry in question. As a general rule, industries stocking products that are relatively inexpensive will tend to have higher inventory turnovers, whereas more expensive items\u2014where customers usually take more time before making a purchase decision\u2014will tend to have lower inventory turnovers.\n", "\nFor instance, a company selling cheap products might sell the equivalent of 30 times their inventory in a year, whereas a company selling large industrial machinery might only cycle through their inventory 3 times. Inventory turnover ratios, therefore, need to be assessed relative to a company\u2019s industry and competitors in order to tell whether they are good or bad.\n", "\nCompanies will almost always aspire to have a high inventory turnover. After all, a high inventory turnover reduces the amount of capital they have tied up in their inventory, thereby improving their liquidity and financial strength. Moreover, keeping a high inventory turnover reduces the risk that their inventory will become unsellable due to spoilage, damage, theft, or technological obsolescence.\n"]}
