It could also focus on more cultural aspects, such as a global fast-food chain offering geographically-specific menu items that cater to local tastes.\n", "\nOften,\u00a0glocalization\u00a0campaigns involve culturally friendly media and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/insurance/020117/look-geicos-marketing-strategy.asp\">ad campaigns</a> to encourage\u00a0the acceptance of foreign products among a local audience.\n", "\n<strong>[Important: While glocalization helps customize an international corporation's products to a particular culture or geography, it must also pay attention to the risk of perceived cultural appropriation.]</strong>\n", "\nGlocalization is the adaptation of global and international products, into the local contexts they're used and sold in. The term was coined in\u00a0the Harvard Business Review, in 1980, by sociologist Roland Robertson, who wrote that glocalization meant \"the simultaneity\u2014the co-presence\u2014of both universalizing and particularizing tendencies.\"\n", "\nIn regards to a particular product or\u00a0service, this means the adaptation of\u00a0globally marketed products and services into local markets. A\u00a0global product or service, something everyone needs and can get used out of, may be tailored to conform with local laws, customs, or consumer preferences. Products that are \"glocalized\" are, by definition, going to be of much greater interest to the end user, the person who ends up using the product.\u00a0This is because while it's something that everyone can use and has use for, as a global product, it's localization makes it more specific to an individual, their context, and their needs.\n", "\nGlocalization works for companies with <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/042015/why-governments-are-afraid-bitcoin.asp\">decentralized authority</a> structures, and for companies that exist and compete in multiple, different cultural contexts. The process can be expensive, and resource intensive, but it often pays off for companies that practice it, as it allows for greater access to a larger, more culturally varied target market. It also makes those countries more effective competitors in those markets.\n", "\nIf globalization was charged with cultural homogenization, glocalization\u00a0is something of an answer to it. Glocalization\u00a0can be\u00a0thought of as the opposite, or the inverse, of\u00a0Americanization, too,\u00a0which is the influence that American culture and business has on another country's\u00a0culture.\u00a0\n", "\nThis has mixed results for the larger economy. In making these companies more effective competitors, it should increase the quality of competition and\u00a0drive down prices, making goods more accessible.\n", "\nHowever, since glocalization is generally the practice of large\u00a0multinational corporations, driving the price down and taking a big share of the market, the process can hurt smaller, local businesses, struggling to compete with these corporations low costs of production. This can result in less competition, and end up driving prices up.\n"]}
