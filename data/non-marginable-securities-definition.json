They must be fully funded by the investor's cash.\n", "\nMost brokerage firms have internal lists of non-marginable securities, which investors can find online or by contacting their institutions. These lists will be adjusted over time to reflect changes in share prices and volatility.\u00a0Holdings in non-marginable securities do not add to the investor's margin buying power.\n", "\nThe main goal of keeping some securities away from margin investors is to mitigate risk and control the administrative costs of excessive <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margincall.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">margin calls</a> on what are usually volatile stocks with uncertain cash flows.\n", "\nExamples of non-marginable securities include recent initial public offerings (IPOs). When a news outlet reports a company is making the first-ever offer to sell shares to the public, this is known as an IPO. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otcbb.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Over-the-counter bulletin board</a> stocks and penny stocks, which are stocks that generally trade per share for under $5 and are owned by small companies, are also non-marginable securities\u00a0by decree of the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/frb.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Federal Reserve Board</a>.\u00a0\n", "\nOther securities, such as stocks with share prices that are under $5, or that are extremely volatile, may be excluded at the discretion of the broker.
