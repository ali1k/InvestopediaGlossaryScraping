The term \"vendor\" is typically used to describe the entity that is paid for goods that are provided, rather than the manufacturer of the goods itself. However, it is possible for a vendor to operate as both a supplier (or seller) of goods and a manufacturer.\n", "\nA vendor, also known as a supplier, is a person or a business entity that <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sell.asp\">sells</a> something. Large retail store chains such as Target, for example, generally have a list of vendors from which they purchase goods at wholesale prices that they then sell at retail prices to their customers.\n", "\nSome vendors also can sell directly to the customer, as seen with street vendors and food trucks. In addition, a vendor can act as a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/btob.asp\">business-to-business</a> (B2B) sales organization that provides parts of a product to\u00a0another business to make an end product.\n", "\nA <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/manufacturing.asp\">manufacturer that turns raw material into a finished good</a> is a vendor to wholesalers and retailers that sell the product to a consumer. In turn, retailers are a vendor for the end customer. For example, Target is a vendor for a person looking for home appliances or other products.\n", "\nLarge corporate events are also good examples of times when vendors are needed. If, for example, the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/humanresources.asp\">human resources department</a> of a large company plans a holiday party for its employees, it seeks to hire outside vendors to supply goods and services for the event. First, the department must choose a location, in which case\u00a0the owner of the event space itself becomes a vendor when the date is reserved and the contract signed.\n", "\nAfter that, the human resources department reaches out to decorators, which\u00a0become vendors when they are hired to transform the event space into a themed party. After the theme is implemented, a catering company is contracted to provide food and beverages for the party. When the company delivers its service, it becomes a vendor to the company hosting the party.\n", "\nVendors are found throughout the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/supplychain.asp\">supply chain</a>, which is the sum\u00a0of all individuals, organizations, resources, activities, and technologies used in the manufacturing and selling of a product\u00a0or service. The supply chain starts with the production and delivery of raw source material. It ends with the sale and final delivery of the product.\n", "\nManufacturers and retailers try to eliminate as much of the supply chain as possible, as they know that the final cost of a product increases with each link in the supply chain. Typically, the supply chain consists of three parts: a manufacturer, a seller, and a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/value-added-reseller.asp\">reseller</a> or, as they are more commonly known, a retailer.\n"]}
