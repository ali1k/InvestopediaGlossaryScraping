In the United States, the Federal Reserve transacts repos and reverse repos under its open market operations.\n", "\nThe RBI introduced the LAF as a result of the\u00a0Narasimham Committee on Banking Sector Reforms (1998).\u00a0\n", "\nLiquidity adjustment facilities are used to aid banks in resolving any short-term cash <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortage.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">shortages</a> during periods of economic instability or from any other form of stress caused by forces beyond their control. Various banks use eligible securities as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/collateral.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">collateral</a> through a repo agreement and use the funds to alleviate their short-term requirements, thus remaining stable.\n", "\nThe facilities are implemented on a day-to-day basis as banks and other financial institutions ensure they have enough capital in the overnight market.

It does so by increasing the repo rate, which raises the cost of servicing debt. This, in turn, reduces investment and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/moneysupply.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">money supply</a> in India\u2019s economy.\n", "\nConversely, if the RBI is trying to stimulate the economy after a period of slow economic growth, it can lower the repo rate to encourage businesses to borrow, thus increasing the money supply. Recently, the RBI cut the repo rate by 40 <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/what-basis-point-bps/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">basis points</a> in May 2020 to 4.00% from 4.40% previously, due to weak economic activity, benign inflation, and slower global growth. At the same time, the reverse repo rate was cut to 3.35% from 3.75%, also a decline of 40 basis points. The cuts mirror monetary policy decisions made by central banks around the world in the spring and summer of 2020, as governments have attempted to temper the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n", "\nLet\u2019s assume a bank has a short-term cash shortage due to a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/recession.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">recession</a> gripping the Indian economy. The bank would use the RBI's liquidity adjustment facility by executing a repo agreement by selling <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/governmentsecurity.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">government securities</a> to the RBI in return for a loan with an agreement to repurchase those securities back. For example, say the bank needs a one-day loan for 50,000,000 <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inr.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Indian rupees</a> and executes a repo agreement at 6.25%. The bank's payable interest on the loan is \u20b98,561.64 (\u20b950,000,000 x 6.25% / 365).\n", "\nNow let\u2019s suppose the economy is expanding and a bank has excess cash on hand. In this case, the bank would execute a reverse repo agreement by making a loan to the RBI in exchange for government securities, in which it agrees to repurchase those securities. For example, the bank may have \u20b925,000,000 available to loan the RBI and decides to execute a one-day reverse repo agreement at 6%. The bank would receive \u20b94109.59 in interest from the RBI (\u20b925,000,000 x 6% / 365).\n"]}
