In other words, if the underlying security such as a stock has moved in price, an investor would not be able to exercise the option early and take delivery of or sell the shares.

In this case, the investor would receive the net difference between the two premiums.\n", "\nClosing the option position before expiration means the trader realizes any gains or losses on the contract itself.

The increased cost of the option means investors need the underlying asset to move far enough from the strike price to make the trade return a profit.\n", "\nAlso, if an American option is held to maturity, the investor would have been better off buying a lower-priced, European version option and paying the lower premium.\n", "\nAn investor purchases a July call option on Citigroup Inc. with a $50 strike price.

Since the stock is trading below the strike of $50, the option isn't exercised and expires worthless.
