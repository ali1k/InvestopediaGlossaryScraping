Milken was an executive at investment bank Drexel Burnham Lambert during the 1980s and used high-yield junk bonds for corporate financing and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mergersandacquisitions.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mergers and acquisitions</a>. Milken amassed an enormous personal fortune and was indicted in 1989 by a federal grand jury and eventually spent nearly two years in prison after pleading guilty to securities fraud charges. While he is credited with founding the high-yield debt market, he was banned for life from the securities industry. On Feb. 18, 2020, President Trump granted him a full pardon.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nMilken joined Drexel Burnham Lambert in 1969. During his time with the firm, he started trading in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/high_yield_bond.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">high-yield bonds</a>, which earned him the nickname Junk Bond King in the 1980s. These bonds provide much-needed <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">capital</a> for companies that don't necessarily have ready access to credit. During his time at the firm, he raised a huge amount of money from a sizable base of interested investors. This allowed him to expand his high-yield bond department eventually. At the height of his success, Milken earned between $200 million and $550 million a year.\n", "\nOn April 24, 1990, Milken\u00a0pleaded guilty to five technical counts of violating securities laws. He was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison but was released after two years for good behavior. He was also fined $600 million. Since his release,\u00a0Milken has been remaking his image and is attempting to secure a pardon for the charges he plead guilty to in 1990.\n", "\nFollowing his release from prison, he worked as a strategic consultant. This violated his probation, and he was subsequently fined $42 million for these actions. In 1993, Milken was diagnosed with prostate cancer. Since then, he has devoted much of his time and resources to pursue a cure for the disease.\n", "\nAccording to <em>Forbes</em>, Milken's net worth is estimated at $3.7 billion as of Jan. 25, 2021.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff He co-founded the nonprofit Milken Family Foundation and the Milken Institute, an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economic-think-tank.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">economic think tank</a> that hosts conferences around health, politics, media, and culture.\n", "\nEarly in his career, Milken saw an opportunity to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leverage.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">leverage</a> junk bonds, also known as high-yield bonds. He saw a way for investors to see high returns\u2014on a risk-adjusted basis\u2014by buying bonds issued by companies with low <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditrating.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">credit ratings</a> compared with acquiring bonds from AAA-rated companies. At the time, the availability of such bonds was limited, and Milken anticipated demand would quickly outpace supply for this investment opportunity. The firm he worked for, Drexel Burnham Lambert, launched an effort to underwrite more junk bonds by convincing such companies to issue them.\n", "\nThe companies in question may have been early-stage or otherwise not well-established. Their low credit rating may not necessarily have resulted from poor financial health but rather from a lack of an extensive track record to base their credit ratings. Such circumstances are typically seen with new and emerging industries. From the companies\u2019 perspective, issuing bonds could potentially access more capital that they might not otherwise have an opportunity to pursue. Milken\u2019s efforts at Drexel Burnham are credited with launching this <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">market.</a>\n", "\nAs the junk bond market grew, Milken sought to maintain a dominant position over this sector. Some of his efforts led to engaging in business activities that eventually led to his arrest and conviction for securities fraud.\n"]}
