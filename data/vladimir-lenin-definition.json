Through violent means he imposed a system of Marxist socialism called <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/communism.asp\">Communism</a> on the former empire that attempted a redistribution of wealth intended to abolish the aristocracy and create a more equitable society for the masses.\n", "\nA prominent Marxist, Lenin was born in 1870 in Russia with the last name Ulyanov. He picked up his political beliefs during his first, brief time in university, where he was expelled for political activity. Eventually, he was allowed to sit for his law examinations and earned a law degree. He became a public defender and part of a group of revolutionary Marxists. Eventually, his activities got him exiled to Siberia for three years, from 1897 to 1900. After that he moved to Europe, where he became a revolutionary journalist before returning to Russia for the Revolution of 1905, then leaving for Europe again during World War I.\n", "\nLenin returned to Russia in April 1917 after the czar had abdicated and the soviet revolution was underway. The country was being run by a provisional government, which Lenin termed \u201ca dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.\u201d He envisioned a \u201cdictatorship of the proletariat,\u201d in which workers and peasants ruled. Russians were in despair over the toll that World War I was taking on the country and wanted change, and that war weariness allowed Lenin and his Red Guards, a secretly organized army of peasants, workers, and disaffected Russian military men, to seize control of the government in a bloodless coup d'\u00e9tat in November 1917.\n", "\nOnce in power Lenin withdrew Russia from WW I, but his Red Army ended up fighting a three-year civil war with the White Army, a coalition of monarchists, capitalists, and democratic socialists. To fund the war, Lenin instituted something called \u201cWar Communism,\u201d which nationalized all manufacturing and industry and requisitioned grain from farmers to feed the troops and sell abroad to raise cash for the government.\n", "\nAfter an attempted assassination in 1918 in which he was seriously wounded, Lenin waged the Red Terror through the Bolshevik secret police, known as the Cheka. By some estimates more than 100,000 people thought to be against the aims of the revolution (known as \u201ccounterrevolutionaries\u201d) or simply related to those who were in opposition were murdered by the state. The Red Army vanquished the final remnants of the White Army in Crimea in November 1920.\n", "\nLenin\u2019s War Communism eventually led to economic ruin. After the Russian famine of 1921, which killed at least five million people, he introduced his New Economic Policy in an attempt to prevent a second revolution. It\u00a0permitted some private enterprise, introducing a\u00a0wage system and letting\u00a0peasants\u00a0sell produce and other goods on the open market while having to pay tax on any\u00a0earnings, either in money or raw goods.\u00a0State-owned enterprises such as steel operated on a for-profit basis.\n", "\nIn addition,\u00a0various currencies of the time\u2014including sovznaks, kerenkas, old imperial money, and\u00a0bonds\u2014were replaced by a new currency, the Russian ruble, backed by the gold standard. The country experienced hyperinflation, with wheelbarrows full of paper bills being required to buy a loaf of bread.\n", "\nLenin suffered a series of strokes between 1922 and 1924 that made it difficult for him to speak and govern. He died on January 21, 1924, barely a year after the Bolsheviks finally established the USSR, on Dec. 30, 1922, through a treaty among Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and the Transcaucasian Federation (later Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan). His body was embalmed and put on display in a mausoleum in Moscow\u2019s Red Square, where it still is today.\n", "\nA 2017 Russian poll done by the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"externalLink\" href=\"http://www.levada.ru/2017/04/19/vladimir-lenin/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Levada Center</a> found that Lenin\u2019s reputation as the father of his country is diminished but by no means undone. Fifty-six percent of Russians believe that he played an entirely or mostly positive role in Russian history, up from 40% in 2006. However, many of those polled couldn\u2019t be specific about what he had done.\n"]}
