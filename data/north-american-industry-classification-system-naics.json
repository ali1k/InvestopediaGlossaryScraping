This classification system facilitates\u00a0the comparison of statistics of all business activities across North America. Companies are classified and separated into industries that are defined by\u00a0the same or similar production processes. This system should not be confused with the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nainsurancec.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">National Association of Insurance Commissioners</a> (NAIC) or the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/naic.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">National Association of Investors Corp.</a> (NAIC).\n", "\nThe NAICS was established to replace and modernize the U.S. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sic_code.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Standard Industrial Classification</a>\u00a0system. The new system enables easier comparison\u00a0of all countries in North America. To ensure\u00a0the NAICS continues to be relevant, there is a planned\u00a0system review every five years.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nThe NAICS is a collaborative effort. The three parties responsible for the formation and continued maintenance of the NAICS are the Instituto Nacional de Estadistica y Geografia in Mexico, Statistics Canada, and the United States Office of Management and Budget\u00a0through its Economic Classification Policy Committee\u00a0and staffed by the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bea.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bureau of Economic Analysis</a>, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bls.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>\u00a0and the Census Bureau.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nThe first version of the classification system was released in 1997. A revision in 2002 included substantial changes to\u00a0the construction, wholesale trade, retail trade, and information sectors. In 2012, there was a slight\u00a0reduction in\u00a0the number of industries in the system and made modifications to some of the system\u2019s sector classifications. The latest revision, which occurred in 2017,\u00a0reduced the number of industries from 1,065 to 1,057. Changes in size standards were also included in the revision with nine industries affected.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nThe NAICS classification system allows for more flexibility than the four-digit structure of the SIC. It uses a hierarchical six-digit coding system, classifying all economic activity into 20 different industry sectors. Five of these sectors are primarily those that produce goods while\u00a0the remaining 15 sectors provide some type of service. Every company receives a primary NAICS code, indicating its main line of business. This primary code is determined by the code definition\u00a0that generates the largest revenue for a\u00a0company at a specified location in the past year.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nNAICS codes are narrowed from 20 sector codes into 99 three-digit subsector\u00a0codes, further divided into 312 four-digit industry codes, subdivided into 713 five-digit industry codes and ultimately broken down into 1,066 six-digit NAICS\u00a0codes.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nThe first two digits of a\u00a0NAICS code indicate the largest business sector in which a company operates.\u00a0The third digit designates the company\u2019s subsector and the fourth digit indicates the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/industrygroup.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">industry group</a> to which the company belongs. The fifth digit of the code reflects the company\u2019s particular industry of operation. The sixth and final digit designates\u00a0the company\u2019s specific national industry. Soybean farming, for example, has the NAICS code 111110, which is broken down to sector 11, subsector 111, industry group 1111, industry 11111, NAICS\u00a0code 111110.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n"]}
