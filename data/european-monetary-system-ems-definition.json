Differing economic and political conditions of member countries, notably the reunification of Germany, led to Britain permanently withdrawing from the European Monetary System (EMS) in 1992. Britain's withdrawal reflected and foreshadowed its insistence on independence from continental Europe, later refusing to join the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eurozone.asp\">eurozone</a>\u00a0along with Sweden and Denmark.\n", "\nMeanwhile, efforts to form a common currency and cement greater economic alliances were ramped up.

In January 1999, a unified currency, the euro, was born and came to be used by most EU member countries.
