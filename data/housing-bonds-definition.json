In addition to repaying the bond <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/principal.asp\">principal</a>, the state or locality must pay <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interest.asp\">interest</a> on the money it borrows.\u00a0Housing bonds sometimes require voter approval and can either be short- or long-term issuances.\n", "\nA municipal authority may issue debt in the form of bonds to raise capital to finance projects. The two types of municipal bonds are <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/generalobligationbond.asp\">general obligation (GO)</a> bonds and revenue bonds.\u00a0The interest payment and principal repayment of general obligation bonds are funded from the state or local government's financial coffers. These bonds are backed by the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/full-faith-credit.asp\">full faith and credit</a> of the municipal government, which may have the authority to increase taxes in order to fulfill its payment obligations on the GO bond.\u00a0Meanwhile, payment obligations on a revenue bond are backed by the projected revenue stream of the project for which the bond was issued. A housing bond is one type of a revenue bond.\n", "\nAs <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/privateactivitybond.asp\">private activity bonds (PABs)</a>, housing bonds can be issued on behalf of qualified profit and nonprofit developers to finance low-income multifamily and senior housing projects.

Furthermore, the price of a home purchased with a housing bond mortgage is limited to 90% of the average area purchase price.\n", "\nHousing bonds typically have low interest rates and can be issued as either a fixed or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/variable-rated-demand-bond.asp\">variable-rate demand obligation (VRDO)</a>.

On the other, the tax advantages offered by housing bonds are highly attractive to lenders in the upper tax brackets.\u00a0\n", "\nFor investors, the interest paid by housing bonds is exempt from federal and, at times, state income tax.
