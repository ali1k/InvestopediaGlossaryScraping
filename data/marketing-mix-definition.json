The term often refers to a common classification that began as the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/four-ps.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">four Ps</a>: product, price, placement, and promotion.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-theory/11/small-business-marketing-techniques.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Effective marketing</a> touches on a broad range of areas as opposed to fixating on one message. Doing so helps reach a wider audience, and by keeping the four Ps in mind, marketing professionals are better able to maintain focus on the things that really matter. Focusing on a marketing mix helps organizations make strategic decisions when launching new products or revising existing products.\n", "\nThe four Ps classification for developing an effective marketing strategy was first introduced in 1960 by marketing professor and author E. Jerome McCarthy.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff Depending on the industry and the target of the marketing plan, marketing managers may take various approaches to each of the four Ps. Each element can be examined independently, but in practice, they often are dependent on one another.\u00a0\n", "\nThis represents an item or service designed to satisfy customer needs and wants. To effectively market a product or service, it's important to identify what differentiates it from competing products or services. It's also important to determine if other products or services can be marketed in conjunction with it.\n", "\nThe sale price of the product reflects what consumers are willing to pay for it. Marketing professionals need to consider costs related to research and development, manufacturing, marketing, and distribution\u2014otherwise known as\u00a0cost-based pricing.\u00a0Pricing based primarily on consumers' perceived quality or value is known as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valuebasedpricing.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">value-based pricing</a>.\n", "\nThe type of product sold\u00a0is important to consider when determining areas of distribution. Basic consumer products, such as paper goods, often are readily available in many stores. Premium consumer products, however, typically are available only in select stores. Another consideration is whether to place a product in a physical store, online, or both.\n", "\nJoint marketing campaigns also are called a promotional mix. Activities might include advertising, sales promotion, personal selling, and public relations.\u00a0A key consideration should be for the budget assigned to the marketing mix. Marketing professionals carefully construct a message that often incorporates details from the other three Ps when trying to reach their <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/target-market.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">target audience</a>. Determination of the best mediums to communicate the message and decisions about the frequency of the communication also are important.\n", "\nNot all marketing is product-focused. Customer service businesses\u00a0are\u00a0fundamentally different than those based primarily on physical products, so they often will take a consumer-centric approach that incorporates additional elements to address their unique needs.\n", "\nThree additional Ps tied to this type of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/12/-making-a-small-business-marketing-plan.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">marketing mix</a> might include people, process, and physical evidence. People refer to employees who represent a company as they\u00a0interact with clients or customers. Process represents the method or flow of providing service to the clients and often incorporates monitoring service performance for customer satisfaction. Physical evidence relates to an area or space where company representatives and customers\u00a0interact. Considerations include furniture, signage, and layout.\n", "\nAdditionally, marketers often study consumers who frequently will influence strategies related to service or products. This also requires a strategy for communicating with consumers in terms of obtaining feedback and defining the type of feedback being sought.\n", "\nTraditionally, marketing commences with identifying consumers' needs and ceases with the delivery and promotion of a final product or service.\u00a0Consumer-centric marketing is more cyclical.\u00a0Reassessing the customers' needs, communicating frequently, and developing strategies to build customer loyalty are the goals.\n"]}
