Dividends are generated from the profits of the insurance company that sold the policy and are typically paid out on an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/annual-basis.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">annual basis</a> over the life of the policy. Most policies also include a final or terminal payment that is paid out when the contract matures. Some participating policies may include a guaranteed <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">dividend</a> amount, which is determined at the onset of the policy. A participating policy is also\u00a0referred to as a \"with-profits policy.\"\n", "\nParticipating policies are typically <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lifeinsurance.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">life insurance</a> contracts, such as a whole life participating policy. The dividend received by the policyholder can be used in several different ways. First, the policyholder can apply the dividend proceeds to the insurance policy's premium payment. Second, the dividend can be kept with the insurance as a deposit in order to generate interest much like a regular\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/savingsaccount.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">savings account</a>. Finally, the policyholder can simply receive the dividend payment in cash, much like a dividend payment on a stock\n", "\nInsurance companies charge premiums that are estimated to meet their expenses.\u00a0Non-participating premiums are usually lower than premiums for participating\u00a0policies.\u00a0Insurance companies charge higher\u00a0premiums on participating policies, based on conservative projections,\u00a0with the intent of returning the excess.\u00a0This has implications for the policy's tax treatment. The <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irs.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">IRS</a> has classified the payments made by the insurance company as a return on excess premium instead of dividend payouts.\n", "\nFor example, an insurance company will\u00a0base premiums on higher <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operating-cost.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">operating costs</a> and lower rates of return than are actually expected.\u00a0By operating from conservative projections, an\u00a0insurance company can\u00a0better protect against risk.\u00a0In the end, this\u00a0is better for the individual policyholder because it helps offset\u00a0their insurance company's\u00a0insolvency risk, resulting in lower long-term premiums.\u00a0Participating policies are essentially a form of risk sharing, in which\u00a0the insurance company shifts a portion of risk to policyholders.\n", "\nThough the interest rates, mortality rates and\u00a0expenses\u00a0that dividend formulas are based on change year to year, an\u00a0insurance company will not vary dividends that often.\u00a0Instead, they will alter dividend formulas periodically based on experience and anticipated future factors.\u00a0These\u00a0statements apply to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wholelife.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">whole life insurance</a>.\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/universallife.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Universal life insurance</a> policy dividend rates can adjust much more frequently, even monthly.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/participation_policy.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Participating policies</a> can cost less than non-participating policies over the long term.\u00a0With cash value policies, the dividend will typically increase as the policy\u2019s cash value increases.\u00a0From the perspective of the policyholder, whole life policies are essentially risk-free because the insurance company bears all risk \u2013\u00a0although with\u00a0participating whole life policies, the insurance company shifts some risk to the policyholder.\n", "\nHowever, the question of whether participating policies are superior to nonparticipating policies is a complex one and depends largely on individual needs. Term life insurance is generally a nonparticipating policy with low premiums. It may suit the requirements of an individual interested in providing for their beneficiaries with less payments. But individuals interested in earning regular dividends from their policy in their lifetime may opt for a participating policy.\n", "\nA participating policy enables you as a policy holder to share the profits of the insurance company. It is also known as a with-profit policy. In non-participating policies the profits are not shared and no dividends are paid to the policyholders.\n", "\nMutual companies can issue only participating policies, which allow a portion of the company's premiums to be paid out in the form of policy dividends as refunds, which makes those funds nontaxable as income.\n"]}
