Local and state governments may also offer incentive-based wellness programs aimed at promoting the health of their citizens or public employees.\n", "\nBesides improving employee productivity and decreasing sick days and leaves of absence\u2014all of which reduce <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operating-cost.asp\">operating costs</a>\u2014wellness programs may be able to lower an organization's\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/healthinsurance.asp\">health insurance</a> expenses. Employees can also benefit from wellness programs through lower health insurance premiums, decreased out-of-pocket medical expenditures, and an increased sense of well-being.\n", "\nMany companies offer in-house workout spaces or marked walking paths on the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corporate-headquarters.asp\">corporate campus</a> to encourage physical activity. Others institute no-smoking policies or policies requiring seat belt use in company vehicles.\n", "\nIn addition, organizations might create wellness-related linkages between\u00a0their wellness program\u00a0and other company benefits such as employee assistance programs (EAPs), which\u00a0help\u00a0employees get support when they are in a difficult emotional or physical situation that affects both their health and their work. EAPs connect employees to counselors, who can advise them confidentially on issues ranging from emotional distress, a difficult medical diagnosis, and personal or work-related issues to life events such as marriage or parenting.\n", "\nHealth screenings can be a\u00a0controversial component\u00a0of many company\u00a0wellness programs. Some\u00a0people contend that\u00a0tracking cholesterol, body mass index,\u00a0and other figures leads to\u00a0de facto discrimination and\u00a0heavier financial burdens placed on workers with below-average\u00a0health.\n", "\nCorporate\u00a0wellness programs\u00a0offer a variety of scheduled programs, including\u00a0stress management seminars that cover topics such as sleep to work-life balance, cooking classes, healthy recipe exchanges, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-health.asp\">financial well-being</a>, and\u00a0fitness challenges. Other components of an effective corporate wellness program might include healthy vending machines and cafeteria offerings. Healthy and appealing food might also be\u00a0served at meetings and\u00a0included in company-provided overtime meals.\n", "\nGoogle provides an example of a unique wellness program. The company offers employees massage therapy and has a massage program with more than 30 therapists throughout the United States.\n", "\nAnother corporate wellness program was created by\u00a0Draper, Inc., an Indiana-based\u00a0manufacturer of gym equipment, window shades, and projection screens. The company instituted\u00a0a 10-week weight-loss challenge called \u201cDump Your Plump,\u201d which consists of\u00a012 teams of six employees each competing to win weekly grocery gift cards. A cash prize is awarded to the overall winner.\n", "\nAs an example of a government wellness program, the state of Wisconsin started its Well Wisconsin initiative in 2018 to fill the gap in wellness programs offered by more than 70% of the state's private employers at the time. State employees, including employees of the University of Wisconsin system and UW Healthcare, among other divisions, and their families could earn $150 per adult for fulfilling three wellness activities: a health assessment survey; a physical check-up or health screening; and participation in one or more wellness activities.\n"]}
