Arrow's research has also explored the social choice theory, endogenous growth theory, collective decision making, the economics of information and the economics of racial discrimination, among other topics.\n", "\nBorn in New York City in 1921, Kenneth Arrow\u00a0taught at Stanford University, Harvard and the University of Chicago. He\u00a0earned his Ph.D. from Columbia University, with a dissertation that discussed his theorem called the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/arrows-impossibility-theorem.asp\">General Impossibility Theorem</a>. Arrow determined in this theorem that results could not be decided fairly during an election. That's because, he stated, ideal voting methods did not exist when there are more than two candidates trying to satisfy certain criteria. Arrow outlined the criteria as follows:\n", "\nThe application of Arrow's General Impossibility Theorem\u00a0has gone beyond democracy and election results. It has also been used for both welfare economics and (social) justice. It has also been linked to the liberal paradox, which was developed by economist Amartya Sen. According to Sen and his paradox, there is generally a conflict between the distribution of goods and services in a society and individual freedom in that both cannot exist at the same time.\n", "\nArrow later published a book on the same subject. Arrow is also known as one of the first economists to recognize the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/learning-curve.asp\">learning curve</a>.\n", "\nThe importance of\u00a0Arrow\u2019s theoretical insight has proven its importance\u00a0over the decades, but he contended that\u00a0his\u00a0conclusions about the workings of competitive markets held true only under ideal\u2014that is to say, unrealistic\u2014assumptions. For example, his assumptions\u00a0ruled out the existence of third-party effects. An example of such an effect would be the idea that the\u00a0sale of a product by Harry to Joe would not affect the well-being of Sally. However, this\u00a0assumption is routinely violated in the real world by\u00a0the sale of products that harm the environment, for example.\n", "\nArrow's later research translated simple ideas into elegant mathematics, which other economists extended\u00a0into unanticipated directions. One of those notions was\u00a0\u201clearning by doing,\u201d an idea\u00a0that\u00a0Arrow examined in the early 1960s. The basic idea was that\u00a0the more a company produced, the smarter it got. Decades later, economists incorporated this idea into sophisticated theories of \u201cendogenous growth,\u201d which state that\u00a0economic growth depends\u00a0on internal company policies that promote innovation and education.\n", "\nKenneth Arrow died on February 21, 2017.\n"]}
