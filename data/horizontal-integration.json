This is in contrast to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/verticalintegration.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">vertical integration</a>, where firms expand into upstream or downstream activities, which are at different stages of production.\n", "\nHorizontal integration is a competitive strategy that can create economies of scale, increase <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market-power.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">market power</a> over distributors and suppliers, increase <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/product_differentiation.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">product differentiation</a> and help businesses expand their market or enter new markets. By merging two businesses, they may be able to produce more revenue than they would have been able to do independently.\n", "\nHowever, when <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/horizontalmerger.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">horizontal mergers</a> succeed, it is often at the expense of consumers, especially if they reduce competition. If horizontal mergers within the same industry concentrate market share among a small number of companies, it creates an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/oligopoly.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">oligopoly</a>. If one company ends up with a dominant market share, it has a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monopoly.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">monopoly</a>. This is why horizontal mergers are heavily scrutinized under antitrust laws.\n", "\nCompanies engage in horizontal integration to benefit from <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/synergy.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">synergies</a>. There may be economies of scale or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/costsynergy.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cost synergies</a> in marketing, research and development (R&amp;D), production and distribution. Or there may be economies of scope, which make the simultaneous manufacturing of different products more cost-effective than manufacturing them on their own. Procter &amp; Gamble\u2019s 2005 acquisition of Gillette is a good example of a horizontal merger which realized economies of scope.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff Because both companies produced hundreds of hygiene-related products from razors to toothpaste, the merger reduced the marketing and product development costs per product.\n", "\nSynergies can also be realized by combining products or markets. Horizontal integration is often driven by marketing imperatives. Diversifying product offerings may provide <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cross-sell.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cross-selling</a> opportunities and increase each business\u2019 market. A retail business that sells clothes may decide to also offer accessories, or might merge with a similar business in another country to gain a foothold there and avoid having to build a distribution network from scratch.\n", "\nThe real motive behind a lot of horizontal mergers is that companies want to reduce \u201chorizontal\u201d competition in the form of competition from substitutes, competition from potential new entrants and the competition from established rivals. These are three of the five competitive forces that shape every industry and which are identified in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/porter.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Porter\u2019s Five Forces</a> model. The other two forces, the power of suppliers and customers, drive vertical integration.\n", "\nLike any merger, horizontal integration does not always yield the synergies and added value that was expected. It can even result in negative synergies which reduce the overall value of the business, if the larger firm becomes too unwieldy and inflexible to manage, or if the merged firms experience problems caused by vastly different leadership styles and company cultures. And if a merger threatens competitors, it could attract the attention of the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/ftc.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Federal Trade Commission</a>.\n", "\nExamples of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/051415/what-are-advantages-and-disadvantages-horizontal-integration.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">horizontal integration</a> in recent years include Marriott's 2016 acquisition of Sheraton (hotels) Anheuser-Busch InBev's 2016 acquisition of SABMiller (brewers), AstraZeneca's 2015 acquisition of ZS Pharma (biotech), Volkswagen\u2019s 2012 acquisition of Porsche (automobiles), Facebook's 2012 acquisition of Instagram (social media), Disney's 2006 acquisition of Pixar (entertainment media) and Mittal Steel\u2019s 2006 acquisition of Arcelor (steel).<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"9\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"7\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"6\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"5\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n"]}
