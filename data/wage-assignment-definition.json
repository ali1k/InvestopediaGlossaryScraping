A wage assignment, when involuntary,\u00a0may also be referred to as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/garnishment.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">wage garnishment</a> and requires a court order.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nWage assignments are typically incurred for debts that have gone unpaid for a prolonged period of time.\u00a0Wage assignments can be divided into two categories: voluntary and involuntary. Employees may sometimes opt for a voluntarily wage assignment\u00a0to pay for things like union dues or to contribute to a retirement fund.\n", "\nEmployees may even voluntarily opt into a wage assignment plan as a part of a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/payday-loans.asp\">payday loan</a> repayment promise.\n", "\nWhen a wage assignment is either undertaken\u00a0voluntarily\u00a0or\u00a0mandated by a court and served to an employer, it is\u00a0processed as part of an employer's payroll procedure. The employee has to do nothing, as their paycheck\u00a0is decreased by the amount of the assignment, and noted on their pay stub.\n", "\nIn a voluntary wage assignment, a worker asks their employer to withhold a portion of their paycheck and send it to a creditor to pay off a debt. Loan agreements may sometimes include in their terms a voluntary wage assignment clause should the borrower default on their loan.\n", "\nPayday lenders often include voluntary wage assignments into their loan agreements to better their chances of being repaid. Such a lender may begin a wage assignment without a court order. Laws regarding wage assignments vary by state.\n", "\nFor example, in West Virginia, wage assignments are capped at 25% of a worker's take-home earnings, the employee's signature must be notarized, and agreements must be renewed annually.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff Under Illinois law, a lender cannot resort to wage assignment until a debt is 40 days in default. The wage assignment cannot continue for more than three years, and the worker can stop the wage assignment at any time.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff\n", "\nInvoluntary wage assignments require a court order and are most likely to be employed to collect\u00a0spousal and child support payments that have been ordered by a court. Involuntary wage assignments may also be used to collect unpaid court fines or student loans that have been defaulted on.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nSeveral states allow individuals to sign up for voluntary child support agreements. In such a case, both parents must agree to a plan. Once that happens, a voluntary wage assignment may begin. If a child support or welfare agency is involved, they would have to approve any plan.\n"]}
