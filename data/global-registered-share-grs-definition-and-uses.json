With GRSs, identical shares may trade on different stock exchanges and in various currencies across country borders without needing to be converted into\u00a0local currencies. All holders of GRSs, as with any other\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholder.asp\">shareholder</a>, have equal rights\u2014such as voting,\u00a0percentage of dividends, and so forth\u2014in the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/issuer.asp\">issuing</a> corporation.\n", "\nGlobal registered shares are similar to\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/ordinaryshares.asp\">ordinary shares</a>\u00a0except that investors can trade them on\u00a0stock exchanges around the world in different currencies. For example, if a publicly traded company issues shares in dollars on the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nyse.asp\">New York Stock Exchange</a>\u00a0(NYSE) and issues the same security in pounds on the London Stock Exchange (or vice versa), then it is issuing global shares.\n", "\nGlobal shares are different from the more popular\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/idr.asp\">international depository receipts\u00a0</a>(IDRs).\u00a0IDRS are negotiable certificates issued by a bank that represent ownership of stock in a foreign company held by the bank in <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trust.asp\">trust</a>.\n", "\nIn the United States, IDRs are known as\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/adr.asp\">American depository receipts</a>\u00a0(ADRs).\u00a0The main difference between\u00a0ADRs and global shares is that ADRs are issued only by U.S. banks for foreign stocks that are traded on a U.S. exchange. The underlying security of an ADR is held by an overseas branch of an American financial institution rather than by a global institution.\n", "\nADRs have become known as an efficient way to buy shares in a foreign company and obtain dividends and capital gains in U.S. dollars.\u00a0J.P. Morgan created and launched the first ADR for London\u2019s famed department store\u00a0Selfridges PLC, whose founder, Harry Gordon Selfridge, himself was American. This first-ever ADR was listed on the New York Curb Exchange\u2014precursor to the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/amex.asp\">American Stock Exchange</a>\u00a0(AMEX)\u2014on April 29, 1927.\n", "\nIn Europe, IDRs are known as\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gdr.asp\">global depositary receipts\u00a0</a>(GDRs).\u00a0GDRs are bank certificates that are issued in multiple countries for shares in a foreign company. The shares of a GDR trade as domestic securities that represent a foreign (non-U.S.) interest.\u00a0GDRs may be used by private markets to raise capital that is denominated in either American dollars or\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/euro.asp\">euros</a>.\n", "\nA Global Share\u00a0allows for cross-market portability, while generally costing less than\u00a0other instruments of its type. Because of increasing globalization, securities might trade in multiple markets going forward, which could make the concept of ADRs less valid, but would make GRSs more attractive.\n", "\nAs trading moves toward a round-the-clock timetable, various stock markets and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/clearinghouse.asp\">clearing houses</a> could consolidate, which would make global shares more convenient. Moreover, the regulatory structures of different markets could become more aligned, which would make it less necessary for securities to comply with different local regulations. Finally, a global\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fungibles.asp\">fungible</a>\u00a0security is likely\u00a0best suited to track liquidity around the world.\n", "\nEven with their potential benefits, very few GRSs have been launched since they appeared on the finance scene. Most companies that list securities in the U.S. want access to the broadest range of U.S. investors possible. Some securities experts believe that moving from an ADR to a GRS would do just the opposite\u2014reduce <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp\">liquidity</a>\u00a0instead of enhance it.\n", "\nAnother potential problem is whether the global trading system would be able to handle widespread trading of GRSs because trading is still influenced by regulatory bodies that are national, not international. Before a global share can be launched, operators of the home country's clearing houses must work closely with a U.S. counterpart in order to harmonize their listing requirements with the SEC.\n", "\nNew structures would need to be built one country at a time. Some critics believe that the cost of creating GRS\u00a0programs would be too great, thus offsetting any benefits; and that too much would need to change too fast in order for GRSs to work effectively in the near term.\n", "\nYet\u00a0proponents of global shares say that it is only a matter of time before more businesses replace their ADRs with a single global security, mainly because of how cheap they are to trade. According to the NYSE, trading fees on ADRs tend to cost\u00a0between three and five cents per share traded. In contrast, global shares cost a flat $5.00 per trade. These fees will be subject to change over time.\n", "\nThere is always comfort in the familiar. ADRs have enjoyed a long, lucrative history, and they continue to be U.S.-based investors'\u00a0tool of choice\u00a0for listing\u00a0foreign stock in America. Although no one knows what may come of GRSs as a trading tool\u00a0going forward, the\u00a0comfortable tradition of\u00a0ADRs, combined with the problems of balancing local market regulations with U.S. rules, could well deter finance managers from issuing quantities of global shares any time soon.\n", "\n<strong><em>Reign of the ADR. </em></strong>Foreign issuers have been keen to list securities on the NYSE from its earliest days, and to register them with the\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp\">Securities and Exchange Commission</a>\u00a0(SEC). Listing stock in the U.S.\u00a0makes sense for foreign companies because it offers enhanced scope and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp\">liquidity</a> by increasing the number of potential purchasers of the shares being offered. For foreign companies that already\u00a0have a large number of shareholders, substantial assets, or operations\u00a0in the United States, the need for a U.S. listing is even more pressing.\n", "\n<strong><em>But they don\u2019t make it easy!</em></strong>\u00a0Listing securities in the United States has never been stress-free for non-U.S. companies. To start, foreign companies incur huge initial\u2014and extensive ongoing\u2014costs\u00a0when listing in America. Then, they need to restate their financials\u00a0in accordance with U.S.\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gaap.asp\">Generally Accepted Accounting Principles</a>\u00a0(GAAP); or\u00a0be prepared to discuss and quantify the material differences between the accounting principles of their home country and U.S. GAAP.\u00a0Moreover, these\u00a0issuers\u00a0become subject to continual reporting requirements. They also are faced with certain rules about how they may conduct their business, including limitations in\u00a0dealing\u00a0with the press\u2014even in their home countries!\n", "\nThe German company\u00a0DaimlerChrysler\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/ag-aktiengesellschaft.asp\">Aktiengesellschaft</a>\u00a0(AG)\u00a0is an example of a large foreign corporation that\u00a0does have substantial shareholders, assets, and operations in the United States, as well as American roots. Naturally, DaimlerChrysler would want a large presence in the U.S.\n", "\nThe rub for German companies is that\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearer_share.asp\">bearer shares</a>\u00a0are the prevalent share type\u00a0issued in Germany; but\u00a0bearer shares are not allowed on the NYSE. So, DaimlerCrysler and other German companies have used ADRs to list their securities on the NYSE, which can be a lengthy process.\u00a0\n", "\nAt a certain point in DaimlerChrysler's operations, trading in the U.S. became especially critical for the company, and it\u00a0sought a tool more expeditious than ADRs. Hence, DaimlerChrysler actually <em>created</em> the global\u00a0share!\u00a0In November 1998, DaimlerChrysler became the first non-U.S. corporation to list GRSs on the NYSE.\n", "\nHow did they do it? Although it is\u00a0true that bearer shares are more common in Germany, the German Corporation Act,\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hgb.asp\">Handelsgesetzbuch\u00a0</a>(HGB),\u00a0originally\u00a0authorized that companies could issue\u00a0<em>either\u00a0</em>bearer\u00a0<em>or\u00a0</em>registered shares. Seizing this option, DaimlerChrysler\u00a0created the concept of a \"global share\"\u2014which is\u00a0simply\u00a0a registered share\u2014so that it could trade on the NYSE.\n"]}
