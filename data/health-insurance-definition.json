Health insurance can reimburse the insured for expenses incurred from illness or injury, or pay the care provider directly. It is often included in employer benefit packages as a means of enticing quality employees, with premiums partially covered by the employer but often also deducted from employee paychecks. The cost of health\u00a0insurance premiums\u00a0is deductible to the payer, and the benefits received are tax-free, with certain exceptions for S Corporation Employees.\n", "\nHealth insurance can be tricky to navigate. Managed care insurance plans require policyholders to receive care from a network of designated healthcare providers for the highest level of coverage. If patients seek care outside the network, they must pay a higher percentage of the cost. In some cases, the insurance company may even refuse payment outright for services obtained out of network.\n", "\nMany managed care plans\u2014for example, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hmo.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">health maintenance organizations (HMOs)</a> and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pointofservice-plan-pos.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">point-of-service plans (POS)</a>\u2014 require patients to choose a primary care physician who oversees the patient's care, makes recommendations about treatment, and provides referrals for medical specialists. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/preferred-provider-organization.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Preferred-provider organizations (PPOs)</a>, by contrast, don't require referrals, but do have lower rates for using in-network practitioners and services.\n", "\nInsurance companies may also deny coverage for certain services that were obtained without preauthorization. In addition, insurers may refuse payment for name-brand drugs if a generic version or comparable medication is available at a lower cost. All these rules should be stated in the material provided by the insurance company and should be carefully reviewed. It's worth checking with employers or the company directly before incurring a major expense.\n", "\nIncreasingly, health insurance plans also have <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/copay.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">co-pays</a>, which are set fees that plan subscribers must pay for services such as doctor visits and prescription drugs; <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/health-insurance-deductible-4773113\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">deductibles</a> that must be met before health insurance will cover or pay for a claim; and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coinsurance.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">coinsurance</a>, a percentage of healthcare costs that the insured must pay even after they've met their deductible (and before they reach their <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outofpocket-limit.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">out-of-pocket maximum</a> for a given period).\n", "\nInsurance plans with higher out-of-pocket costs generally have smaller monthly premiums than plans with low deductibles. When shopping for plans, individuals must weigh the benefits of lower monthly costs against the potential risk of large <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outofpocket.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">out-of-pocket expenses</a> in the case of a major illness or accident.\n", "\nOne increasingly popular type of health insurance is a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hdhp.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">high-deductible health plan (HDHP)</a>, which, in 2020, must have IRS-mandated deductibles of at least $1,400 for an individual or $2,800 for a family, and out-of-pocket maximums of $6,900 for an individual/$13,800 for a family. These plans have lower premiums than an equivalent health insurance plan with a lower deductible.

It prohibited insurance companies from denying coverage to patients with pre-existing conditions and allowed children to remain on their parents' insurance plan until they reached the age of 26.

A Supreme Court ruling in 2012 struck down an ACA provision that required states to expand Medicaid eligibility as a condition for receiving federal Medicaid funding, and a number of states chose to refuse expansion.These changes, among others, have led to a drop in the number of people enrolled through the ACA marketplace from a peak of 17.4 million in 2015, to 13.8 million in 2018.\n", "\nTwo public health insurance plans,\u00a0Medicare\u00a0and the\u00a0Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), target older individuals and children, respectively.
