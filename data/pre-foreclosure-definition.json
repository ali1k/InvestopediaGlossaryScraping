In pre-foreclosure, the lender files a\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/notice-of-default.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">notice of default</a>\u00a0on the property because the borrowing owner has exceeded the contractual terms for delinquent payments. A notice of default informs the borrowing owner that the lender is pursuing legal actions toward\u00a0foreclosure.\n", "\nPre-foreclosure can be an important phase because the lender may be open to a last rights negotiation on delinquent debt for the borrower. The borrower often has a final opportunity to potentially reverse the default status by either making up late payments, negotiating a modification, or possibly opting to sell the property before it reaches a final <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreclosure.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">foreclosure</a> eviction.\n", "\nWhen a homebuyer takes out a loan to purchase a property, they sign a contract with the lending institution to repay the mortgage loan according to a contractual agreement, typically with monthly installments. Monthly payments are usually structured to cover a portion of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/principal.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">principal</a> and interest payments on the mortgage.\n", "\nStandard mortgage contracts are often structured to be in default if a borrower fails to make payments for three consecutive months. At that point, the lender is usually contractually authorized to begin pre-foreclosure.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"6\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff\n", "\nThe borrower receives a copy of a notice of default, which is also made a matter of public record, often through a filing with the court. This action begins the pre-foreclosure process, which can take anywhere from weeks to more than a year, as it varies by state and is subject to a court proceeding.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"7\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff A lender is obligated to go through a court proceeding to finalize a foreclosure and eviction notice.\n", "\nThere are several standard steps to a foreclosure proceeding. The notice of default kicks off the proceeding, in the pre-foreclosure phase. In general, the lender needs court approval for their lien on a property, which must be given by a judge.\n", "\nLenders are often more willing to negotiate backdated payments and possible loan modifications in the pre-foreclosure stage of a proceeding in order to avoid paying what can be extensive foreclosure proceeding costs. If foreclosure is granted and a foreclosure <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eviction.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">eviction</a> notice is authorized, the lender can move toward a public auction or trustee sale.\n", "\nA home can be sold during the pre-foreclosure phase, and that can be a win for all of the parties involved. By selling, the homeowner is able to avoid the damage that a foreclosure would have on their credit history. The buyer can usually snag the property for below market value. The lending institution doesn\u2019t have to pay the costs of a foreclosure proceeding, and they don\u2019t have to sell the property themselves.\n", "\nHowever, selling a property independently is not necessarily easy, particularly since there are legalities and disclosure requirements the seller must abide by. Buyers of pre-foreclosed homes will need to be aware of any\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/property-lien.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">property liens</a>\u00a0or unpaid taxes on a home because these could potentially be transferred to the new owner without full disclosure or properly documented clauses.\n", "\nIf the homeowner does not make the past-due (and ongoing) mortgage payments, negotiate a modification, or sell the home during the pre-foreclosure period, the lender will eventually be granted authorization of their lien on the property and then can evict the owner, subsequently taking action to sell the property (typically at auction). The bank owns the property at this point and is more likely to try to sell the property at an even lower price rather than maintain its ongoing expenses, such as taxes and insurance.\n", "\nA pre-foreclosure home that a borrower puts up for sale is typically referred to as a \u201cshort sale.\u201d The sale can be a private transaction between the homeowner and the buyer, but the buyer\u2019s offer must usually be approved by the bank before the sale can be finalized. The purchase price may be less than the outstanding loan balance, which is why the sale is said to be \u201cshort.\u201d<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"9\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\n", "\nKeep in mind, not all short sales are pre-foreclosures.\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/07/avoid_foreclosure.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Homeowners who know they are in trouble</a>\u00a0sometimes elect to sell their properties by any means possible before reaching pre-foreclosure.\n", "\nA buyer can have a pre-foreclosed home inspected before making an offer on it.

In any short sale, the lending bank will likely need to be involved and may hire one or more real estate brokers or attorneys of their own, particularly to prepare a\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/broker_price_opinion.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">broker price opinion</a>.\n", "\nThanks to the\u00a0<a class=\"pseudoStyle\" data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/coronavirus-aid-relief-and-economic-security-cares-act-4800707\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act</a>, signed into law on March 27, 2020,\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/how-to-get-mortgage-relief-4800539\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">an eviction and foreclosure moratorium was put in place</a>\u00a0for government-backed mortgages through Dec. 31, 2020 and then extended through Jan. 31, 2021.

Rates have also fallen to unprecedented lows, making refinancing a viable option for any mortgage borrower who hasn\u2019t previously refinanced within the last few months and is contractually allowed to do so under their current mortgage terms.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"11\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n"]}
