The <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lender.asp\">lender</a> may file a notice of default when a mortgagor falls behind on their mortgage payments. Information on notices of default normally includes the borrower and lender's name and address, the legal address of the property, the nature of the default, as well as other pertinent details. A notice of default is often considered the first step toward foreclosure.\n", "\nA notice of default is a serious action taken by a lender. It notifies a borrower that their delinquent <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/mortgage-rates/payment-structure/\">mortgage payments</a> have breached the limit as outlined in their mortgage loan contract. Lenders outline the number of delinquent payments allowed in a mortgage contract before default action is taken. Most contracts generally allow up to 180 days of missed payments and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/062315/what-are-differences-between-delinquency-and-default.asp\">delinquencies</a> before any action is taken to file a notice of default.\n", "\nA notice of default is typically the final action lenders take before activating the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lien.asp\">lien</a> and seizing the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/collateral.asp\">collateral</a> for foreclosure. A notice of default is usually filed with the state court in which the lien\u00a0is recorded followed by a hearing to activate the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/perfected-lien.asp\">perfected lien</a> recorded with the mortgage closing. Some cases may allow time for the borrower to negotiate by potentially paying delinquent debt or suggesting a settlement.\n", "\nIf the case proceeds to the approval of the perfected property lien, the lender then notifies the borrower that the lien is activated. With an activated lien and a court order for property seizure, the lender can take legal action asking the borrower to vacate the property.\n", "\nAll notices of default contain relevant information pertaining to the borrower, lender, and the property. These details include but aren't limited to:\n", "\nIf a borrower has several delinquent payments, they are at risk of default on a mortgage loan. This also poses the risk of lost collateral. When this happens, the lender may file a notice of default.
