Trading halts are typically enacted in anticipation of a news announcement, to correct an order imbalance, as a result of a technical glitch, or due to regulatory concerns. When a trading halt is in effect, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/openorder.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">open orders</a> may be canceled and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">options</a> still may be exercised.\n", "\nA trading halt is most often instituted in anticipation of an announcement of news that will affect a stock\u2019s price greatly, whether it be positive news or negative news. There are thousands of stocks traded each day on public exchanges such as the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nyse.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)</a> or the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nasdaq.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NASDAQ</a>, and each of these companies agrees to pass on material information to the exchanges prior to announcing it to the general public.\n", "\nIn order to promote the equal dissemination of information, and fair trading based on that information, these exchanges may decide to halt trading temporarily, before such information is released. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/materialnews.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Material developments</a> that warrant a trading halt can include changes that relate to a company\u2019s financial stability, important transactions like restructurings or mergers, public announcements related to a company\u2019s products like a recall, personnel changes to upper management or regulatory or legal announcements that affect the company\u2019s ability to conduct business.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/traderesumption.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Trade resumption</a> refers to the commencement of trading activities after they have been shut down or halted for some period of time.\n", "\nCompanies will often wait until the market closes to release sensitive information to the public, in order to give investors time to evaluate the information and determine whether it is significant. This practice, however, can lead to there being a large imbalance between buy and sell orders in the lead up to the market open. In such an instance, an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exchange.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">exchange</a> may decide to institute a an opening delay, or a trading halt immediately at the market open. These delays are usually in effect for no more than a few minutes, until balance between buy and sell orders can be restored.\n", "\nIf the halt occurs before the official open of trading, it is called held at open. There are three main reasons why a stock is held at the opening: new information is expected to be released by a company that may have considerable impact on its stock price; there is an imbalance in buy and sell orders in the market; a stock does not meet regulatory\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/listingrequirements.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">listing requirements</a>.
