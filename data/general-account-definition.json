These premiums are deposited into the insurer\u2019s general account. The insurer will use these funds in a variety of ways. It will set aside a portion as a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/loss-reserve.asp\">loss reserve</a>, which is used to cover the estimated losses it expects may occur over the course of the year. It will also use these funds to pay for operations, personnel, and other <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/businessexpenses.asp\">business expenses</a>. In order to increase profitability, however, it will also invest some of these premiums in assets of various risk profiles and liquidities.\n", "\nAssets\u00a0held in the general account are \u201cowned\u201d by the general account\u00a0and are not attributed to a specific policy but rather to all policies in aggregate. The insurer may choose, however, to create separate accounts to set aside assets for specific policies or liabilities. Assets in the separate accounts are designed to cover the policy risks associated with the separate account, though if the separate account\u2019s assets are ultimately determined to be insufficient, the insurer may use general account funds to fill\u00a0any gaps.\n", "\nAssets found in the general account may be managed internally, or the management may be provided by a third-party. Increased global competition and changing products with aggressive pricing and guarantees have forced many insurance company executives to reevaluate their traditional investing strategy for general account funds.\u00a0The risk appetite\u00a0for insurance companies tends to be relatively low because they\u00a0have to guarantee that funds are available to cover liabilities.\n", "\nThe general account investment portfolio typically\u00a0contains\u00a0investment-grade bonds and mortgages. Due to volatility, common stock and other equity investments aren't widely included in\u00a0general account portfolios,\u00a0and\u00a0in 2016\u00a0comprised less than 2 percent\u00a0of\u00a0overall investment portfolios\u00a0for insurance carriers.\n"]}
