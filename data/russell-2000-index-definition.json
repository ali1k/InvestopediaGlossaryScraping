The Russell 2000 is widely regarded as a bellwether of the U.S. economy because of its focus on smaller companies that focus on the U.S. market.\n", "\nMany investors compare small-cap\u00a0mutual fund\u00a0performance against the movements of the Russell 2000 index. It is seen as better reflecting opportunities in that entire\u00a0sub-section of the market\u00a0than narrower indices, which may contain biases or more stock-specific risks that can distort performance.\n", "\nThe\u00a0S&amp;P SmallCap 600\u00a0from\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sp.asp\">Standard &amp; Poor's</a> is similar to the Russell 2000 but is not as widely referenced.\n", "\nThe Russell 2000 index, created in 1984 by the Frank Russell Company, is comprised of 2000 small-capitalization companies.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\"></span> It is made up of the bottom two-thirds in company size of the Russell 3000 index. The larger index reflects the movements of nearly 98% of all publicly-traded U.S. stocks.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\"></span><span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\"></span>\n", "\nThe Russell 2000 index is a commonly used benchmark for\u00a0mutual funds\u00a0that identify themselves as \"small-cap,\"\u00a0much like\u00a0the\u00a0S&amp;P 500\u00a0index is used to benchmark large-capitalization stocks.\n", "\nMutual fund\u00a0investors favor\u00a0the Russell 2000 index because it reflects the investment\u00a0opportunity presented by the entire\u00a0market\u00a0rather than opportunities offered by narrower indices, which may contain bias or more stock-specific risk that can distort a\u00a0fund manager\u2019s performance. Many mutual funds and\u00a0ETFs\u00a0are tied to\u00a0or based on\u00a0the Russell 2000.\n", "\nIt is also the most widely quoted measure of the overall performance of small-cap to mid-cap stocks. The index represents approximately 10%\u00a0of the total\u00a0Russell 3000\u00a0market capitalization.\n", "\nAs of\u00a0June 30, 2020, the average value for a company on the Russell 2000 was $2.1 billion; the median market cap was $639 million.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\"></span> The market cap of the largest company in the index was $5.8 billion as of July 2020.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\"></span>\n", "\nThe Russell 2000 first traded above the 1,000 level on May 20, 2013.\u00a0\n", "\nThe Russell 2000 index returns can be replicated by investors who take the trouble to create a sizeable and complex portfolio that mirrors the index. However, there are far easier ways to get the same returns.\n", "\nInvestors can use index futures or index-based mutual funds that track the Russell 2000. The most popular option is an exchange-traded fund. The most heavily traded of the ETFs is the iShares' Russell 2000 index ETF (IWM)\n", "\nUnlike the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the\u00a0Russell 2000 index is\u00a0weighted\u00a0by\u00a0shares outstanding. This means that a member stock\u2019s last\u00a0sale\u00a0price as well as the number of\u00a0shares that can actually be traded (rather than the company\u2019s entire\u00a0market capitalization) influence the index.\n", "\nOther permutations of the Russell 2000 measure the performance of companies with special characteristics. For example, the Russell 2000 Growth Index measures the performance of Russell 2000 companies with higher price-to-book ratios and higher forecasted growth values.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"5\"></span>\n", "\nThe Russell 2000 Value Index measures the performance of Russell 2000 companies with lower price-to-book ratios and lower forecasted growth values.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"6\"></span>\n", "\nThe other big difference between the Russell 2000 and other major indices is that it tracks small-cap stocks. The S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones index, for instance, track large-cap stocks.\n", "\nAs its name entails, the Russell 2000 is an index of 2,000 small-cap companies. First launched in 1984, it is widely used as a benchmark for U.S. small-cap stocks. The index is comprised of the 2,000 smallest companies in the Russell 3000, which itself covers roughly 98% of the stocks publicly traded in the U.S. Each June, the Russell 2000 is rebalanced and new companies are included or deleted from the index.\n", "\nIn May and June each year, the Russell 2000 announces additions and deletions to the small-cap index. Because it is closely followed by mutual funds managers and individual investors, speculation as to which companies will be added can cause a jolt in short-term demand.\n", "\nWithin the Russell 2000, there are a number of subindexes. The Russell 2000 Value Index tracks the performance of companies with lower price-to-book ratios, which shows a company\u2019s market price relative to its balance sheet. The Russell 2000 Growth Index is a subset of companies with higher price-to-book ratios, or those expected to have higher growth values in the future.\n"]}
