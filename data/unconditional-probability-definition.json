Since this probability ignores new information, it remains constant.\n", "\nConditional probability, on the other hand, is the likelihood of an event or outcome occurring, but based on the occurrence of some other event or prior outcome. Conditional probability is calculated by multiplying the\u00a0probability\u00a0of the preceding event by the updated probability of the succeeding, or conditional, event.\n", "\nConditional probability is often portrayed as the \"probability of A given B,\" notated as P(A|B). Unconditional probability also differs from <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jointprobability.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">joint probability</a>, which calculates the likelihood of two or more outcomes occurring simultaneously, and portrayed as the \"probability of A <em>and</em> B\", written as P(A \u2229 B). It essentially incorporates the unconditional probabilities of A and B.\n", "\nAs a hypothetical example from finance, let's examine a group of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">stocks</a> and their returns. A stock can either be a winner, which earns a positive return, or a loser, which has a negative returns. Say that out of five stocks, stocks A and B are winners, while stocks C, D, and E are losers. What, then, is the unconditional probability of choosing a winning stock? Since two outcomes out of a possible five will produce a winner, the unconditional probability is 2 successes divided by 5 total outcomes (2 / 5 = 0.4), or 40%.\n"]}
