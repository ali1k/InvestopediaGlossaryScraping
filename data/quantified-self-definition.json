It can be seen as a type of lifestyle pursued by technology enthusiasts and is associated with early adopters of wearable devices such as those made by Apple Inc. (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=AAPL\">AAPL</a>) and Fitbit Inc.

In this sense, it can be seen as a type of self-improvement philosophy that aims to make use of the latest advances in wearable technology and other fields. To that end, enthusiasts use devices to track metrics such as their heart rate, blood pressure, and sleep hours. Beyond its health applications, quantified self also applies to other areas of life such as using smartphone and desktop applications to track <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/07/budgetingforcompanies.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">budgets</a>, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/investing-4427685\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">investments</a>, and other areas of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/personal-finance-4427760\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">personal finance</a>.\n", "\nSome enthusiasts also use supplemental applications, such as mood trackers or electronic journals, to gather data about their subjective well-being. By combining this information with the objective data gained from wearable devices, the user can potentially uncover valuable correlations and insights regarding their lifestyle and habits. For instance, a user might discover that certain types of food are correlated with noticeably better sleep outcomes.\n", "\nIn some cases, the type of health-related information gathered by many devices can be of substantial medical value. Some doctors\u2019 offices and hospitals are now reviewing the information provided by these devices to better understand a patient\u2019s health condition or responsiveness to prescribed treatments and medications. In the future, developments in the field of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/artificial-intelligence-ai.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">artificial intelligence (AI)</a> could help to make these devices even more useful in diagnosing and predicting health problems.\n", "\nLuke is a technology enthusiast who enjoys using modern applications and devices to learn about his health and habits. He regularly monitors personal metrics such as his income, spending, and mood, as well as health metrics such as his weight, heart rate, and hydration. Over the years, Luke has noticed that he can improve his overall well-being by experimenting with new lifestyle changes and then monitoring the resulting data to see whether they contribute to or detract from his overall health and well-being.\n", "\nIn the past, the technology Luke used for this pursuit was relatively basic, only managing to capture basic metrics and without the ability to easily synchronize or analyze data between devices. In recent years, however, there has been a steady improvement in this area, with this kind of data beginning to be used in the formal health system to help diagnose problems and prescribe solutions. Luke hopes that this trend will continue, particularly as software and wearable devices begin to incorporate increasingly advanced AI.\n"]}
