These third-party services are a relatively new development in the growing field of blockchain technology. The application of blockchain technology has moved well beyond its best-known use in cryptocurrency transactions and has broadened to address secure transactions of all kinds. As a result, there is a demand for hosting services.\n", "\nBaaS is based on the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/software-as-a-service-saas.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">software as a service (SaaS)</a> model and works in a similar fashion. It allows customers to leverage cloud-based solutions to build, host, and operate their own <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">blockchain</a>\u00a0apps and related functions on the blockchain. At the same time, the cloud-based service provider keeps the infrastructure agile and operational.\n", "\nAs a development in the greater blockchain ecosystem, BaaS is seen as boosting blockchain adoption across businesses.\n", "\nMajor players in the BaaS space include:\n", "\nConsumers and businesses are increasingly willing to adapt to\u00a0blockchain technology. However, the technical complexities and operational overhead\u00a0involved in creating, configuring, and operating a blockchain and maintaining its infrastructure often act as a barrier.\n", "\nBaaS offers an external service provider to set up all the necessary blockchain technology and infrastructure for a fee. Once created, the provider continues to handle\u00a0the complex back-end operations for the client.\n", "\nThe BaaS operator typically offers support activities, such as bandwidth management, suitable allocation of resources, hosting requirements, and data security features. The BaaS operator frees the client\u00a0to focus on the core job: the functionality of the blockchain.\n", "\nBelow is a graphic demonstrating the working model of Blockchain-as-a-Service <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hyperledger Cello</a>, a BaaS-like blockchain\u00a0module toolkit and utility system under the Hyperledger project.\n", "\nIn fact, a BaaS\u2019 provider's role is similar to that of a web hosting provider. The website creators create and run all the website content on their own personal computers. They may hire support staff or sign up with an external hosting provider like Amazon Web Services or HostGator. These third-party companies take care of the infrastructure and maintenance issues.\n", "\nBaaS\u00a0may be the catalyst that leads to a wider and deeper penetration of\u00a0blockchain technology across various industry sectors and businesses. Instead of creating and running their own blockchains, a business, large or small, can now simply outsource the technically complex work and focus on its core activities.\n"]}
