A signature loan can typically be used for any purpose the borrower chooses, although the interest rates may be higher than other forms of credit due to the lack of collateral.\n", "\nTo determine whether to grant a signature loan, a lender typically looks for solid <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-history.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">credit history</a> and sufficient income to repay the loan. In some cases, the lender <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/082115/what-are-cosigners-liable-responsible.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">may require a co-signer on the loan</a>, but the co-signer is only called upon in the event the original lender defaults on payments.\n", "\nSignature loans are one type of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unsecuredloan.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">unsecured term loan</a>. Unsecured refers to the fact these loans are not secured by any form of physical collateral, unlike home mortgages and car loans. Term means the loan is <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/amortization.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">amortized</a> over a predetermined time period and paid off in equal monthly installments.\n", "\nApplications for regular credit or revolving credit loans normally trigger a funding delay while the banking institution or loan company examines the borrower\u2019s credit history and checks personal qualifications. <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/041415/pros-cons-personal-loans-vs-credit-cards.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">By contrast, the funds obtained through signature loans</a> are deposited in the borrower\u2019s account more quickly, allowing earlier allocation to financial needs.\n", "\nAs soon as a signature loan is paid off, the account is closed, and the borrower needs to apply for a new loan if they require additional funds. In contrast, a revolving credit account allows the indebted party to repay the loan and maintain the line of credit until the borrower or lender chooses to end the relationship and close the account.\n", "\nWhile the purpose and structure of signature loans have not changed over the years, financial analysts report that the profile of the average borrower accessing signature loans has changed. In the past, borrowers with poor <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit_score.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">credit scores</a> tended to take out signature loans,\u00a0but as interest rates have fallen and loan maximums have increased, many borrowers with good credit and high income have also turned to these loans.\n", "\nThese borrowers use signature loans for a range of purposes, including <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/121216/home-improvement-loans-what-are-your-best-options.asp\">home improvements</a>, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/emergency-loans-for-bad-credit-5075539\">unexpected expenses</a>, medical bills, vacations, and other large expenditures. Some borrowers also use signature loans to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/best-personal-loans-for-debt-consolidation-4779764\">consolidate other debts</a>.\n", "\nLet's say a borrower gets a signature loan with a 7% interest rate for an amount equal to the total of balances that they are carry on credit cards, with rates ranging from 12% to 20%. The borrower then uses the signature loan to pay off the credit cards in full. The borrower will realize distinct savings by repaying the same amount of money at 7% rather than at the former higher rates.\n", "\nIf you're thinking about taking out a signature loan, then a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/personal-loan-calculator-5082130\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">personal loan calculator</a> could be useful\u00a0for figuring out what the monthly payment and total interest should be for the amount you're looking to borrow.\n"]}
