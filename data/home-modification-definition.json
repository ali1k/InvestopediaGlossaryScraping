These alternations are made so that disabled or differently-abled people can live independently and safely.\n", "\nExamples of home modifications include simple measures like removing throw rugs to prevent slips and falls to more permanent fixtures like installing wheelchair-accessible ramps or grab bars in the bathrooms for stability.\n", "\nA home modification can refer to a range of changes, alterations, and repairs that make a home more livable for individuals with different physical abilities. The price of home modifications can be as little as a few hundred dollars, although more extensive renovations can cost many thousands of dollars.\n", "\nFor larger projects, some financing options may be available.

There are structural barriers that can impinge upon an older individual\u2019s independence, and make it so they are unable to go about their daily routines without assistance. Many homes older adults live in single-family homes that were built in a time when physical accessibility was not a consideration.\n", "\nEven now, there are few building requirements concerning physical accessibility in single-family homes.\u00a0The structural incompatibility can make it impossible for an individual to stay in their own home as they grow older, sometimes forcing them to move into a retirement home. If the individual decides to stay in their home, they may need to hire a caretaker, an ongoing expense many people cannot afford.\n", "\nHome modifications range in price and project scope. Some of the most common include larger digital displays for computers, temperature controls, easy-to-use fixtures for light switches or faucets, grab bars or rails, door openers, security systems, wheelchair ramps or stairlifts, and walk-in tubs.\n"]}
