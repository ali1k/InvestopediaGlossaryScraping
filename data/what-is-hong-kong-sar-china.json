Hong Kong is one of China's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/special-administrative-region.asp\">special administrative regions (SARs)</a>. An SAR is a relatively autonomous regions within the People's Republic of China that maintain separate legal, administrative, and judicial systems from the rest of the country.\n", "\nHong Kong is a special administrative region (SAR) that exists as part of the People\u2019s Republic of China under the \u201cOne Country, Two Systems\u201d doctrine, negotiated in the Sino-British Joint Declaration, negotiated and signed in 1984, but taking effect in 1997. The \"One Country, Two Systems\" doctrine stipulated that the People's Republic of China's socialist system would not be practiced in Hong Kong, and Hong Kong would maintain its political and economic quasi-independence\u00a0for 50 years after the transfer of sovereignty, until 2047.\n", "\nWhat does that mean? Since July 1, 1997, when the United Kingdom transferred sovereignty of\u00a0Hong Kong to China, Hong Kong has maintained a separate political and economic system from China\u2014democratic(ish), and capitalist\u2014and\u00a0a separate currency (the<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/forex/h/hkd-hong-kong-dollars.asp\"> Hong Kong Dollar, HKD$</a>).\u00a0Hong Kong retains\u00a0independent executive, legislative and judiciary powers, in all matters other than military defense and foreign affairs. English and Chinese are the two official languages.\n", "\nHong Kong has\u00a0been ranked as the world's freest economy in the Heritage's\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/index-of-economic-freedom.asp\">Index of Economic Freedom</a>\u00a0since the index's inception in 1995. In 1990, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/milton-friedman.asp\">Milton Friedman</a> wrote that it was perhaps the best example of a free market economy. The service economy in Hong Kong is characterized primarily by low taxation, near free port trade, and a well established international financial market. Service economy, here, meaning an economy that is not industrial, or manufacturing based, but is instead based in financial services, health, and human services, hospitality, information technology, etc.\n", "\nAnd using its political and economic autonomy, Hong Kong has positioned itself as the place where international and Chinese businesses find common ground. It is also considered the principal financial center in China.\u00a0As a result, more than 1,300 companies from all over the world are headquartered in Hong Kong.\n", "\nThis democratic government and the free market\u00a0has been\u00a0successful, to some extent. It's the world's 33rd largest economy with a population smaller than the city of Tokyo, at 7.34 million. Hong Kong has an annual GDP of\u00a0$320.9 billion, giving it the world's 17th\u00a0highest\u00a0GDP per capita, at\u00a0$43,681.\n", "\nHistorically, China has had considerable incentive to refrain from interfering in Hong Kong's political and economic systems. At\u00a0the transfer of sovereignty in 1997, Hong Kong, with a population of 6.5 million at the time, had an economy one fifth the size of the Chinese economy, with its population of\u00a01 billion.\n", "\nThis is no longer the case. Over the past 20 years, Hong Kong's economy has stagnated,\u00a0changing\u00a0very little in makeup,\u00a0with\u00a0GDP\u00a0growth slowing, and inequality rising significantly. In that same time, China has become an economic superpower.\u00a0Hong Kong\u00a0now accounts for just\u00a03% of Chinese GDP.\u00a0\n", "\nSome think that the greatest risk to Hong Kong's autonomy\u00a0is political and business elites in the region ceding it\u00a0to the Liaison Office, to remove political tensions from the region, and return Hong Kong to an economic city.\u00a0This may prove a poor decision though, as a marriage of business and government has proven counterproductive in Hong Kong, leading to an increase conflicts of interest and cronyism, not to mention a non-responsive government, that refuses to broaden its tax base, or lower property taxes, and has excluded political parties from democratic participation. All of this has led to a public perception of the\u00a0Hong Kong SAR government as not as\u00a0legitimate as it once was.\n", "\nGiven these recent trends, the Liaison Office, the People's Republic of China representative in Hong Kong, has been taking steps to meaningfully increase its influence and clout in the region, interfering in both domestic affairs and elections. For example, the Liaison Office provides\u00a0loans, bought\u00a0Hong Kong's largest publishing house (removing titles critical of the Communist Party), and lobbied\u00a0for Hong Kong's new chief executive, Carrie Lam.\u00a0\n"]}
