An inheritance may contain cash, investments such as stocks or bonds, and other assets such as jewelry, automobiles, art, antiques, and real estate.\n", "\nThe value of an inheritance can range from a few thousand dollars to several million dollars. In most countries, inheritance assets are subject to <a class=\"CMY_Link CMY_Valid\" data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inheritancetax.asp\">inheritance taxes</a>, where beneficiaries may find themselves saddled with tax liabilities. The rates of an inheritance tax (sometimes referred to as a \"death duty\" or \"the last twist of the taxman's knife) depend on a host of factors, including a beneficiary's state of residence, the value of the inheritance, and the beneficiary's relationship to the\u00a0<a class=\"CMY_Link CMY_Valid\" data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/decedent.asp\">decedent</a>.\n", "\nCurrently, the six American states that have inheritance taxes are Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Nebraska, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. And in most of these states, any assets that are bequeathed to a spouse are exempt from inheritance taxes. In some cases, children are also exempt, or they may face lower rates of taxation.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/07/beneficiary_form.asp\">Beneficiaries</a> with no familial ties to the decedent are typically subject to higher inheritance taxes than beneficiaries who are closely related to the decedent. Consider the following example: in Nebraska in 2018, a parent, grandparent, sibling, child, or other lineal descendants (including adopted children)\u00a0paid\u00a0an inheritance tax of 1% on assets exceeding $40,000. By contrast, relatives who were further removed from the decedent paid\u00a0inheritance taxes of 13% on amounts over $15,000. All other beneficiaries, such as friends and far distant relatives, paid\u00a0inheritance taxes at a rate of 18% on assets exceeding $10,000.\n", "\nThere is a distinction between a \"beneficiary\" and an \"heir\". Beneficiaries refer to individuals named in a will, while heirs refer to people such as a child or a surviving spouse, who are entitled to receive a decedent's property, by \u201cintestate succession\u201d, which is a set of rules created to sort out inheritance matters, in the absence of a will.\n", "\nLisa Marie Presley has recently battled her ex-manager, Barry Siegel over accusations that he squandered her inheritance from her father, Elvis Presley. Her inheritance, according to the lawsuit, was worth $100 million. Siegel also countersued Presley for $800,000.\n"]}
