The annuitant may be the contract holder or another person, such as a surviving spouse. Annuities are generally seen as retirement income supplements. They may be tied to an employee <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pensionplan.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pension plan</a> or a life insurance product. The size of the payments is usually determined by the life expectancy of the annuitant as well as the amount invested.\n", "\nAn annuity is a regular payment of a guaranteed income for life or for some specified number of years. An annuitant may be a retired civil servant who receives a pension plan, or an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investor.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">investor</a> who has paid a sum of money to an insurance company in return for a regular income supplement.\n", "\nDepending on the specifics of the contract, the owner of an annuity may name one or more annuitants, such as a spouse and an elderly parent, or may arrange a joint annuity. The annuitant can also arrange for the payments to be transferred to a surviving spouse if the need arises. In any case, the annuitant must be a person, not a company, or a trust.\n", "\nThe amount of the payments to an annuitant is based on the individual's age and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lifeexpectancy.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">life expectancy</a>, and the age and life expectancy of any beneficiaries. For example, if the annuitant is 65 years old, but the annuity is transferrable to his 60-year-old wife if she survives him, the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/09/choose-insurance-company.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">insurance company</a> will calculate that it will make monthly payments for about 24 years, which is the life expectancy of a 60-year-old woman.\n", "\nIn yet another variation, an annuity can be for a term of \"life-plus\"\u2014that is, the payments will continue for the annuitant's lifetime and then be transferred to a surviving spouse for a specified period of time.\n", "\nThere are many variations of annuity, but they can be boiled down to two basic types:\n", "\nAnnuities are generally taxed as ordinary income. The portion of the annuity payments that represents the contract holder's basis is not taxed, only the gain portion. In the case of an employer pension, the entire payment is generally taxed as ordinary income.\n"]}
