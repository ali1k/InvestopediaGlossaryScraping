It can refer to an option contract giving\u00a0the owner the right, but not the obligation, to buy a specified amount of an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underlying-security.asp\">underlying security</a> at a specified price within a specified time.\u00a0It can also refer to a call auction, a time when buyers set a maximum acceptable price to buy, and sellers set the minimum satisfactory price to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bullverticalspread.asp\">sell</a> a security on an exchange.

The call auction is a type of trading method on a securities exchange in which prices are determined by trading during a specified time and period. A\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">call option</a> is a derivative product\u00a0which is traded on a formal exchange or in\u00a0the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otc.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">over-the-counter</a>\u00a0marketplace.

Auctions are most common on smaller exchanges\u00a0with the offering of a limited number of\u00a0stocks. All securities\u00a0can be called for trade simultaneously, or they could trade\u00a0sequentially.\u00a0Buyers of\u00a0a stock\u00a0will stipulate their maximum acceptable price and sellers will designate\u00a0their minimum acceptable price.\u00a0All interested\u00a0traders\u00a0must be present at the same time.\u00a0At the termination of the auction call period, the security is\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/illiquid.asp\">illiquid</a>\u00a0until its\u00a0next call.\u00a0Governments will sometimes employ call auctions when they sell <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurynote.asp\">treasury notes</a>, bills, and bonds.\n", "\nIt is important to remember that orders in a call auction are priced orders, meaning that participants specify the price they are willing to pay beforehand. The participants in an auction cannot limit the extent of their losses or gains because their orders are satisfied at the price arrived at during the auction.\n", "\nSuppose a trader buys a call option with a premium of $2 for Apple's shares at a strike price of $100. The option is set to expire a month later. The call option gives her the right, but not the obligation, to purchase the Cupertino company's shares, which are trading at $120 when the option was written, for $100 a month later. The option will expire worthless if Apple's shares are changing hands for less than $100 a month later. But a price point above $100 will give the option buyer a chance to buy shares of the company for a price cheaper than the market price.\n", "\nSuppose a stock ABC's price is to be determined using a call auction. There are three buyers for the stock - X, Y and Z. X has placed an order to buy 10,000 ABC shares for $10 while Y and Z have placed orders for 5,000 shares and 2,500 shares at $8 and $12 respectively. Since X has the maximum number of orders, she will win the bid and the stock will be sold for $10 at the exchange. Y and Z will also pay the same price as X. A similar process can be used to determine the selling price of a stock.\n", "\nExamples of strategies using calls and puts include the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/seagull-option.asp\">seagull option</a>.\n"]}
