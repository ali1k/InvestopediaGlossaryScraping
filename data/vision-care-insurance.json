The plan may cover the cost of these items in full, up to a preset limit, or it may require the policyholder to pay a flat fee or percentage fee to share the expense with the insurer.\n", "\nVision care insurance tends to be inexpensive compared to other types of insurance because many of the covered costs are predictable and expensive claims are rare. In fact, it more closely resembles a discount plan than a true insurance plan because insurance is meant to protect against unforeseen and potentially catastrophic expenses.\n", "\nIt's important\u00a0you\u00a0fully understand what each plan costs and the benefits they come with when you buy vision care insurance. Take a look at the cost for one year of vision insurance compared with the cost of an eye exam.\u00a0Although vision care insurance is inexpensive, it may not be a good deal for the consumer, if the costs of premiums and co-payments under the plan are higher compared to the costs of paying for vision care expenses out of pocket.\n", "\nEye diseases, which are unpredictable and can be expensive to treat, will generally be covered by health insurance, not by vision care insurance.\u00a0Vision care coverage through many <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/employer_sponsored_plan.asp\">employer-sponsored health plans</a> generally works a little differently than other health insurance or major medical insurance plans.\n", "\nBecause eye exams can detect hidden medical problems, even those with perfect vision should get one from time to time. As someone\u00a0ages, they\u2019ll need more frequent vision exams, according\u00a0to the Mayo Clinic.\u00a0People with poor vision, a family history of eye disease, or a condition that increases the\u00a0risk of eye disease like diabetes should have more frequent exams.\u00a0If routine exams are all that is needed, the cost of insurance probably isn't\u00a0worth it.\n", "\nVision care insurance can often be obtained through your employer, association union, or through a government program such as\u00a0Medicare or Medicaid. Most vision insurance providers also offer policies that you can purchase individually.\n", "\nVision insurance often is a value-added benefit linked to indemnity health insurance, health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/preferred-provider-organization.asp\">preferred provider organizations (PPOs)</a> that have contracted with managed vision care networks to provide eye care services.\n"]}
