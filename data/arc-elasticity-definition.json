Arc elasticity measures elasticity at the midpoint between two selected points on the demand curve by using a midpoint between the two points. The arc elasticity of demand can be calculated as:\n", "\nLet\u2019s calculate the arc elasticity following the example presented above:\n", "\nWhen you use arc elasticities you do not need to worry about which point is the starting point and which point is the ending point since the arc elasticity gives the same value for elasticity whether prices rise or fall. Therefore, the arc elasticity is more useful than the price elasticity when there is a considerable change in price.\n"]}
