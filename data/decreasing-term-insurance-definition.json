Premiums are usually constant throughout the contract, and reductions in coverage typically occur monthly or annually. Terms range between 1 year and 30 years but it depends on the insurance company and the plan they offer.\n", "\nThe theory behind decreasing term insurance holds that\u00a0with age, certain liabilities, and the corresponding need for high levels of insurance decreases. Numerous in-force decreasing term insurance policies take the form of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/insurance/mortgage-life-insurance/\">mortgage life insurance</a>, which affixes its benefit to the remaining mortgage of an insured\u2019s home.\n", "\nAlone, decreasing term insurance may not be sufficient for an individual's life insurance needs, especially if they have a family with dependents. Affordable standard term life insurance policies offer the security of a death benefit throughout the life of the contract.\n", "\nDecreasing term insurance is a more affordable option than <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wholelife.asp\">whole life</a> or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/universallife.asp\">universal life insurance</a>. The death benefit is designed to mirror the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/amortization_schedule.asp\">amortization schedule</a> of a mortgage or other personal debt not easily covered by personal assets or income, like personal loans or business loans.\n", "\nDecreasing term insurance allows a pure death benefit with no cash accumulation, unlike, for example, a whole life insurance policy. As such, this insurance option has modest premiums for comparable benefit amounts to either a permanent or temporary life insurance.\n", "\nFor example, a 30-year-old male who is a non-smoker might pay a premium of $25 per month\u00a0throughout the life of a 15-year $200,000 decreasing term policy, customized to parallel a mortgage amortization schedule. The monthly cost for the level-premium\u00a0decreasing term plan does not change. As the insured ages, the risk of the carrier increases. This increase in risk warrants\u00a0the declining death benefit.\u00a0\n", "\nA permanent policy with the same face amount $200,000 could require monthly premium payments of $100 or more per month. While some universal or whole life policies allow reductions of face amounts when the insured uses the policy for loans or other advances, the policies frequently hold fixed death benefits.\n", "\nThe predominant use of decreasing term insurance is most often for\u00a0personal asset protection. Small business partnerships also use a decreasing term life policy to protect indebtedness against startup costs and operational expenses.\n", "\nIn the case of small businesses,\u00a0if one partner dies, the death benefit proceeds from the decreasing term policy can help to fund continuing operations or retire the percentage of the remaining debt for which the deceased partner is responsible. The security allows\u00a0the business to guarantee commercial loan amounts affordably.\n"]}
