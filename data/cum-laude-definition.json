Educational institutions use the phrase to signify an academic degree that was awarded with honor.\n", "\nCum laude is one of three commonly used types of Latin honors recognized in the United States, the other two being <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/summa-cum-laude.asp\">summa cum laude</a> and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/magna-cum-laude.asp\">magna cum laude</a>. The terms come from Latin, so they often are called Latin honors. They are\u00a0common in the United States, but very few countries around the world use them.\n", "\nWhile cum laude signifies a distinguished level of academic achievement, an even higher distinction is magna cum laude, which means \"with high honor\" or \"with high praise.\" Summa cum laude bestows the highest honor or praise on its recipient.\u00a0\n", "\nThe guidelines by which each level of academic honor is achieved differ at academic institutions. Each university or college typically outlines its own expectations for each honor.\n", "\nThe criteria for earning Latin honors may include grade-point average (<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/020315/applying-grad-school-gpa-vs-work-experience.asp\">GPA</a>), class ranking, the number of credit hours completed, and other academic achievements.\n", "\nStudents receiving Latin honors are typically recognized during graduation ceremonies, and the designation appears on the student's diploma. Students graduating with honors also may be allowed to wear some sort of special insignia at graduation.\n", "\nSome universities bestow\u00a0Latin honors at certain GPA levels. Typically, a GPA of 3.5 or higher is required to receive the cum laude designation, with higher GPAs required for magna cum laude and summa cum laude. The designation is based only an individual student's final GPA.\n", "\nOther universities reserve Latin honors for a stated percentage of each graduating class. That means only a top percentage of a class may receive any honors and smaller percentages may receive\u00a0the magna cum laude and summa cum laude honors designations. At Ivy League universities and other highly competitive schools, GPA alone may not be enough to earn these honors. Faculty committees also consider students' academic records and achievements and may recommend honors for exceptional students.\n", "\nCum laude refers to a high level of academic achievement. In Latin, it means \u201cwith honor\u201d or \u201cwith praise\u201d. Cum laude is one of three Latin terms of academic excellence used in the United States, following summa cum laude and magna cum laude. While there is no universal benchmark that determines cum laude, often it occurs above a final GPA of 3.5.\n", "\nWhile cum laude represents a distinguished level of achievement, magna cum laude is one level above. Meaning \u201cwith great praise\u201d in Latin, magna cum laude differs from summa cum laude, which in turn means \u201chighest praise\u201d or \u201chighest honor\u201d representing the highest level of academic distinction. These designations may be awarded on different factors such as GPA, class ranking, or outside academic achievements.\u00a0\n", "\nConsider the University of Pennsylvania, where students must have a GPA of 3.4 to graduate cum laude. By contrast, New York University awards students cum laude if students fall within the top 30% of the graduating class. Ultimately, these designations can vary widely across academic institutions, and are evaluated across differing metrics.\n"]}
