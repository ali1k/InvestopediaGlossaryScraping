The difference between the actual sales price and the market value of the home is the actual gift of equity. Most lenders allow the equity to be used toward a down payment.\n", "\nGift of equity derives its name from the fact that the sales price is so much lower than the real market price of the home. The transfer counts as a gift due to the difference in value, but no physical money changes hands. A common gift of equity occurs when parents wish to sell their home to a child for a favorable price.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nMost lenders allow the gift to count as, or towards, a down payment on the home. The residence may be either a primary residence or a second home.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nFamilies or interested parties can use a gift of equity instead of going through a real estate company that would charge a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commission.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">commission</a> on the sale. The parents would name a price that they agreed on and \u201csell\u201d the house to their children for that amount, even though the house could be worth more on the open market.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nGifts of equity do not avoid <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/closingcosts.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">closing costs</a> or other necessary expenses when transferring the title of the property. A gift of equity could also trigger a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gifttax.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">gift tax</a>.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nThe gift will impact the property's cost basis causing <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalgain.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">capital gains</a> to be higher when the recipient sells the home in the future. A gift of equity will also affect the local real estate market by recording a sale of a property at below market value.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nA gift of equity requires a gift of equity letter, which is a letter stating the facts of the sale and is signed by both the seller and the buyer. Along with the letter, other considerations must be met:<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nAt <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/closing.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">closing</a>, a second letter will note the gift of equity.\n", "\nA gift of equity can have tax consequences for both the giver and the receiver of the gift. The home's value can impact the asset's <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/costbasis.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cost basis</a> for the new homeowner and have capital gains implications for the seller. Also, if not executed properly, a gift of equity could trigger a gift tax. The sellers must follow IRS guidelines for gifts. A couple can gift up to $30,000 and a person $15,000 to an individual per year without being subject to a gift tax.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nAdditionally, a considerable sale can affect the local real estate market. If a house sells for considerably less than others with comparable features, it may negatively impact other home sales in that price point or area. However, it may be possible for the transaction to be done privately or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pocket-listing.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">off-market</a> to avoid that complication.\n", "\nA lender can consider the gift of equity as all or part of the cash payment required to qualify for a mortgage. For example, say a bank requires 20% down (the standard amount needed in most <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/conventionalmortgage.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">conventional loans</a>, to avoid mortgage insurance). The gift of equity the seller makes equals 10% of the home's value. The buyer now only needs to make a down payment of 10% of the property's price tag.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"5\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nIn the case of a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fhaloan.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Federal Housing Administration (FHA)</a> loan, a gift of equity is allowed from a family member to cover a minimum 3.5% down payment, as long as the home is their primary residence. <span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n"]}
