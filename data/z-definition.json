This extension is just one of the fifth-letter identifiers that appear after a company's ticker symbol. It indicates that the stock is different from single issues of common or capital stock. The reasons for a Z-designation tend to vary and may include things like <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/depositaryreceipt.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">depositary receipts</a> or units. The reasons for a Z designation aren't always obvious and usually require a little research.\n", "\nCompanies must choose a unique <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tickersymbol.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ticker symbol</a> when they want to list on a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/04/092404.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">stock exchange</a>. This symbol is made up of a series of characters that identifies the company's stock. It allows traders to execute <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/transaction.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">transactions</a> for these securities. The ticker symbol also identifies the stock exchange on which a particular security trades. For instance, a ticker with three letters trades on the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"4\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nyse.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">New York Stock Exchange</a> (NYSE), while those with four letters trade on the Nasdaq.\n", "\nThese ticker symbols may come with suffixes that alert <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholder.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">shareholders</a> to specific situations about the stock itself. Suffixes for Nasdaq-listed securities appear as fifth-letter identifiers and follow a dot after their ticker symbols.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff When a fifth letter appears, it identifies the issue as different from a single issue of common stock or capital stock.\n", "\nThe Z-letter suffix identifies a variety of miscellaneous entities.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff Unlike other designations, this one can be fairly vague, so it's up to individuals investors and traders to do their <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duediligence.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">due diligence</a>. Doing a little research can help them figure out why the suffix is added to the end of the security's ticker symbol.\n", "\nAs mentioned above, the letter Z identifies securities that are not single issues of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commonstock.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">common</a> or <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalstock.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">capital stock</a>. It may indicate that the security is a depositary receipt, stub, additional warrant, or another type of unit. Z historically had a different meaning in futures <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futures.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">trading</a>, though, where it indicated a delivery month of December until new options symbology was introduced in 2010.\n", "\nThe Nasdaq uses a variety of letters or fifth-letter designations to distinguish stock issuances and the rights that come along with them. Z is just one of those designations. Like Z, the letter L also identifies miscellaneous entities.
