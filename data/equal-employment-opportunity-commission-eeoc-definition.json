The EEOC was formed by Congress to enforce Title VII of the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/civil-rights-act-1964.asp\">Civil Rights Act of 1964</a>, opening its door for business on July 2, 1965.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"19\"></span> It is headquartered in Washington, D.C., and in 2021 maintains 37 other field offices throughout the United States in 15 districts.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"17\"></span>\n", "\nThe EEOC enforces <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/120914/8-federal-laws-protect-employees.asp\">federal laws that make it illegal to discriminate</a> because of a person\u2019s race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy, transgender status, and sexual orientation), national origin, age (40 or older), disability, or genetic information.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\"></span> In addition, it is against the law to discriminate against a person who complains about discrimination, has filed a charge of discrimination, or has participated in an employment discrimination investigation or lawsuit.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"20\"></span> (In fact, 55.8% of charges filed with the EEOC in 2020 were for retaliation.)<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"16\"></span> Indeed, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/022615/how-have-business-ethics-evolved-over-time.asp\">business ethics have changed considerably</a> since the turbulent 1960s first roiled their relatively placid waters.\n", "\nThe EEOC is vested with the authority to investigate any charges of discrimination brought against employers, who are generally subject to EEOC laws if they have at least 15 employees (in the case of age discrimination that rises to 20). Many labor unions and employment agencies fall under its jurisdiction as well.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\"></span>\n", "\nThe EEOC\u2019s role is to fairly and accurately assess allegations in the charge and then make a finding. If it finds discrimination has occurred, it will try to settle the charge. It also has the authority to file a lawsuit to protect individuals and the interests of the public.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\"></span>\n", "\nThe laws enforced by the EEOC apply to all types of work situations, processes, and functions. This includes the hiring and termination\u00a0of employees, harassment among the staff or management, job training, promotions, wages, and benefits. Another role of the EEOC is to seek to prevent discrimination before it can occur.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\"></span>\n", "\nThe EEOC works on preventing workplace discrimination through outreach and a variety of education and technical assistance programs.\n", "\nIf you believe you\u2019ve been discriminated against at work because of your race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy, gender identity, and sexual orientation), national origin, age (40 or older), disability, or genetic information, you can file a charge of discrimination with the EEOC. This is a signed statement describing how an employer, union, or labor organization engaged in employment discrimination that asks the EEOC to take remedial action. All of the laws enforced by the EEOC, except for the Equal Pay Act, require you to file a charge of discrimination before you can file a job discrimination lawsuit against your employer.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"11\"></span>\n", "\nThere are time limits of either 180 or 300 calendar days, depending on certain circumstances.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"12\"></span> You can file a charge through the EEOC Public Portal after you submit an online inquiry and have an intake interview with an EEOC staff member.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"13\"></span>\n", "\nThe EEOC may specifically investigate not only employers for violations but also members of their staff accused of engaging in harassment or discrimination.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"22\"></span> For example, if a manager refuses to interview or hire qualified job candidates solely because of their ethnicity or race, then the employer can be held accountable for allowing racist behavior to persist. This can also be applied to employers who permit harassment to continue unchecked. And although the EEOC itself says that <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/independent-contractor.asp\">independent contractors</a> are not subject to anti- discrimination laws, in 2009 the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, in Halpert v. Manhattan Apartments, ruled that companies can be held liable for independent contractors who act on their behalf.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"22\"></span><span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"23\"></span>\n", "\nThe EEOC has filed lawsuits against companies where corrective action was not taken after derogatory slurs, threats, assaults, unwanted sexual comments, or inappropriate touching occurred in the workplace. Companies can also be penalized for not warning employees about past misconduct committed by another employee or manager with whom they are directed to work.\n", "\nEEOC lawsuits might seek monetary damages, including <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/punitive-damages.asp\">punitive</a> and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/compensatory-damages.asp\">compensatory</a> damages and injunctive relief. In fiscal year 2020, the EEOC received 67,448 charges of workplace discrimination, with 38% of claims being allegations of discrimination based on race or color.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"15\"></span> Charges for sex-based harassment, which includes charges for sexual harassment, clocked in at 11,497, down by nearly 1,300 from 2019.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"14\"></span>\n", "\nThe EEOC is open to attempts to settle cases before the issue is investigated and possibly taken to trial. It offers a mediation procedure, an informal process in which two parties can work with a neutral mediator to see if they can reach a reconciliation of their differences. The mediator doesn\u2019t ultimately make a determination, however, serving only to help the two parties reach a settlement on their own. If mediation fails, then the EEOC proceeds to formally investigate the complaint.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\"></span>\n"]}
