The number of units is determined by the lot size. For example, in the stock market, a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/roundlot.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">round lot</a> is 100 shares. However, investors do not have to buy round lots, where a lot can be any number of shares.\n", "\nWhen investors and traders purchase and sell financial instruments in the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalmarkets.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">capital markets</a>, they do so with lots. A lot is a fixed quantity of units and depends on the financial security traded.\n", "\nFor stocks, the typical lot size was round lots of 100 shares for many years, until the advent of online trading. A round lot can also refer to a number of shares that can evenly be divided by 100, such as 300, 1,200, and 15,500 shares.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"3\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nHowever, now <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/oddlot.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">odd lots</a>, which is an order for less than 100 shares, and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mixedlot.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mixed lots</a>\u2014a number of shares above 100 but not divisible by 100\u2014are more common. Similar to stocks, the round lot for exchange-traded securities, such as an <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">exchange-traded fund</a> (ETF), is 100 shares.\n", "\nThe <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bondmarket.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bond market</a> is dominated by institutional investors who buy debt from bond issuers in large sums. A round lot for U.S. government and corporate bonds in some circles is considered $1 million. However, it can also be $100,000, such as the case with <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/municipalbond.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">municipal bonds</a>.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"2\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nThat doesn't mean a trader or investor needs to buy bonds in that quantity. Bonds typically have a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/facevalue.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">face value</a> of $1,000 to $10,000 (some are even lower). An investor can buy as many bonds as they like, yet it still may be an odd lot.\n", "\nIn terms of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">options</a>, a lot represents the number of contracts contained in one derivative security. One equity option contract represents 100 <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underlying-asset.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">underlying shares</a> of a company\u2019s stock. In other words, the lot for one <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/optionscontract.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">options contract</a> is 100 shares.\n", "\nFor example, an options trader purchased one Bank of America (BAC) <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">call option</a> last month. The option has a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strikeprice.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">strike price</a> of $24.50 and expires this month. If the options-holder <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exercise.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">exercises</a> their call option today when the underlying stock, BAC, is trading at $26.15, they can purchase 100 shares of BAC at the strike price of $24.50. One option contract gives them the right to purchase the lot of 100 shares at the agreed strike price.\n", "\nWith such <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standardization.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">standardization</a>, investors always know exactly how many units they are buying with each contract and can easily assess what price per unit they are paying. Without such standardization, valuing and trading options would be needlessly cumbersome and time-consuming.\n", "\nTypically, the smallest options trade an investor can make is for one contract, and that represents 100 shares. However, it is possible to trade options for a smaller amount with mini-stock options which have an underlying share amount of 10.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"6\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nWhen it comes to the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futuresmarket.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">futures market</a>, lots are known as <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/contractsize.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">contract sizes</a>. The underlying asset of one futures contract could be an equity, a bond, interest rates, commodity, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketindex.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">index</a>, currency, etc. Therefore, the contract size varies depending on the type of contract that is traded.\n", "\nFor example, one futures contract for corn, soybeans, wheat, or oats has a lot size of 5,000 bushels of the commodity.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"4\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff The lot unit for one Canadian dollar futures contract is 100,000 CAD, one British pound contract is 62,500 GBP, one Japanese yen contract is 12,500,000 JPY, and one euro futures contract is 125,000 EUR.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"5\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nUnlike stocks, bonds, and ETFs in which odd lots can be purchased, the standard contract sizes for options and futures are fixed and non-negotiable. However, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/derivative.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">derivatives</a> traders purchasing and selling <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forwardcontract.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">forward contracts</a> can customize the contract or lot size of these contracts, since forwards are non-standardized contracts that are created by the parties involved.\n", "\nStandardized lots are set by the exchange and allow for greater liquidity in the financial markets. With increased liquidity comes reduced <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spread.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">spreads</a>, creating an efficient process for all participants involved.\n", "\nWhen trading currencies, there are micro, mini, and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standard-lot.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">standard lots</a>. A micro lot is 1,000 of the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/basecurrency.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">base currency</a>, a mini lot is 10,000, and a standard lot is 100,000.

For example, they could trade 1,451,000. That is 14 standard lots, five mini lots, and one micro lot. In a stock trade, a person can trade in odd lots of less than 100 shares.\n"]}
