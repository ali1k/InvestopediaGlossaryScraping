The First World was used to describe countries whose views aligned with NATO and\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalism.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">capitalism</a>, the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/second-world.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Second World</a>\u00a0referred to countries that\u00a0supported\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/communism.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">communism</a>\u00a0and the Soviet Union and the Third World referenced the nations that were not actively aligned with either side.\u00a0These countries included impoverished former European colonies and all the nations of Africa, the Middle East, Latin America, and Asia.\n", "\nThe term Fourth World was born later as an extension of the developing Third World to describe places and populations characterized by extremely low <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/income-per-capita.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">income per capita</a> and limited natural resources.\n", "\nFourth World nations consisted of those excluded from mainstream society.

These tribes can function free from any assistance from others but, from a global standpoint, were considered to be Fourth World nations. Fourth World nations do not contribute or consume anything on the global scale and are unaffected by any global events.\n", "\nPolitical borders did not define Fourth World areas. In many cases, they were defined as\u00a0nations\u00a0without sovereign status,\u00a0emphasizing\u00a0instead the perceived non-recognition and exclusion of ethnically\u00a0and religiously\u00a0defined peoples from the politico-economic world system, such as the\u00a0First Nations\u00a0groups throughout North, Central, and South America.\n", "\nThe term Fourth World was believed to have been first used in Canada by\u00a0Mbuto Milando, the first secretary of the\u00a0Tanzanian\u00a0High Commission, in a conversation with\u00a0George Manuel, Chief of the National Indian Brotherhood (now the\u00a0Assembly of First Nations).
