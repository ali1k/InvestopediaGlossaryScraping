In economics, it is sometimes used in reference to <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/centralbank.asp\">central banks</a>.\n", "\nAnyone can, in principle, use moral suasion to try to convince another party to change their attitude or behavior, but in an economic context it generally refers to central bankers'\u00a0use of persuasive tactics in public or private. It is often simply called \"suasion\" and the motives behind it are not always altruistic, but have more to do with the pursuit of particular policies.\n", "\nIn the U.S., moral suasion is also known as \"jawboning,\" since it amounts to talk, in contrast to more forceful methods the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalreservesystem.asp\">Federal Reserve</a> (Fed) and other policymakers\u00a0have at their disposal. More specifically, attempts by central banks to influence the rate of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp\">inflation</a> without resorting to open market operations are sometimes called \"open mouth operations.\"\n", "\nMoral suasion can be employed in public as well as behind closed doors. Fed chair <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/alangreenspan.asp\">Alan Greenspan's</a> criticism of the prevailing economic mood as \"<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irrationalexuberance.asp\">irrational exuberance</a>\" in 1996 is remembered as a classic example of the Fed's use of suasion, but when asset prices did collapse in 2000, critics attacked Greenspan for having done too little\u2014be it with interest rates, margin lending requirements or jawboning\u2014to check the 1990s' exuberance.\n", "\nIn recent years the Fed has made a concerted effort to engage more with the public, which could be seen as an effort to increase transparency\u2014or to leverage its power of moral suasion. Greenspan advocated a policy of\u00a0\"constructive ambiguity\"\u2014arguably the opposite of moral suasion\u2014famously telling a senator,\u00a0\"if you understood what I said, I must have misspoke.\" <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/benbernanke.asp\">Ben Bernanke</a> broke with that approach and made an effort to communicate Fed policy more clearly; he introduced press conferences in 2011 at the suggestion of his eventual successor, <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/101613/janet-yellen-background-and-philosophy.asp\">Janet Yellen</a>.\n", "\nIncreased jawboning may have been seen as necessary, given the decreased ability of the Fed to cut <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp\">interest rates</a>\u2014which were near zero from December 2008 to December 2015\u2014or increase the size of its <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancesheet.asp\">balance sheet</a> much further. With traditional monetary policy tools more difficult to employ, the Fed has attempted to convince markets of its willingness to support a sustained economic recovery through words rather than deeds, when possible.\n", "\nA famous example of the use of moral suasion is the New York Federal Reserve's intervention in the bailout of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/longtermcapital.asp\">Long-Term Capital Management</a> (LTCM) in 1998.\n", "\nLTCM\u00a0was a highly successful hedge fund, generating a string of high-double-digit annual returns in the 1990s. It was highly <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leverage.asp\">leveraged</a>, however, with around $30 of debt per dollar of capital at the end of 1997. The <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asian-financial-crisis.asp\">Asian financial crisis</a> sent it into a tailspin, leading to worries that a fire sale of its assets would drive down prices and leave its creditors\u2014the bulk of Wall Street's major banks\u2014with massive unpaid loans on their books.\n", "\nRather than directly injecting public money, the New York Fed called a meeting in its offices of three banks that had lent to\u00a0LTCM. These banks decided to cooperate on a rescue, which the Fed helped coordinate but did not fund. Eventually, a consortium of 14 banks bailed LTCM\u00a0out for $3.6 billion. The fund was liquidated two years later and the banks earned a slight profit.\n", "\nThe New York Fed was criticized for creating the impression that LTCM\u00a0was <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/too-big-to-fail.asp\">\"too big to fail,\"</a> but the decision to pressure banks into providing bailout funds was seen\u00a0as an alternative to more heavy-handed\u2014and potentially harmful\u2014tactics.\n"]}
