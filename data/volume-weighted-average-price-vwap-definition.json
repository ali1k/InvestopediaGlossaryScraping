To calculate the VWAP yourself, follow these steps. Assume a 5-minute chart; the calculation is same regardless of what intraday time frame is used.\n", "\nLarge institutional buyers and <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutualfund.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mutual funds</a> use the VWAP ratio to help move into or out of stocks with as small of a market impact as possible. Therefore, when possible, institutions will try to buy below the VWAP, or sell above it. This way their actions push the price back toward the average, instead of away from it.\n", "\nTraders may use VWAP as a trend confirmation tool, and build trading rules around it. For example, when the price is above VWAP they may prefer to initiate long positions. When the price is below VWAP they may prefer to initiate <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/short.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">short positions</a>.\n", "\nOn a chart, VWAP and a moving average may look similar.

Attempting to create an average VWAP over many days could mean that the average becomes distorted from the true VWAP reading as described above.\n", "\nWhile some institutions may prefer to buy when the price of a security is below the VWAP, or sell when it is above, VWAP is not the only factor to consider. In strong uptrends, the price may continue to move higher for many days without dropping below the VWAP at all or only occasionally. Therefore, waiting for the price to fall below VWAP could mean a missed opportunity if prices are rising quickly.\n", "\nVWAP is based on historical values and does not inherently have predictive qualities or calculations. Because VWAP is anchored to the opening price range of the day, the indicator increases its lag as the day goes on. This can be seen in the way a 1-minute period VWAP calculation after 330 minutes (the length of a typical trading session) will often resemble a 390-minute moving average at the end of the trading day.\n", "\nThe Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) is a measurement that shows the average price of a security, adjusted for its volume. It is calculated by taking the total dollar value of trading in the security and dividing it by the volume of trades during that period. Specifically, the formula for calculating VWAP is as follows:\n", "\n\ufeff<span data-value=\"\\text{VWAP}=\\frac{\\sum\\text{Price * Volume}}{\\sum\\text{Volume}}\">\ufeff<span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\">\n<math>\n<semantics>\n<mrow>\n<mtext>\nVWAP\n</mtext>\n<mo>\n=\n</mo>\n<mfrac>\n<mrow>\n<mo>\n\u2211\n</mo>\n<mtext>\nPrice\u00a0*\u00a0Volume\n</mtext>\n</mrow>\n<mrow>\n<mo>\n\u2211\n</mo>\n<mtext>\nVolume\n</mtext>\n</mrow>\n</mfrac>\n</mrow>\n<annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\n\\text{VWAP}=\\frac{\\sum\\text{Price * Volume}}{\\sum\\text{Volume}}\n</annotation>\n</semantics>\n</math></span><span class=\"katex-html\"><span class=\"strut\"></span><span class=\"strut bottom\"></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"mord text\"><span class=\"mord mathrm\">VWAP</span></span><span class=\"mrel\">=</span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mopen nulldelimiter\"></span><span class=\"mfrac\"><span class=\"vlist-t vlist-t2\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\"><span class=\"\"><span class=\"pstrut\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\"><span class=\"mop op-symbol small-op mtight\">\u2211</span><span class=\"mord text mtight\"><span class=\"mord mathrm mtight\">Volume</span></span></span></span></span><span class=\"\"><span class=\"pstrut\"></span><span class=\"frac-line\"></span></span><span class=\"\"><span class=\"pstrut\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\"><span class=\"mop op-symbol small-op mtight\">\u2211</span><span class=\"mord text mtight\"><span class=\"mord mathrm mtight\">Price\u00a0*\u00a0Volume</span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=\"vlist-s\">\u200b</span></span><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\"></span></span></span></span><span class=\"mclose nulldelimiter\"></span></span></span></span></span></span>\ufeff\ufeff\n", "\nThe VWAP is used by traders who wish to see a smoothed-out indication of a security\u2019s price over time. It is also used by larger traders who need to ensure that their trades do not move the price of the security they are trying to buy or sell. For example, a hedge fund might refrain from submitting a buy order for a price above the security\u2019s VWAP, in order to avoid artificially inflating the price of that security. Likewise, they might avoid submitting orders too far below the VWAP, so that the price is not dragged down by their sale.\n", "\nLike the VWAP, the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sma.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Simple Moving Average</a> provides traders with a less volatile view of the recent price trend of a security. Unlike the VWAP, however, the Simple Moving Average does not take into account the level of volume in that security\u2019s trading. This is because the VWAP weights each day\u2019s price change by the amount of volume occurring in that day, whereas the Simple Moving Average implicitly assumes that all trading days have the same level of volume.\n"]}
