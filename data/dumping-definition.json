It's when a country or company\u00a0<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/export.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">exports</a>\u00a0a product at a price that is lower in the foreign importing market than the price\u00a0in the exporter's domestic market. Because\u00a0dumping typically\u00a0involves substantial export volumes of a\u00a0product, it often endangers\u00a0the financial viability of the product's manufacturer or producer in the importing nation.\n", "\nDumping is considered a form of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price_discrimination.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">price discrimination</a>. It occurs when a manufacturer lowers the price of an item entering a foreign market to a level that is less than the price paid by domestic customers in the originating country. The practice\u00a0is considered intentional with the goal of obtaining a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/competitive_advantage.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">competitive advantage</a> in\u00a0the importing market.\n", "\nThe primary advantage of trade dumping is the ability to permeate a\u00a0market with product prices that are often considered\u00a0unfair. The exporting country may offer the producer a <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/subsidy.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">subsidy</a>\u00a0to counterbalance the losses\u00a0incurred when the products sell below their manufacturing cost.\u00a0One of the biggest disadvantages of trade\u00a0dumping is that subsidies\u00a0can become too costly over time to be sustainable. Additionally, trade partners who wish to restrict this form of market activity may increase restrictions on the good, which could result in increased\u00a0export costs\u00a0to\u00a0the affected country or limits on the quantity a country will <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/import.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">import</a>.\n", "\nWhile the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wto.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">World Trade Organization (WTO)</a> reserves judgment on whether dumping is an unfair competitive practice, most nations are not in favor of dumping.

Violations of such agreements may be difficult to prove and can be cost-prohibitive to enforce fully. If two countries do not have a trade agreement in place, then there is no specific ban on trade dumping\u00a0between them.\n", "\nIn January 2017, the International Trade Association (ITA) decided that the anti-dumping <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duty.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">duty</a> levied\u00a0on silica fabric products from China the previous year would remain in effect\u00a0based on the investigation by the Department of Commerce and\u00a0the International Trade Commission that showed that the silica products from China were selling at less than <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fairmarketvalue.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fair value</a> in the United States.
