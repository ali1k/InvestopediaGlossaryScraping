As a result, book value can also be thought of as the net asset value (NAV) of a company,\u00a0calculated as its total assets minus <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intangibleasset.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">intangible assets</a> (patents, goodwill) and liabilities. For the initial outlay of an investment, book value may be net or gross of expenses such as trading costs, sales taxes, service charges, and so on.\n", "\nThe formula for calculating book value per share is the total common stockholders' equity less the preferred stock, divided by the number of common shares of the company. Book value may also be known as \"net book value\" and, in the U.K., \"net asset value of a firm.\"\n", "\nBook value is the accounting value of the company's assets less all claims senior to common equity (such as the company's liabilities). The term book value derives from the accounting practice of recording asset value at the original historical cost in the books.\n", "\nWhile the book value of an asset may stay the same over time by accounting measurements, the book value of a company collectively can grow from the accumulation of earnings\u00a0generated through asset use. Since a company's book value represents the shareholding worth, comparing book value with the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketvalue.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">market value</a> of the shares can serve as an effective valuation technique when trying to decide whether shares are fairly priced.\n", "\nAs the accounting value of a firm, book value has two main uses:\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bookvaluepercommon.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Book value per share</a> (BVPS) is a method to calculate the per-share\u00a0book value\u00a0of a company based on common shareholders' equity in the company. Should the company dissolve, the book value per common share indicates the dollar value remaining for common shareholders after all assets are liquidated and all debtors are paid.\u00a0If a company\u2019s BVPS is higher than its market value per share, then its stock may be considered to be undervalued.\n", "\nIn <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/personalfinance.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">personal finance</a>, the book value of an investment is the price paid for a security or debt investment. When a company sells stock, the selling price minus\u00a0the book value is the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalgain.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">capital gain</a> or loss\u00a0from the investment.\n", "\nThere are limitations to how accurately book value can be a proxy to the shares' market worth when <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marktomarket.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mark to market</a> valuation is not applied to assets that may experience increases or decreases of their market values.\n", "\nFor example, real estate owned by a company may gain in market value\u00a0at times, while its old machinery can lose value in the market because of technological advancements. In these instances, book value at the historical cost would distort an asset or a company's true value, given its fair market price.\n", "\n<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-to-bookratio.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Price-to-book (P/B) ratio</a> as a valuation multiple is useful for value comparison between similar companies within the same industry when they follow a uniform accounting method for asset valuation. The ratio may not serve as a valid valuation basis when comparing companies from different sectors and industries whereby some companies may record their assets at historical costs and others mark their assets to market.\n", "\nAs a result, a high P/B ratio would not necessarily be a premium valuation, and conversely, a low P/B ratio would not automatically be a discount valuation.\n"]}
