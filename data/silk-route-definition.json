It stretched\u00a0from Asia to the Mediterranean, traversing <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/07/invest_china.asp\">China</a>, India, Persia, Arabia, Greece, and Italy.\n", "\nIt was dubbed the Silk Route because of the heavy silk trading that took place during that period. This valuable fabric originated in China, which initially had a monopoly on silk production until the secrets of its creation spread. In addition to silk, the route facilitated the trade of other fabrics, spices, grains, fruits and vegetables, animal hides, wood and metal work, precious stones, and other items of value.\n", "\nIn 2013, China announced plans it would revive the Silk Route, connecting it with more than 60 countries in Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Middle East.\n", "\nThe Silk Route was a series of ancient trade networks that connected China and the Far East with countries in Europe and the Middle East. The route included a group of trading posts and markets that were used to help in the storage, transport, and exchange of goods. It was also known as the Silk Road.\n", "\nTravelers used camel or horse caravans and stayed in guest houses or inns typically spaced one day\u2019s travel apart. Travelers along the Silk Route\u2019s maritime routes could\u00a0stop at ports for fresh drinking water and trade opportunities. Archaeologists and geographers pursuing research of ancient sites have been the Silk Route\u2019s most modern travelers.\n", "\nThe opening of the Silk Route brought many products that would have a big impact on the West. Many of these commodities had their roots in China and included gunpowder and paper. These became some of the most traded goods between <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/092815/chinas-top-trading-partners.asp\">China and its Western trading partners</a>. Paper was especially important, as it eventually led to the invention of the printing press, which gave way to newspapers and books.\n", "\nThere has been a push by China to reopen the Silk Route to improve cooperation among countries in Asia, Africa, and Europe.\n", "\nThe original Silk Route was established during the Han Dynasty by Zhang Quian, a Chinese official and diplomat. During a diplomatic mission, Quian was captured and detained for 13 years on his first expedition before escaping and pursuing other routes from China to Central Asia.\n", "\nThe Silk Route was popular during the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/092413/how-currency-works.asp\">Tang Dynasty</a>, from 618 to 907 A.D. Travelers could choose among a number of land and sea paths to reach their destination. The routes evolved along with territorial boundaries and changes in national leadership.\n", "\nThe Silk Route was a means to exchange goods and cultures. It also served in the development of science, technology, literature, the arts, and other fields of study.\n", "\nThe Silk Route also helped missions by Buddhist and European monks and was instrumental in spreading Buddhism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and other religions throughout the regions served by the routes.\n", "\nIn 2013, China began to officially restore the historic Silk Route under president Xi Jinping with a $900 billion strategy called \u201c<a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/one-belt-one-road-obor.asp\">One Belt, One Road</a>\u201d (OBOR). The project was a way to improve China\u2019s interconnectivity with more than 60 other countries in Asia, Europe,\u00a0and East Africa.\n", "\nAlso known as\u00a0the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), it traverses numerous land and sea routes. The Silk Road Economic Belt is primarily land-based to connect China with Central Asia, Eastern Europe, and Western Europe, while the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road is sea-based, connecting China\u2019s southern coast to the Mediterranean, Africa, South-East Asia, and Central Asia.\n", "\nChina views the venture as an important way to improve its <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/12/okuns-law.asp\">domestic growth</a>. It also serves as a way to open up new trade markets for Chinese goods, giving the country the cheapest and easiest way to export materials and goods.\n", "\nChina has passed several milestones related to the OBOR including the signing of hundreds of deals since 2016. In January 2017, a new rail\u00a0service using the East Wind freight train was introduced from Beijing to London along the historic route, passing beneath\u00a0the English Channel to reach London. The 16- to 18-day journey, travels nearly 7,500 miles and allows freight shippers an alternative to slow but relatively cheap water routes, and fast but relatively expensive air\u00a0routes. Other key OBOR routes go from China to 14 major European cities.\n"]}
