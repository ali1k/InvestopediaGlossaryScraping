Section 1250 relates only to real property, such as buildings and land.

The justification for the gain is to offset the benefit of previously used depreciation allowances. While the gains attributed to accumulated depreciation are taxed at the section 1250 recapture tax rate, any remaining gains are only subject to the long-term <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital_gains_tax.asp\">capital gains rate</a> of 15%.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"1\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nIf a property was initially purchased for $150,000, and the owner claims depreciation of $30,000, the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/adjustedcostbase.asp\">adjusted cost basis</a> for the property is considered to be $120,000. If the property is subsequently sold for $185,000, the owner has recognized an overall gain of $65,000 over the adjusted cost basis. Since the property has sold for more than the basis that had been adjusted for depreciation, the unrecaptured section 1250 gains are based on the difference between the adjusted cost basis and the original purchase price.\n", "\nThis makes the first $30,000 of the profit subject to the unrecaptured section 1250 gain, while the remaining $35,000 is taxed at the regular long-term capital gains. With that result, $30,000 would be subject to the higher capital gains tax rate of up to 25%.
