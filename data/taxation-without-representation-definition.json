The term has its origin in a slogan of the American colonials against their British rulers: \"Taxation without representation is tyranny.\"<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"18\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nOpposition to taxation without representation was one of the primary causes of the American Revolution.\n", "\nThe British Parliament began taxing its American colonists directly in 1760's, ostensibly to recoup losses incurred during the Seven Years\u2019 War of 1756 to 1763.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"19\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff One particularly despised tax, imposed by the <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stampduty.asp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stamp Act of 1765</a>, required colonial printers to pay a tax on documents used or created in the colonies, and to prove it by affixing an embossed revenue stamp to the documents.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"5\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nViolators were tried in vice-admiralty courts without a jury. The denial of a trial by peers was a second injury, in the minds of colonists.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"5\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nColonists considered the tax to be illegal because they had no representation in the Parliament that passed it and were denied the right to a trial by a jury of their peers. Delegates from nine of the 13 colonies met in New York in October 1765 to form the Stamp Act Congress, better known as the Continental Congress of 1765.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"19\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff <span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"12\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\n", "\nWilliam Samuel Johnson of Connecticut, John Dickinson of Pennsylvania, John Rutledge of South Carolina, and other prominent colonials met for 18 days.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"13\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff They then approved a \"Declaration of the Rights and Grievances of the Colonists,\" stating the delegates\u2019 joint position for other colonists to read.

After years of increasing tensions, the American Revolution began on April 19, 1775, with battles between American colonists and British soldiers in Lexington and Concord.<span class=\"ql-inline-citation\" data-cite=\"9\">\ufeff</span>\ufeff\u00a0\n", "\nOn June 7, 1776, Richard Henry Lee introduced a resolution to Congress declaring the 13 colonies free from British rule.
