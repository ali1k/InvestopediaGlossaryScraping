An incumbency certificate (or certificate of incumbency) is an official document issued by a corporation or limited liability company (<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/011216/s-corp-vs-llc-which-should-i-choose.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">LLC</a>) that lists the names of its current <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/wealth-management/040416/retired-execs-what-do-corporate-boards-pay.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">directors</a>, officers, and, occasionally, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/principal-shareholder.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">key shareholders</a>. It specifies who holds which positions within the organization, and is most frequently used to confirm the identity of individuals who are authorized to enter into legally binding transactions on the company's behalf.

Outside of the U.S., an incumbency certificate may also be known as a register of directors, certificate of officers, or secretary certificate.

Incumbency certificates such as a certificate of incumbency, certificate of officers, officer's certificate, register of directors, or secretary's certificate, all essentially provide the same information. Incumbency certificates are issued by the corporate secretary and often bear the corporate seal and may be notarized by a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/notary.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">public notary</a>. Because the secretary is the officer in charge of keeping company records, the incumbency certificate is an official act of the company, and third parties can reasonably rely on its accuracy.

An incumbency certificate contains all relevant particulars regarding the company's directors and officers, such as the incumbent's name, position, whether elected or appointed, and the term of office. It also usually includes a signature sample for comparison purposes.

A typical incumbency certificate may be worded as follows:

This mention would then be followed by a list of the directors and officers, the date, and the secretary's signature. This document can be requested by a financial institution when the company applies to open a bank account or initiates a major transaction. Also, the certificate could be requested by an attorney or anyone else who wants to confirm the legality and stated position of a director or officer within the corporation.

Anyone who is involved in a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/09/corporate-currency-risks.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">transaction</a> with a company and needs to confirm the stated position of an officer within the company may request an incumbency certificate from the secretary of the company. In practice, an incumbency certificate is often required by a bank or another financial institution when opening an account to ensure that the person who claims to be the authorized signatory of a company truly is.

Similarly, when attorneys are drafting contracts for transactions involving companies, they usually require an official incumbency certificate to determine who can legally bind the company in the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/102313/why-forward-contracts-are-foundation-all-derivatives.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">contracts</a>.

Although they may take various forms, a typical <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/boilerplate.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">boilerplate</a> incumbency certificate will look similar to the following:
