Return on invested capital (ROIC) is a calculation used to assess a company's efficiency at allocating the capital under its control to profitable investments. The return on invested capital ratio gives a sense of how well a company is using its capital to generate profits.

Comparing a company's return on invested capital with its <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wacc.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">weighted average cost of capital</a> (WACC) reveals whether <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/invested-capital.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">invested capital</a> is being used effectively. This measure is also known simply as "return on capital."

The ROIC formula is calculated by assessing the value in the denominator, total capital, which is the sum of a company's debt and equity. There are a number of ways to calculate this value. One is to subtract cash and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nibcl.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">non-interest bearing current liabilities</a> (NIBCL)—including tax liabilities and accounts payable, as long as these are not subject to interest or fees—from total assets.

Another, more precise way to write the ROIC formula is:

<span data-value="\\begin{aligned} &amp;\\text{ROIC} = \\frac{ \\text{NOPAT} }{ \\text{Invested Capital} } \\\\ &amp;\\textbf{where:}\\\\ &amp;\\text{NOPAT} = \\text{Net operating profit after tax} \\\\ \\end{aligned}">﻿<span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml">

A third method of calculating invested capital is to add the book value of a company's equity to the book value of its debt and then subtract non-operating assets, including cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and assets of discontinued operations.

A final way to calculate invested capital is to obtain the working capital figure by subtracting current liabilities from current assets. Next, you obtain non-cash working capital by subtracting cash from the working capital value you just calculated. Finally, non-cash working capital is added to a company's <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixedasset.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">fixed assets</a>. (Fixed assets are also known as long-term or non-current assets.)

The value in the numerator can also be calculated in several ways. The most straightforward way is to subtract dividends from a company's net income.

On the other hand, because a company may have benefited from a one-time source of income unrelated to its core business—a windfall from foreign exchange rate fluctuations, for example—it is often preferable to look at <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nopat.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">net operating profit after taxes</a> (NOPAT). NOPAT is calculated by adjusting the operating profit for taxes:

<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operating_profit.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Operating profit</a> is also referred to as <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebit.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">earnings before interest and tax</a> (EBIT). Many companies will report their effective tax rates for the quarter or fiscal year in their earnings releases, but not all companies do this.

ROIC is always calculated as a percentage and is usually expressed as an annualized or trailing 12-month value. It should be compared to a company's <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/costofcapital.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">cost of capital</a> to determine whether the company is creating value.

If ROIC is greater than a firm's weighted average cost of capital (WACC), the most common cost of capital metric, value is being created and these firms will trade at a premium. A common benchmark for evidence of value creation is a return in excess of 2% of the firm's cost of capital.

If a company's ROIC is less than 2%, it is considered a value destroyer. Some firms run at a zero-return level, and while they may not be destroying value, these companies have no excess capital to invest in future growth.

ROIC is one of the most important and informative valuation metrics to calculate. However, it is more important for some sectors than others, since companies that operate oil rigs or manufacture semiconductors invest capital much more intensively than those that require less equipment.

One downside of this metric is that it tells nothing about what segment of the business is generating value. If you make your calculation based on <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/netincome.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">net income</a> (minus dividends) instead of NOPAT, the result can be even more opaque, since the return may derive from a single, non-recurring event.

ROIC provides the necessary context for other metrics such as the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-earningsratio.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">P/E ratio</a>. Viewed in isolation, the P/E ratio might suggest a company is oversold, but the decline could be due to the fact that the company is no longer generating value for shareholders at the same rate (or at all). On the other hand, companies that consistently generate high rates of return on invested capital probably deserve to trade at a premium compared to other stocks, even if their P/E ratios seem prohibitively high.

As a historical example, let's consider Target Corporation's (<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=tgt" rel="noopener noreferrer">TGT</a>) fourth-quarter 2018 earnings release. The company calculated its trailing 12-month month ROIC for that year, showing the components that went into the calculation:

The ROIC calculation begins with earnings from continuing operations before interest expenses and income taxes (EBIT), then adds operating lease interest and subtracts income taxes, yielding a net profit after taxes of $3.5 billion: this is the numerator.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿ Next, add the current portion of long-term debt and other borrowings, the non-current portion of <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/longtermdebt.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">long-term debt</a>, shareholders equity, and capitalized operating lease obligations.

Subtract <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashandcashequivalents.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">cash and cash equivalents</a> and net assets of <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/discontinued-operations.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">discontinued operations</a>, which yields total invested capital of $22.2 billion. Average this figure with the invested capital from the end of the prior-year period ($22.3 billion), and you end up with a denominator of $22.2 billion.

The resulting after-tax return on invested capital is 15.9%. The company attributed the increase over the previous 12 months largely to the effects of the tax bill passed in late 2017. This calculation would have been difficult to obtain from the income statement and balance sheet alone, since the asterisked values are buried in an addendum. For this reason, calculating ROIC can be tricky, but it is worth arriving at a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/ballpark-figure.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">ballpark figure</a> in order to assess a company's efficiency at putting capital to work.

Invested capital is the total amount of money raised by a company by issuing securities (equity to shareholders and debt to <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bondholder.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">bondholders</a>), where the total debt and capital <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lease.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">lease</a> obligations are added to the amount of equity issued to investors. Invested capital is not a line item in the company's financial statement because debt, capital leases, and stockholder’s equity are each listed separately in the balance sheet.

Return on invested capital (ROIC) assesses a company's efficiency at allocating the capital under its control to profitable investments or projects. The ROIC ratio gives a sense of how well a company is using the money it has raised externally to generate returns. Comparing a company's return on invested capital with its weighted average cost of capital (WACC) reveals whether invested capital is being used effectively.

ROIC takes into account four key components: operating income, tax rates, book value, and time. The ROIC formula is net operating profit after tax (NOPTAT) divided by invested capital. Companies with a steady or improving return on capital are unlikely to put significant amounts of new capital to work.
