A gold option is an <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/optionscontract.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">options contract</a> that utilizes either physical gold or gold futures as its <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underlying-asset.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">underlying asset</a>.

A gold <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">call option</a> would give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy bullion at a future date at a set price, while a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/putoption.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">put option</a> would grant the holder the right to sell it at a predetermined price level. The option agreement terms will list details such as the delivery date, quantity, and strike price, which are all predetermined.

A gold option is a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/derivative.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">derivative</a> that has physical gold, or <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futures.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">futures</a> on physical gold, as the underlying asset.

The gold options contract is an agreement between two parties to facilitate a potential transaction on a quantity of <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/09/why-gold-matters.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">gold</a>. The contract lists a preset price, known as the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strikeprice.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">strike price</a>, and an expiration date.

There are two primary types of options contracts: put options and call options. However, there are four types of participants as both the call and put can be either bought or sold.

If neither the holder of the call or put options exercise their rights, the contract will expire as worthless.

A gold option is similar in some ways to a gold <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futurescontract.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">futures contract</a> in that the price, the expiration date, and the dollar amount are preset for both. However, with a futures contract, there is an obligation to uphold the agreement and either buy or sell the agreed-upon quantity of gold at the agreed-upon price.

Conversely, an investor who holds a gold option has the right, but not the obligation, to claim the relevant position, which will depend on if they hold the call option or the put option.

Gold options contracts trade on various derivatives <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exchange.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">exchanges</a> around the world. In the U.S., investors can find gold options listed on the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/comex.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">COMEX</a> exchange.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2">﻿</span>﻿

COMEX is the primary futures and options market for trading metals such as gold, silver, copper, and aluminum. Formerly known as the Commodity Exchange Inc., COMEX merged with the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nymex.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Mercantile Exchange</a> (NYMEX) in 1994 and became the division responsible for metals trading.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿ Today, COMEX—and the NYMEX more broadly—operates as a division of the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cme.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chicago Mercantile Exchange</a> (CME).<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4">﻿</span>﻿

COMEX gold options actually use gold futures, rather than physical gold directly, and so are <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cash-settled-options.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">cash-settled</a>. These gold futures have a contract size of 100 <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/troyounce.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">troy ounces</a> each and require <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/physicaldelivery.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">physical delivery</a> if not closed out.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5">﻿</span>﻿

As with other types of options, an investor would only want to exercise their gold option rights if the market conditions make it beneficial.

If at the time the buyer can use, or exercise, their option, gold is trading at a price significantly higher than the strike price, the investor would benefit by exercising their option. The investor could then turn around and quickly sell that gold on the open <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">market</a> for a quick profit.

Should, on the other hand, gold be trading at or near the strike price, the investor may <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/breakeven-price.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">break even</a> or perhaps even take a loss, once their initial cost to purchase the option is factored in.
