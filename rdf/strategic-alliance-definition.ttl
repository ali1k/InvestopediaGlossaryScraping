A strategic alliance is an arrangement between two companies to undertake a mutually beneficial project while each retains its independence. The agreement is less complex and less binding than a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jointventure.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">joint venture</a>, in which two businesses pool resources to create a separate business entity.

A company may enter into a strategic alliance to expand into a new market, improve its product line, or develop an edge over a competitor. The arrangement allows two businesses to work toward a common goal that will benefit both.

The relationship may be short- or long-term and the agreement may be formal or informal.

While the strategic alliance can be an informal alliance, the responsibilities of each member are clearly defined. The needs and benefits gained by the partnered businesses will dictate how long the coalitionÂ is in effect.

The effects of forming a strategic alliance can include allowing each of the businesses to achieve <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/organicgrowth.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">organic growth</a> more quickly than if they had acted alone.

The partnership entails sharing complimentary resources from each partner for the overall benefit of the alliance.

Strategic alliances can be flexible and some of the burdens that a joint venture could include. The two firms do not need to merge capital and can remain independent of one another.

A <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/06/themerger.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">strategic alliance</a> can, however, bring its own risks. While the agreement is usually clear for both companies, there may be differences in how the firms conduct business. Differences can create conflict. Further, if the alliance requires the parties to share proprietary information, there must be trust between the two allies.

In a long-term strategic alliance, one party may become dependent on the other. Disruption of the alliance can endanger the health of the company.

The deal between Starbucks and Barnes&amp;Noble is a classic example of a strategic alliance. Starbucks brews the coffee. Barnes&amp;Noble stocks the books. Both companies do what they do best while sharing the costs of space to the benefit of both companies.

Strategic alliances can come in many sizes and forms:
