Identity theft is the crime of obtaining the personal or financial information of another person to use their identity to commit fraud, such as making unauthorized transactions or purchases. Identity theft is committed in many different ways and its victims are typically left with damage to their credit, finances, and reputation.

Identity theft occurs when someone steals your personal information—such as your <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/ssn.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Social Security number</a>, bank account number, and credit card information. Identity theft can be committed in many different ways. Some identity thieves sift through trash bins looking for bank account and credit card statements. More high-tech methods involve accessing corporate databases to steal lists of customer information. Once identity thieves have the information they are looking for, they can ruin a person's <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditrating.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">credit rating</a> and the standing of other personal information.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿

Identity thieves increasingly <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/news/was-i-hacked-find-out-if-equifax-breach-affects-you/" rel="noopener noreferrer">use computer technology</a> to obtain other people's personal information for identity fraud. To find such information, they may search the hard drives of stolen or discarded computers; hack into computers or computer networks; access computer-based public records; use information-gathering malware to infect computers; browse <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/social-networking.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">social networking</a> sites; or use deceptive emails or text messages.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿

There are several types of identity theft including:

In financial identity theft, someone uses another person's identity or information to obtain credit, goods, services, or benefits. This is the most common form of identity theft.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿

If identity thieves obtain your Social Security number, they can use it to apply for credit cards and loans and then not pay outstanding balances. Fraudsters can also use your number to receive medical, disability, and other benefits.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2">﻿</span>﻿

In <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/medical-identity-theft.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">medical identity theft</a>, someone poses as another person to obtain free medical care. <span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿

<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/synthetic-identity-theft.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Synthetic identity theft</a> is a type of fraud in which a criminal combines real (usually stolen) and fake information to create a new identity, which is used to open fraudulent accounts and make fraudulent purchases. Synthetic identity theft allows the criminal to steal money from any credit card companies or lenders who extend credit based on the fake identity.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿

In child identity theft, someone uses a child's identity for various forms of personal gain. This is common, as children typically do not have information associated with them that could pose obstacles for the perpetrator. The fraudster may use the child's name and Social Security number to obtain a residence, find employment, obtain loans, or avoid arrest on outstanding warrants. Often, the victim is a family member, the child of a friend, or someone else close to the perpetrator. Some people even steal the personal information of deceased loves ones.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿

Tax identity theft occurs when someone uses your personal information, including your Social Security number, to file a bogus state or federal tax return in your name and collect a refund.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿

In criminal identity theft, a criminal poses as another person during an arrest to try to avoid a summons, prevent the discovery of a warrant issued in their real name, or avoid an arrest or conviction record.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿

Many types of identity theft can be prevented. One way is to continually check the accuracy of personal documents and promptly deal with any discrepancies.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4">﻿</span>﻿
