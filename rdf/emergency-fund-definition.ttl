The term emergency fund refers to money stashed away that people can use in times of <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial_distress.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">financial distress</a>. The purpose of an emergency fund is to improve financial security by creating a safety net that can be used to meet emergency expenses, such as an illness or major home repairs.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8">﻿</span>﻿ Assets in an emergency fund tend to be cash or other highly <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidasset.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">liquid assets</a>. This reduces the need to either draw from high-interest debt options, such as credit cards or <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unsecuredloan.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">unsecured loans</a>, or the need to undermine your future security by tapping into retirement funds.

As mentioned above, an emergency fund is established when an individual puts away money that is intended to be used during times of financial hardship. This includes the loss of a job, a debilitating illness, a major repair to home or car, not to mention the kind of major national crisis the coronavirus <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/special-economic-impact-of-pandemics-4800597" rel="noopener noreferrer">pandemic</a> created following the outbreak in 2020.

The size of your emergency fund depends on a number of factors including your financial situation, expenses, lifestyle, and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debt.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">debts</a>. According to most financial experts, you should be able to cover anywhere between three to six months’ worth of expenses.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9">﻿</span>﻿

Starting early is the key to setting up an emergency fund because it helps you build up a comfortable cushion against unexpected emergencies later in life.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10">﻿</span>﻿ Getting a start on emergency funds is relatively easy. Here are two simple ways to begin saving for one:

As previously noted, you should consider putting money for an emergency fund into a vehicle that is easily accessible and can be easily <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidate.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">liquidated</a>. For instance, consider putting your money away in a high-interest <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/savingsaccount.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">savings account</a> or a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/moneymarketaccount.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">money market account</a>. These accounts allow you the access you'll need in an emergency and also prevent you from incurring fees and time delays associated with other vehicles like <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="4" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brokerageaccount.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">brokerage accounts</a>. More on this below.

You should consider <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/personal-finance/how-to-build-emergency-fund/" rel="noopener noreferrer">building an emergency fund</a> before venturing into volatile investment vehicles such as stocks. Whereas the latter offer greater long-term growth potential than cash and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashequivalents.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">cash equivalents</a>, their value can suddenly decrease in the event of an economic downturn, as the coronavirus crisis made vividly clear. Should that be the moment you need to tap them, you could lose more value. An emergency fund protects your portfolio against that risk.

While storing cash in a bank account may be the safest approach, there are other relatively <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/13/safe-liquid-investment-for-emergencies.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">secure ways to store a part of your emergency fund</a> that offer greater interest-earning potential. These include <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/moneymarket.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">money market</a> accounts or no-penalty <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/certificateofdeposit.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">certificates of deposit</a> (CDs), which don’t charge savers a fee if they need to pull their money out before the maturity date.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7">﻿</span>﻿

Research shows most Americans aren't prepared for an unexpected expense of just $400, let alone for an emergency. In fact, a 2019 survey by the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalreservesystem.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Federal Reserve</a> found that:

A number of major employers introduced programs encouraging emergency savings because of the effects of financial instability on <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/productivity.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">productivity</a> and retirement security. The following is a list of programs offered by some major companies for their employees:

Here's a hypothetical example to show how emergency funds work. Let's say a married couple has monthly expenses totaling $5,000. This includes the couple's <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/mortgage-rates/payment-structure/" rel="noopener noreferrer">mortgage payments</a>, food bills, car payments, and other necessary outlays. Using the three-month rule, the couple needs to set aside at least $15,000 (or $30,000 for six months) to address any unexpected financial burdens.

The funds are typically held in the form of highly liquid assets, such as <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/checking-vs-savings-accounts-4783514" rel="noopener noreferrer">checking or savings accounts</a>. These vehicles allow quick access to cash to pay expenses during an emergency situation.
