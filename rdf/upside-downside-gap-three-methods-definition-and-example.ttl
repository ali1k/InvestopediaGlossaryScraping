Suppose the market is engaged in a current uptrend. The rally continues on the first candle in a healthy session with the close well above the open, generating a wide range real body. This increases the bull's confidence, while putting bears on the defensive. Their caution is justified because the second candle opens with a gap up and healthy buying pressure that lifts the security to a new high. <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profittaking.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Profit-taking</a> causes the third candle to close the gap between the first and second candles.

Paul has spotted an Upside Gap Three Methods pattern on the chart of Cellectis S.A. and wants to use the formation to enter a long position in the direction of the trend and set his risk parameters. He could execute a trade at the closing price of the third candle at $16.39 and place a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stop-lossorder.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">stop-loss order</a> below the first candle’s low at $15.75.
