    invp:description """
A government-wide acquisition contract (GWAC) is a contract in which multiple government agencies align their needs and purchase a contract for goods or services. Government-wide acquisition contracts allow for economies of scale, which usually reduce per unit costs. These contracts are typically used to purchase new technology, such as computers. With a GWAC, the federal government can get innovative solutions for information technology systems at an improved cost to <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/tax/10/history-taxes.asp">taxpayers</a> footing the bill. This type of contract may be spearheaded by one particular agency with the expectation that more agencies will follow suit.

The rise of government-wide acquisition contracts has allowed <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/11/government-regulations.asp">government agencies</a> to take advantage of their size to negotiate lower prices. Their use has also created an environment in which a single vendor will provide product and service support to more personnel. By having one agency evaluate a vendor for multiple agencies' needs, the federal government can reduce the likelihood that other agencies will have to "reinvent the wheel" by undertaking their own, separate vetting process.

The VETS 2 GWAC is uniquely set-aside for the exclusive use of Service-Disabled, Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB). VETS 2 is designed to provide a series of information technology systems for the federal government, including new and emerging technologies.
