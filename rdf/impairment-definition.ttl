In <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accounting.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">accounting</a>, impairment describes a permanent reduction in the value of a company's asset, typically a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixedasset.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">fixed asset</a> or an <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intangibleasset.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">intangible asset</a>. When testing an asset for impairment, the total profit, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="4" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashflow.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">cash flow</a>, or other benefit expected to be generated by that specific asset is periodically compared with its current <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="5" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bookvalue.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">book value</a>. If it is determined that the book value of the asset exceeds the future cash flow or benefit of the asset, the difference between the two is written off and the value of the asset declines on the company's balance sheet.

Impairment is commonly used to describe a drastic reduction in the recoverable amount of a fixed asset. Impairment may occur when there is a change in legal or economic circumstances surrounding a company or a casualty <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/casualty-loss.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">loss</a> from unforeseen devastation.

For example, a construction company may experience impairment of its outdoor machinery and equipment in the aftermath of a natural disaster. It appears as a sudden and large decline in the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fairvalue.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">fair value</a> of an asset to below its <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/carryingvalue.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">carrying value</a>. An asset's carrying value, also known as its book value, is the value of the asset net of <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accumulated-depreciation.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">accumulated depreciation</a> that is recorded on a company's balance sheet.

An accountant tests assets for potential impairment periodically; if any impairment exists, the accountant <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/write-off.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">writes off</a> the difference between the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/050115/what-difference-between-carrying-value-and-fair-value.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">fair value and the carrying value</a>. Fair value is normally derived as the sum of an asset's undiscounted expected future cash flows and its expected <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/salvagevalue.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">salvage value</a>, which is what the company expects to receive from selling or disposing of the asset at the end of its life.

Other accounts that may be impaired, and thus need to be reviewed and written down, are the company's <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/goodwill-impairment.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">goodwill</a> and accounts receivable. Long-term assets are particularly at risk of impairment because the carrying value has a longer span of time to become potentially impaired.

Similar to an <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/impairedasset.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">impaired asset</a>, a company's capital can also become impaired. <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/impaired-capital.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Impaired capital</a> event occurs when a company's total capital becomes less than the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" href="https://debitoor.com/dictionary/impairment" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">par value</a> of the company's <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="4" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/parvalue.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">capital stock</a>. However, unlike the impairment of an asset, impaired capital can naturally reverse when the company's total capital increases back above the par value of its capital stock.

Fixed assets, such as machinery and equipment, depreciate in value over time. The amount of <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/depreciation.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">depreciation</a> taken each accounting period is based on a predetermined schedule using either <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/straightlinebasis.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">straight line</a> or one of multiple <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accelerateddepreciation.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">accelerated depreciation</a> methods. Depreciation schedules allow for a set distribution of the reduction of an asset's value over its entire lifetime. Unlike impairment, which accounts for an unusual and drastic drop in the fair value of an asset, depreciation is used to account for typical wear and tear on fixed assets over time.

Under <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gaap.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">generally accepted accounting principles</a> (GAAP), assets are considered to be impaired when the fair value falls below the book value. Any write-off due to an impairment loss can have adverse affects on a company's balance sheet and its resulting <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0910/6-basic-financial-ratios-and-what-they-tell-you.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">financial ratios</a>. It is, therefore, very important for a company to test its assets for impairment periodically. Certain assets, such as the intangible goodwill, must be tested for impairment on an annual basis in order to ensure the value of assets are not inflated on the balance sheet.

GAAP also recommends that companies take into consideration events and economic circumstances that occur between annual impairment tests in order to determine if it is "more likely than not" that the fair value of an asset has dropped below its carrying value.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿ Specific situations where an asset might become impaired and unrecoverable include when there is a significant change to an asset's intended use, decrease in consumer demand, damage to the asset, or adverse changes to legal factors that affect the asset. If these types of situations arise mid-year, it's important to test for impairment immediately.

Standard GAAP practice is to test fixed assets for impairment at the lowest level where there are identifiable cash flows. For example, an auto manufacturer should test for impairment for each of the machines in a manufacturing plant rather than for the high-level manufacturing plant itself. However, if there are no identifiable cash flows at this low level, it's allowable to test for impairment at the asset group or entity level.

ABC Company, based in Florida, purchased a building many years ago at a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/historical-cost.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">historical cost</a> of $250,000. It has taken a total of $100,000 in depreciation on the building, and therefore has $100,000 in accumulated depreciation. The building's carrying value, or book value, is $150,000 on the company's balance sheet. A category 5 hurricane damages the structure significantly, and the company determines the situation qualifies for impairment testing.

After assessing the damages, ABC Company determines the building is now only worth $100,000. The building is therefore impaired and the asset value must be written-down to prevent overstatement on the balance sheet. A debit entry is made to "Loss from Impairment," which will appear on the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incomestatement.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">income statement</a> as a reduction of <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/netincome.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">net income</a>, in the amount of $50,000 ($150,000 book value - $100,000 calculated fair value). As part of the same entry, a $50,000 credit is also made to the building's asset account, to reduce the asset's balance, or to another balance sheet account called the "Provision for Impairment Losses."
