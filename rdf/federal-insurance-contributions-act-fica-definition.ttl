The Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) is a U.S. law that mandates a payroll tax on the paychecks of employees, as well as contributions from employers, to fund the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/social-security-benefits.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Social Security</a> and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/medicare.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Medicare</a> programs. For self-employed persons, there is an equivalent law called the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/seca.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Self-Employed Contributions Act</a> (SECA).<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4">﻿</span>﻿﻿

FICA contributions are mandatory, and rates are set annually, although not necessarily changed every year—they remained stable between 2020 and 2021, for example. The amount of the FICA payment depends on the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/income.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">income</a> of the employee: the higher the income, the higher the FICA payment.

However, for Social Security contributions there's a maximum <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxable-wage-base.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">wage base</a>, after which no contributions are levied on additional income. The federal government withholds <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/social-security-tax.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Social Security taxes</a> up to the annual wage base, which was set at $137,700 in 2020 and $142,800 in 2021.﻿

The Social Security <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxrate.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">tax rate</a> is 6.2%, and the Medicare tax rate is 1.45% for 2020 and 2021. The employer pays a tax equal to the amounts withheld from employee earnings.﻿<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5">﻿</span>﻿

While there is no maximum to the Medicare contribution, there is an additional 0.9% tax on wages over $200,000 for individuals ($250,000 for <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mfj.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">married couples filing jointly</a>) paid by employees. In total, the Additional Medicare Tax is 2.35% (1.45% plus 0.9%). Employers are not required to match the additional Medicare levy.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿﻿

Under SECA, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/self-employed.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">self-employed</a> people pay both the employee and employer portions of the SECA-related tax. The amount that represents the employer's share (half) is a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deductible.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">deductible</a> business expense.

Someone earning $50,000 will pay $3,825 of FICA contributions in 2021, broken down as $3,100 of Social Security tax, and $725 of Medicare. The person's employer would pay the same amount.

A single person earning $250,000, on the other hand, will pay $12,929. The calculation of this second example is slightly more complex. The person will pay 6.2% of the first $142,800 earned for Social Security ($8,854), then 1.45% of the first $200,000 earned for Medicare ($2,900) and finally 2.35% of the $50,000 in income above $200,000 for Medicare ($1,175). In this last case, the employer would pay only $12,479, as it is not responsible for the additional 0.9% tax for an income of more than $200,000.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4">﻿</span>﻿

You can, of course, calculate contributions with a calculator, or turn to online tools, such as <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" href="http://www.moneychimp.com/features/fica.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">this</a>, to do the work for you, though these tools are not always guaranteed to be accurate.

On March 27, 2020, President Donald Trump signed a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/how-the-coronavirus-stimulus-bills-affect-you-4800404#citation-7" rel="noopener noreferrer">$2 trillion coronavirus emergency stimulus package</a> into law. Under the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/coronavirus-aid-relief-and-economic-security-cares-act-4800707" rel="noopener noreferrer">CARES Act</a>, employers (not employees) can defer their share of Social Security taxes through Dec. 31, 2020—50% of the deferred amount will be due Dec. 31, 2021, and the other half by Dec. 31, 2022.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6">﻿</span>﻿

The law applies to the self-employed too. Certain employers will also be eligible to claim <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/what-is-the-employee-retention-credit-and-how-to-get-it-4802575" rel="noopener noreferrer">a payroll tax credit for employees whom they continue to pay</a> but who are not working due to the crisis.
