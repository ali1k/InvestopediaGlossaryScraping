The Occupational Safety and Health Act is a law passed by the U.S. Congress in 1970 to ensure safe workplace conditions around the country. It established the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), which sets and enforces workplace health and safety standards.

Signed into law by President Richard Nixon in December 1970, the Occupational Safety and Health Act (commonly called the OSH Act) was enacted to create safe working conditions by authorizing standard work practices. <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/congress.asp">Congress</a> found that workplace personal injuries and illnesses contributed to a decline in production and wages, plus an increase in medical expenses and disability compensation. The act is designed to ensure that workers are protected from hazards that may affect their safety and health, such as exposure to toxic chemicals, damaging noise, thermal stresses, and unsanitary conditions.

To aid states and other U.S. territories in the adoption of safe and healthful <a class="pseudoStyle" data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/09/unions-workers.asp">working conditions</a>, the act provided for related research, education, and training. Most states partially or fully control the occupational health and safety standards for their employees.

The Occupational Safety and Health Act established two major entities:

The OSH Act covers most private-sector employers and their workers, in addition to some public-sector employers and workers in the 50 states and certain territories and jurisdictions under federal authority.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"></span> Individuals not protected by the law include self-employed individuals, workers on small family farms, and those working in an industry regulated by a separate federal agency.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) acts as <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/120914/8-federal-laws-protect-employees.asp">the enforcement arm</a> of the Occupational Safety and Health Act. Although the legislation gave OSHA the authority to create industry-specific guidelines, it also outlined a “general duty” clause, which applies to all employers in all industries. This clause, officially Section 5(a)(1) of the act, in effect serves as OSHA's mandate, stipulating that employers must provide a safe environment for their workers.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"></span>

In some parts of the country, an OSHA-approved state agency helps set and enforce job safety standards. But these standards must be at least as stringent as federal guidelines'.

OSHA enforces its regulations and standards by conducting inspections of workplaces and work sites. Violators face penalties and fines, which are adjusted annually for inflation.

In 2021, infractions can incur penalties ranging from $975 to $13,653 per violation. In the most extreme cases—for what OSHA deems "willful or repeated" behavior—the maximum imposed goes as high as $136,532 per violation.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"></span>

The size of the fine depends on the seriousness of the violation and the number of workers the company employs: Businesses with 10 or fewer employees might receive up to an 80% reduction in the penalty; those with 21-30 receive 50%. Those with more than 250 workers pay the full amount.
