Liquidity Preference Theory is a model that suggests that an investor should demand a higher interest rate or premium on securities with long-term <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maturity.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">maturities</a> that carry greater risk because, all other factors being equal, investors prefer cash or other highly liquid holdings.

Liquidity Preference Theory suggests that investors demand progressively higher premiums on medium and long-term securities as opposed to short-term securities. According to the theory, which was developed by <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/john_maynard_keynes.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">John Maynard Keynes</a> in support of his idea that the demand for liquidity holds speculative power, liquid investments are easier to cash in for full value.

Cash is commonly accepted as the most liquid asset. According to the liquidity preference theory, interest rates on short-term securities are lower because investors are not sacrificing liquidity for greater time frames than medium or longer-term securities. 

Keynes introduced Liquidity Preference Theory in his book<em> The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money</em>. Keynes describes the theory in terms of three motives that determine the demand for liquidity:

When higher interest rates are offered, investors give up liquidity in exchange for higher rates. As an example, if interest rates are rising and bond prices are falling, an investor may sell their low paying bonds and buy higher-paying bonds or hold onto the cash and wait for an even better rate of return.

For the investor to sacrifice liquidity, they must receive a higher rate of return in exchange for agreeing to have the cash tied up for a longer period of time.
