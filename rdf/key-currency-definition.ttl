A key currency refers to a type of money which is stable, does not fluctuate much, and provides the foundation for exchange rates for international transactions. Because of their global use, key currencies tend to set the value of other currencies. Also, these currencies tend to have a stable valuation over time. A key currency usually comes from a country that is financially strong, economically stable and developed, and one that is involved in the global market.

Key currency rates do nevertheless fluctuate daily, and updated key currency rates can appear in financial institutions and financial reporting outlets.

Reserve currency helps these nations support investments, complete international business transactions, and pay international debt obligations. These banks may also hold key currency to influence their domestic exchange rate. A large percentage of commodities, such as gold and oil, are priced in the key and reserve currency, causing other countries to hold this currency to pay for these goods. However, while a currency may identify as a reserve currency, it may not be considered a key currency.
