Original face is the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/parvalue.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">par value</a> of a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mbs.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">mortgage-backed security (MBS)</a> at the time it is<strong> </strong>issued. In other words, it tells us the<strong> </strong>total<strong> </strong><a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/principal.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">principal</a> amount originally owed on <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="4" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/loan.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">loans</a><strong> </strong>made to buy homes or how much the MBS, the vehicle <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="5" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investment.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">invested</a><strong> </strong>in these <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="6" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortgage.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">mortgages</a>, is initially worth.

Original face is also referred to as original <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/facevalue.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">face value</a>.

Mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) are home loans that are sold by their <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/issuer.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">issuing</a> banks to a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gse.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">government-sponsored enterprise</a> (GSE) or financial company and then bundled together into a single investable <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">security</a>. Unlike most other types of <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="4" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">bonds</a>, MBSs return both principal and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="5" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interest.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">interest</a> to the holder in periodic payments, usually on a monthly basis.

When an MBS is initially structured, the par value given to the pool is called the original face—the total outstanding balance at the time of its inception. Over time, this balance will reduce as more payments come in from borrowers, pulling the actual value of the MBS lower than the original face value.

MBSs are often tailored for specific needs. For instance, if an <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/institutionalinvestor.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">institutional investor</a> made a request for a particular face value in addition to other characteristics, the issuer would do its best to match it. 

Because mortgages don't always come in easily rounded numbers, especially when <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investor.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">investors</a> are looking for a particular borrower profile, the targeted original face and the actual original face will likely be a bit different. This is referred to as <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/variance.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">variance</a>. Usually, the variance is fairly minimal, such as a $1 million MBS coming in with a $1,010,000 original face.

Once payments commence, the shrinking total outstanding balance owed on the MBS is referred to as <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/current_face.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">current face</a>. The <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/poolfactor.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">pool factor</a>, a measure of how much of the original loan principal remains, can be calculated by taking the current face and dividing it by the original face. 

By definition, a newly issued MBS will have a pool factor of one at inception; in other words, the original face will equal the current face. As the principal is paid down, the change in the pool factor becomes a measure of <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/prepayment.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">prepayment rates</a>. 

When <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">interest rates</a> are low and it becomes cheaper to borrow, homeowners are incentivized to <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/refinance.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">refinance</a> their mortgages, resulting in higher levels of prepayment of the original loans that the MBS are invested in. This increase will show in the pool factor as the outstanding principal balance (current face) shrinks faster than in previous months, and the pool factor drops further than its normal monthly average.

MBS investors generally do not want to see the pool factor dropping faster than planned because it results in a lower overall <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/return.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">return</a> for them. When principal is returned early, future interest payments will not be paid on that part of the principal. Quicker repayments also result in investors suddenly finding themselves saddled with <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">capital</a> to reinvest in a low-interest environment where <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/y/yield.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">yields</a> are hard to come by.

The original face gives investors the option to choose how much money they potentially want to earn from an investment. Later on down the line, the figure continues to be consulted as a key reference point, enabling investors to establish how an MBS is doing now compared to when it first started out—and determine its <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnoninvestment.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">return on investment (ROI)</a>.

The original face is used by <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trader.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">traders</a> and investors in <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valuation.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">valuations</a><strong> </strong>and models over the life of the MBS. Identifying the par value of an MBS at its time of creation and then comparing this to the current face should give them an idea of how reliable valuation assumptions were.

Looking at both can reveal, for example, whether the assumed prepayment rate was accurate and if the valuation is higher or lower than it should be in light of the actual <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/prepaymentrisk.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">prepayment risk</a> to date.
