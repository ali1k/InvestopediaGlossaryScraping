Judgment proof is a description of a person who does not have enough assets for a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditor.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">creditor</a> to seize when a court order requires debt repayment. A <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtor.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">debtor</a> who is broke and unemployed can be considered judgment proof, as can a debtor who only has certain legally protected types of assets or income.

Being judgment proof, also called “collection proof,” is not permanent. <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/judgement.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Judgments</a> can be valid for many years, and creditors can continue to try to collect what the judgment allows long after they win a lawsuit against a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/delinquent.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">delinquent</a> borrower.

In general, two criteria are used to identify a person as judgment proof. The first one is the absence of proper <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/income.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">income</a>. An individual who is unemployed or working a low-paying job that pays <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/minimum_wage.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">minimum wage</a> and earns enough to barely survive may fit into this category.

The second is the absence of <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">assets</a>, such as bank accounts or real estate that can be used as <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/collateral.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">collateral</a> by creditors. Income earned from the government, including social security, unemployment benefits, and disability, is exempt from collection by creditor agencies.

When a person is deemed judgment proof, creditors are unable to collect any money they owe. This status is considered temporary until the individual is able to earn a proper income.

Most lawyers advise debtors not to respond to <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debt-collector.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">debt collectors</a> if they believe they are judgment proof. This way, the company or agency responsible for recovering money owed on delinquent accounts receives a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/default-judgment.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">default judgment</a>.

Suppose a person—call him Mike—becomes too sick to work and uses a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditcard.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">credit card</a> to pay his living expenses and medical bills for a year. He recovers from his illness and goes back to work, but he can’t afford to repay the debt he accumulated. The credit card company fails in its debt collection efforts, then sells Mike’s unpaid debt to a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/collectionagency.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">collection agency</a>.

The collection agency contacts Mike repeatedly, but he doesn’t pay them anything; he’s struggling to hang onto his house, buy groceries, and keep the lights on. As a last resort, the collection agency sues Mike and obtains a judgment against him for the unpaid <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debt.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">debt</a>. The agency now has a court order requiring Mike to repay a sum the court has determined to be valid.

However, because Mike barely earns more than the minimum wage, his wages can’t be <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/garnishment.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">garnished</a>, and because he lives in a state that protects his primary residence from creditors, the collection agency can’t place a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lien.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">lien</a> on his house. Mike has no money in the bank, and he doesn’t own a car or any other assets that can be seized and sold to repay his debt. Mike is currently judgment proof.

If Mike’s financial circumstances improve next year and he starts earning significantly more, the collection agency might then be able to garnish a percentage of his wages to start recouping what it is owed. Because judgments can remain valid for a long time and be renewed once they expire, creditors may be able to collect on Mike's debt many years down the road.
