Y-shares are an <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/institutionalshares.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">institutional share</a> class offered in open-end mutual funds. Targeting institutional investors, the share class often has a high minimum investment, beginning at approximately $25,000. This share class also offers the benefit of waived or limited load charges and lower comparative total annual fees.

Y-shares are an alternative to <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/institutionalshares.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">I-shares</a> which are in the most commonly offered mutual fund share class for <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/institutionalinvestor.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">institutional investors</a>. Y-shares have features and characteristics that are tailored to institutions.

High minimum investments are one of the most distinguishable characteristics of Y-shares and other institutional shares classes. Minimum investments typically begin at $25,000 and can be as high as $5 million. Sales loads are usually not required for Y-shares, which allows institutional investors to buy and sell shares with no added commission charges.

Since Y-shares are not associated with intermediary sales charges, they also usually do not pay any distribution fees or <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/12b-1fees.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">12b-1 fees</a> from the fund’s expenses. Without 12b-1 fees, the total expense ratios are lower overall than other share classes in the fund, which is another benefit for institutional investors.

While Y-shares are typically reserved for institutional investors, they may allow investment from retirement plan investors in some cases. Most <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutualfund.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">mutual funds</a> will have designated retirement share classes with similar benefits to institutional shares.

Funds without retirement share classes may allow pooled fund investments in Y-shares from retirement plans that collectively seek investment in the fund. This can provide a significant benefit to retirement shareholders, who would take part in the savings from the share class’s lower fees.

Putnam Investments is one investment manager that offers Y-shares across many of its funds as the primary share class for institutional investors. The <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" href="https://www.putnam.com/individual/mutual-funds/funds/36-global-equity-fund/A" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Putnam Global Equity Fund</a> provides one example. The Fund offers <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/a-shares.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">A-shares</a>, B-shares, C-shares, M-shares, R-shares, R6-shares, T-shares, and Y-shares.

The Putnam Global Equity Fund’s Y-share class charges no front-end or back-end sales commissions. The share class also charges no 12b-1 fees, which helps it to have one of the lowest annual expense ratios in the Fund at 0.90%. This compares to total annual fund operating expenses of 1.9% for the B-shares and C-shares.

Performance for the Y-shares as of March 30, 2020, was also one of the highest in the Fund for the last five years at 5.81%.
