    invp:description """
Exercise means to put into effect the right to buy or sell the underlying financial instrument specified in an <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/optionscontract.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">options contract</a>. In options trading, the holder of an option has the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the option's <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underlying-security.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">underlying security</a> at a specified price on or before a specified date in the future.

If the owner of an option decides to buy or sell the underlying instrument—instead of allowing the contract to <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expirationdate.asp">expire</a> worthless or <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/closeposition.asp">closing out the position</a>—they will be "exercising the option," or making use of the right or privilege that is available in the contract.

An options holder may exercise their right to buy or sell the contract's underlying shares at a specified price—also called the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/strike-price/">strike price</a>.

To exercise an option, you simply advise your broker that you wish to exercise the option in your contract. Your broker will initiate an <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" href="https://www.nasdaq.com/investing/glossary/e/exercise-notice">exercise notice</a>, which informs the seller or <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/writer.asp">writer</a> of the contract that you are exercising the option. The notice is forwarded to the option seller via the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC). The seller is obligated to fulfill the terms of an options contract if the holder exercises the contract.

The majority of options contracts are not exercised but, instead, are allowed to expire worthless or are closed by opposing positions. For example, the holder of an option can close out a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long.asp">long</a> call or put prior to expiration by selling it, assuming the contract has market value.

If an option expires unexercised, the holder no longer has any of the rights granted in the contract. In addition, the holder loses the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/premium.asp">premium</a> they paid for the option, along with any commissions and fees related to its purchase.
