Energy Risk Professional (ERP) is a professional designation awarded by the Global Association of Risk Professionals (GARP) to individuals who work in the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/investing/oil-gas-industry-overview/" rel="noopener noreferrer">oil</a>, coal, natural gas, and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/investing/top-alternative-energy-companies/" rel="noopener noreferrer">alternative energy</a> industries. As of 2021, the designation will no longer be offered.

People seeking this designation must complete a rigorous self-study program, pass a 180-question, eight-hour exam, have at least two years of qualifying work experience, and agree to the Global Association of Risk Professionals' professional code of conduct.

Successful applicants earn the right to use the Energy Risk Professional (ERP) designation with their names, which can improve job opportunities, professional reputation, and pay. The Energy Risk Professional (ERP) program is developed by seasoned energy professionals to teach applicants about real-world scenarios.

GARP announced in 2020 that 2021 will be the last year the ERP exam will be offered as interest in the ERP designation has decreased, according to a study by the organization. As a result, it will no longer be possible to obtain an Energy Risk Professional (ERP) designation.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿

The study program to become an Energy Risk Professional (ERP) covers physical energy markets, financial trading instruments, valuation and structuring of energy transactions, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskmanagement.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">risk management</a> in financial trading, financial disclosure, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accounting.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">accounting</a>, and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/compliancedepartment.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">compliance</a>.
