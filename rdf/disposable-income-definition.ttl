Disposable income, also known as disposable personal income (DPI), is the amount of money that an individual or household has to spend or save after <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incometax.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">income taxes</a> have been deducted.

At the macro level, disposable personal income is closely monitored as one of the key economic indicators used to gauge the overall state of the economy.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿﻿

A number of statistical measures and economic indicators derive from disposable income. For example, economists use disposable income as a starting point to calculate metrics such as <a class="pseudoStyle" data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/discretionaryincome.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">discretionary income</a>, personal savings rates, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marginalpropensitytoconsume.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">marginal propensity to consume (MPC)</a>, and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marginal-propensity-save.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">marginal propensity to save (MPS)</a>. Here's what these metrics indicate:

The federal government uses a slightly different method to calculate disposable income for <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/garnishment.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">wage garnishment</a> purposes. This is the seizure of a portion of a wage earner's paycheck before it is paid on every payday until the amount due for back taxes or overdue child support is repaid.

For this purpose, the government uses disposable income as a starting point to determine how much of each paycheck to seize. The amount garnished may not exceed 25% of a person's disposable income or the amount by which a person's weekly income exceeds 30 times the federal minimum wage, whichever is less.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿﻿ The amount paid into a gross income retirement plan also is deducted from disposable income in this calculation.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿﻿
