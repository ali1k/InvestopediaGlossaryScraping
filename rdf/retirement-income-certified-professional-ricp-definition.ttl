The term Retirement Income Certified Professional (RICP) refers to a financial professional who specializes in <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/retirement-planning.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">retirement income planning</a>. Financial professionals earn the RICP designation after following the program for <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/retirement.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">retirement</a> income professionals. Once qualified, RICPs advise retirees and near-retirees as to the best way to use the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">assets</a> they have accumulated for retirement to live comfortably within a realistic budget and not run out of money prematurely.

According to its website, the American College of Financial Services gives financial professionals access to the education they need to achieve their career goals. Financial programs range from the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/clu.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">chartered life underwriter</a> (CLU) <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurance.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">insurance</a> specialty program—the first financial designation program offered by the school since 1927—to the more recent RICP.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2">﻿</span>﻿

The <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/not-for-profit.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">not-for-profit</a> college located in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, created the RICP designation to serve the financial planning needs of America’s increasing population of retirees and near-retirees. The knowledge required to accumulate retirement <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/savings.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">savings</a> and the ability to use that savings to generate a comfortable and lasting income in retirement is considered two separate traits.

The RICP is designed for financial professionals who already have a broad-based financial planning credential, such as <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/chartered-financial-consultant-chfc.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">chartered financial consultant</a>, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cfp.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">certified financial planner</a>, or CLU, or whose businesses already emphasize retirement income planning. Applicants must have three years of business experience in order to be considered for the program.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿ According to the website, an undergraduate or graduate degree is the equivalent of one year's worth of experience.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿

Designed as a self-study program, the RICP curriculum consists of three online courses that students must complete. They are as follows:

The program provides students with a series of best practices ranging from topics such as <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/socialsecurity.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Social Security</a>, risks in retirement financial planning, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/medicare.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Medicare</a> and other <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/healthinsurance.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">health insurance</a> options, long-term care needs, as well as tax and estate planning.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿ These arm RICPs with the tools they need to help their clients maintain their customary standard of living throughout retirement, address income gaps, create an <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="4" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/estateplanning.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">estate plan</a>, and limit risk.

Students must pass a closed-book 100-question exam at the end of each course. RICPs must adhere to a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/code-of-ethics.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">code of ethics</a> and reporting requirements. Individuals with the RICP designation must also update their credentials with 15 hours of continuing education that they must complete every two years.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿

While many financial professionals are experienced in advising and helping individuals to accumulate retirement <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">assets</a>, the increasing number of retirees means there is a large demand for expertise in how to manage and use those assets.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿ But fewer advisers have expertise in subjects such as how to determine the following:

The RICP program aims to fill the gap in the financial <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/industry.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">industry</a>.
