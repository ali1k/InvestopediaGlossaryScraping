The glass ceiling is a metaphor referring to an invisible barrier that prevents women and minorities from being promoted to managerial- and executive-level positions within an organization. The phrase “glass ceiling” is used to describe the difficulties faced by women when trying to move to higher roles in a male-dominated hierarchy.

The barriers are most often unwritten, meaning that women are more likely to be restricted from advancing through accepted norms and implicit biases rather than defined corporate policies.

The glass ceiling concept was first popularized in a 1986 <em>Wall Street Journal</em> article discussing the corporate hierarchy and how invisible barriers seemed to be preventing women from advancing in their careers past a certain level. In 2015, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> itself reported (quoting Gay Bryant, former editor of <em>Working Woman </em>magazine) that the concept goes back to the 1970s and may have originated with two women at Hewlett-Packard.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2">﻿</span>﻿ In more recent years, the analysis of the glass ceiling has expanded to include issues preventing not only women from moving up but also minorities.

The equality gap varies from country to country, and in some cases, it is driven by cultural stances against women participating in the workforce. In the United States, companies have responded to the equality gap by focusing on <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/best-programs-improving-diversity-and-inclusion-in-financial-services-industry-5092350" rel="noopener noreferrer">measures to increase diversity</a>. This has included hiring personnel specifically tasked with ensuring that women and minorities see improved representation in management-level positions. By focusing on policies that reduce or eliminate the glass ceiling, companies can ensure that the most qualified candidates hold decision-making positions.

At the end of 2020, women accounted for 55.9% of the labor force in the U.S.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9">﻿</span>﻿ But when it came to chief executive positions, women held only 29.9% of these roles, and 88% of chief executives identified as white, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿

In response to the growing concern over barriers preventing women and minorities from advancing, the U.S. Department of Labor launched the Glass Ceiling Commission in 1991. It was charged with identifying the types of barriers that exist and policies that companies had undertaken or could undertake to increase diversity at managerial and executive levels.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿

The commission found that qualified women and minorities were being denied the opportunity to compete for or win decision-making positions. It also found that the perceptions of both employees and employers often included stereotypes that held women and minorities in a negative light.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿

When Hillary Clinton ran for president in 2008 and 2016, she repeatedly spoke of her goal of shattering the “highest, hardest glass ceiling” by becoming America’s first female president.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8">﻿</span>﻿ <span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7">﻿</span>﻿ Vice President Kamala Harris shattered the second-highest glass ceiling in the U.S. when she became the first female and first Black vice president on January 20, 2021. She <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/5-things-you-need-to-know-about-kamala-harris-5077701" rel="noopener noreferrer">was also the first</a> woman and first Black and South Asian attorney general of California, as well as the first Black woman to be elected district attorney of San Francisco.

This isn’t the first glass ceiling Yellen has broken either. She also served as the first woman to head the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalreservesystem.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Federal Reserve</a>, a role she held during President Barack Obama’s administration.

The glass cliff is a closely related term, but refers to a phenomenon wherein women tend to be promoted to positions of power during times of crises, when failure is more likely. This could occur in fields as diverse as finance, politics, technology, and academia. While the more common glass ceiling presents a barrier to reaching the highest executive levels within their respective organizations, the glass cliff addresses the tendency to place women who have broken through that glass ceiling into precarious positions, making it likely their performance will falter, as if they are at risk of falling off a cliff.

Had Hillary Clinton won the presidential election in 2008, at the height of the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/great-recession.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Great Recession</a>, she might have been seen as the victim of the “<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/glass-cliff.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">glass cliff</a>.” The term was coined by professors Michelle K. Ryan and Alexander Haslam of the University of Exeter, United Kingdom, in 2004. Ryan and Haslam documented this phenomenon extensively in a study of Great Britain’s FTSE 100 companies.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6">﻿</span>﻿
