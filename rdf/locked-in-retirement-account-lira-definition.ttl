A Locked-in Retirement Account (LIRA) is a type of registered pension fund in Canada that does not permit withdrawals before retirement except in exceptional circumstances. The locked-in retirement account is designed to hold pension funds for a former plan member, an ex-spouse, or a surviving spouse.

Cash withdrawals are not permitted while the funds are locked in. Pension funds that are transferred to a LIRA can be used to purchase a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lifeannuity.asp">life annuity</a> or can be transferred to a life income fund (LIF) or a locked-in retirement income fund (LRIF).

Once the fund's beneficiary reaches retirement age, the life annuity, LIF, or LRIF provide a pension for life.

A LIRA may be created to hold funds that are transferred from a pension plan for a variety of reasons. The beneficiary may have left the job. The fund may be split with a divorced spouse, or the beneficiary may have died, leaving the fund to an heir.

A Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) can be cashed in at the owner's discretion. The LIRA does not have such an option.

According to the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" href="https://www.rrq.gouv.qc.ca/en/retraite/cri_frv/Pages/cri.aspx">Quebec government website</a>:

LIRA plans are governed by federal or provincial pension legislation. Depending on the province in which the plan owner lives, there are different rules on how to unlock locked-in pension funds. Every locked-in pension must comply with the legislation of a specific province or the federal legislation.

Various allowable reasons for unlocking a LIRA include low Income, potential <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreclosure.asp">foreclosure</a>, eviction from a rental, first month’s rent and security deposit, high medical or disability costs, shortened life expectancy, and permanent departure from Canada.

Unlocking 50% of a LIRA can be done one time if you are 55 years old or older in some provinces and federally. Small balance unlocking is allowed if the balance is under a certain amount.

It's best to consult a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-advisor.asp">financial advisor</a> if the amounts involved are substantial.
