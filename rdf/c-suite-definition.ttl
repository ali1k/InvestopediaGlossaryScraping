C-suite, or C-level, is widely-used vernacular describing a cluster of a corporation's most important senior executives. C-suite gets its name from the titles of top senior executives, which tend to start with the letter C, for "chief," as in chief executive officer (<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/ceo.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">CEO</a>), chief financial officer (<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cfo.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">CFO</a>), chief operating officer (<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coo.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">COO</a>), and chief information officer (<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="4" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cio.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">CIO</a>).

The C-suite is deemed the most important and influential group of individuals within a company. Reaching this high echelon typically requires a plethora of experience and finely-honed leadership skills. While many C-level executives formerly relied on functional know-how and technical skills to climb the lower rungs of the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corporate-ladder.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">corporate ladder</a>, most have cultivated more visionary perspectives needed to make sound upper management decisions.

Most frequently the CEO, CFO, and COO positions come to mind when talking about the C-suite. However, there are several other positions that fall into this executive level. Other C-Suite officers include:

The number of C-level positions varies, depending on variables such as a company's size, mission, and sector. While larger companies may require both a CHRM and a COO, smaller operations may only need a COO to oversee human resources activities.

Invariably the highest-level corporate executive, the CEO traditionally serves as the face of the company and frequently consults other C-suite members for advice on major decisions. CEOs can come from any career background, as long as they have cultivated substantial leadership and decision-making skills along their career paths.

In the financial industry, the CFO position represents the top of the corporate ladder for financial analysts and accountants striving for upward mobility. Portfolio management, accounting, investment research, and financial analysis are the prime skills that CFOs must possess. CFOs have global mindsets and work closely with CEOs to source new business opportunities while weighing the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financialrisk.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">financial risks</a> and benefits of each potential venture.

A leader in information technology, the CIO usually gets his or her start as a business analyst, then works towards C-level glory, while developing technical skills in disciplines such as programming, coding, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/project-management.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">project management</a>, and mapping. CIOs are usually skilled at applying these functional skills to risk management, business strategy, and finance activities. In many companies, CIOs are referred to as the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/chief-technology-officer.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">chief technology officers</a>.

As the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/humanresources.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">human resources</a> (HR) C-level executive, the COO ensures a company's operations run smoothly. They focus is in areas such as recruitment, training, payroll, legal, and administrative services. The COO is usually second in command to the CEO.

The CMO typically works its way up to the C-suite from sales or marketing roles. These execs are skilled at managing social innovation and product development initiatives across both brick-and-mortar establishments and electronic platforms—the latter of which is highly essential in today's digital era.

A <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/chief-technology-officer.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">chief technology officer</a> (CTO) is the executive in charge of an organization's technological needs as well as its <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/randd.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">research and development</a> (R&amp;D). Also known as a chief technical officer, this individual examines the short- and long-term needs of an organization and utilizes capital to make investments designed to help the organization reach its objectives. The CTO usually reports directly to the chief executive officer (CEO) of the firm.

C-level members work in concert to ensure a company’s strategies and operations align with their established plans and policies. With public companies, activities that don't lean toward increased profits for shareholders are routinely corrected, under the purview of C-level management personnel.

C-suite execs occupy stressful high-stakes positions and are thus rewarded with high compensation packages.

The C-suite refers to a company's top management positions, where the "C" stands for "chief." Various chief ____ officers (e.g., CEO, CIO, CFO, etc.) are the occupants of the C-suite. These individuals, while highly-paid and influential managers, are still employees of the firm. The number of C-level positions varies by firm, depending on variables such as a company's size, mission, and sector. 

Yes. Historically, only men occupied top management positions in firms. Over the past few decades, this has changed a bit. Still, a 2020 Oliver Wyman report found that women hold only 20% of executive committee positions and 23% of board seats. Among Fortune 1000 companies, 94% of chief executive officers are male, and just 6% employed are female CEOs.

There isn’t a standard road map for reaching the C-suite. For some, being proactive and thoughtful about formulating your career path will be essential, while others may get by simply through being aggressive and rubbing elbows with the right people. In any case, hard work and a skilled track record are a must, and there’s no room for complacency. Having proper credentials such as an MBA from a top business school is also a plus.
