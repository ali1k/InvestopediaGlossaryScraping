Married filing jointly refers to a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/filingstatus.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">filing status</a> for married couples that have wed before the end of the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxyear.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">tax year</a>. When filing taxes under married filing jointly status, a married couple can record their respective incomes, deductions, credits, and exemptions on the same tax return.

Married filing jointly is often best if only one spouse has a significant income. However, if both spouses work and the income and itemized deductions are large and very unequal, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/tax/08/file-seperately.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">it may be more advantageous to file separately</a>.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿﻿

When using married filing jointly filing status, both spouses are equally responsible for the return and the taxes. If either one of the spouses understates the taxes due, both are equally liable for the penalties, unless the other spouse is shown to be unaware of the mistake and did not benefit from it. Taxes can get pretty technical and tricky, so if a couple is having trouble determining tax liability, talk to an experienced tax preparer.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2">﻿</span>﻿﻿

When using married filing jointly status, your total combined tax liability is often lower than the sum of your and your spouse’s individual tax liabilities if you were <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mfs.asp">filing separately</a>. This is because the standard deduction may be higher, and married filing jointly status may qualify for other tax benefits that don’t apply to the other filing statuses. (Watch the video for some specifics on these potential benefits.)<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5">﻿</span>﻿

A joint tax return will often provide a bigger tax refund or a lower tax liability. However, this is not always the case. A couple may want to investigate their options by calculating the refund or balance due for filing jointly and separately and use the one that provides the biggest refund or the lowest tax liability.

You can use the married filing jointly status if both of the following statements are true:

Also, if you were not divorced or legally separated on Dec. 31, you are considered unmarried if all of the following apply:<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4">﻿</span>﻿
