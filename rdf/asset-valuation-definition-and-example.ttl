Asset valuation is the process of determining the fair market or <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/presentvalue.asp">present value</a> of assets, using <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bookvalue.asp">book values</a>, absolute valuation models like discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models or comparables. Such assets include investments in marketable securities such as stocks, bonds and options; <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tangibleasset.asp">tangible assets</a> like buildings and equipment; or <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="4" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intangibleasset.asp">intangible assets</a> such as brands, patents and trademarks.

Asset valuation plays a key role in finance and often consists of both subjective and objective measurements. The value of a company's fixed assets – which are also known as <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalasset.asp">capital assets</a> or <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/ppe.asp">property plant and equipment</a> – are straightforward to value, based on their book values and replacement costs. However, there's no number on the financial statements that tell investors exactly how much a company's brand and intellectual property are worth. Companies can overvalue goodwill in an <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/acquisition.asp">acquisition</a> as the valuation of intangible assets is subjective and can be difficult to measure.

The net asset value – also known as <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nettangibleassets.asp">net tangible assets</a> – is the book value of tangible assets on the balance sheet (their historical cost minus the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accumulated-depreciation.asp">accumulated depreciation</a>) less intangible assets and liabilities – or the money that would be left over if the company was liquidated. This is the minimum a company is worth and can provide a useful floor for a company's asset value because it excludes intangible assets. A stock would be considered undervalued if its market value were below <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bookvalue.asp">book value</a>, which means the stock is trading at a deep discount to book value per share.

However, the market value for an asset is likely to differ significantly from book value – or <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholdersequity.asp">shareholders’ equity</a> – which is based on historical cost. And some companies’ greatest value is in their intangible assets, like the findings of a biomedical research company.

Absolute value models value assets based only on the characteristics of that asset. These models are known as <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp">discounted cash flow</a> (DCF) models, and value assets like stocks, bonds and real estate, based on their future cash flows and the opportunity cost of capital. They include:

Relative valuation models determine the value based on the observation of market prices of similar assets. For example, one way of determining the value of a property is to compare it with similar properties in the same area. Likewise, investors use the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pricemultiples.asp">price multiples</a> comparable public companies trade at to get an idea of relative market valuations. Stocks are often valued based on comparable valuation metrics such as the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-earningsratio.asp">price-to-earnings ratio</a> (P/E ratio), <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-to-bookratio.asp">price-to-book ratio</a> or the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="4" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-to-cash-flowratio.asp">price-to-cash flow ratio</a>.

This method is also used to value illiquid assets like private companies with no market price. Venture capitalists refer to valuing a company's stock before it goes public as <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/premoneyvaluation.asp">pre-money valuation</a>. By looking at the amounts paid for similar companies in past transactions, investors get an indication of an unlisted company's potential value. This is called <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/precedent-transaction-analysis.asp">precedent transaction analysis</a>.

Let’s work out net asset value for Alphabet Inc. (<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=goog">GOOG</a>), the parent company of search engine and advertising giant Google.

All figures are for the period ending Dec. 31, 2018.

Total net asset value: <strong>$175.4 billion</strong> (total assets $232.8 billion – total intangible assets $2.2 billion – total liabilities $55.2 billion)
