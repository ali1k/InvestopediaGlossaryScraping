A depression is a severe and prolonged downturn in <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economic-conditions.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">economic</a> activity. In <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economics.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">economics</a>, a depression is commonly defined as an extreme <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/recession.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">recession</a><strong> </strong>that lasts three or more years or which leads to a decline in real <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="4" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gdp.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">gross domestic product (GDP)</a> of at least 10%. in a given year. Depressions are relatively less frequent than milder recessions, and tend to be accompanied by high unemployment and low inflation.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿﻿

In times of depression, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cci.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">consumer confidence</a> and investments decrease, causing the economy to shut down. Economic factors that characterize a depression include:

<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economist.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Economists</a> disagree on the duration of depressions. Some believe a depression encompasses only the period plagued by declining economic activity. Other economists argue that the depression continues up until the point that most economic activity has returned to normal.

A recession is a normal part of the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/businesscycle.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">business cycle</a> that generally occurs when<strong> </strong>GDP contracts for at least two <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quarter.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">quarters</a>. A depression, on the other hand, is an extreme fall in economic activity that lasts for years, rather than just several quarters. This makes recessions much more common: since 1854, there have been 33 recessions in the U.S. and just one depression.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2">﻿</span>﻿ Moreover, a recession is marked by economists as two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth, even if those periods of contraction are relatively mild. A depression, on the other hand, is marked by a drop in a year's GDP over 10% or more.

The <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/great_depression.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Great Depression</a> lasted roughly a decade and is widely considered to be the worst economic downturn in the history of the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/industrialization.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">industrialized</a> world. It began shortly after the Oct. 24, 1929, U.S. <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock-market-crash.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">stock market crash</a> known as <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="4" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blackthursday.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Thursday</a>. After years of reckless investing and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="5" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/speculation.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">speculation</a> the stock market <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="6" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bubble.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">bubble</a> burst and a huge <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="7" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sell-off.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">sell-off</a> began, with a record 12.9 million <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="8" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volumeoftrade.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">shares traded</a>.﻿

The United States was already in a recession, and the following Tuesday, on Oct. 29, 1929, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 12% in another mass sell-off, triggering the start of the Great Depression.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4">﻿</span>﻿﻿

Although the Great Depression began in the United States, the economic impact was felt worldwide for more than a decade. The Great Depression was characterized by a drop in <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumer-spending.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">consumer spending</a> and investment, and by catastrophic unemployment, poverty, hunger, and political unrest. In the U.S., unemployment climbed to nearly 25% in 1933, remaining in the double-digits until 1941, when it finally receded to 9.66%.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5">﻿</span>﻿﻿

Shortly after Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected president in 1932, the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fdic.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)</a> was created to protect depositors' accounts.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10">﻿</span>﻿ In addition, the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</a> was formed to regulate the U.S. stock markets. 

Policymakers appear to have learned their lesson from the Great Depression. New laws and regulations were introduced to prevent a repeat and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/centralbank.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">central banks</a> were forced to rethink how best to go about tackling economic stagnation.

Nowadays, central banks are quicker to react to <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">inflation</a> and are more willing to use <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expansionary_policy.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">expansionary monetary policy</a> to lift the economy during difficult times. Using these tools helped to stop the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/great-recession.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">great recession</a> of the late 2000s from becoming a full-blown depression.

A series of factors can cause an economy and production to contract severely. In the case of the Great Depression, questionable <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monetarypolicy.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">monetary policy</a> took the blame.

After the stock market crashed in 1929, the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/08/federal-reserve.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Federal Reserve</a> (Fed) continued to hike <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">interest rates</a>—defending the<strong> </strong><a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/09/gold-standard.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">gold standard</a> took priority over pumping money into the economy to encourage spending.<strong><span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12">﻿</span>﻿﻿ </strong>Those actions triggered massive <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="4" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deflation.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">deflation</a>. Prices declined by about 10% each year and consumers, mindful that the prices for goods and services would continue to fall, refrained from making purchases.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11">﻿</span>﻿﻿
