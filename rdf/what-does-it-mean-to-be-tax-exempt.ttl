Tax-exempt refers to income or transactions that are free from tax at the federal, state, or local level. The reporting of tax-free items may be on a taxpayer's individual or business tax return and shown for informational purposes only. The tax-exempt article is not part of any tax calculations.

Tax-exempt may also refer to the status of a business or organization which has limits on the amount of income or gifts which are taxable. These organizations include religious and charitable institutions.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿

Not to be confused with a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tax-deduction.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">tax deduction</a>, tax-exempt frees the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxpayer.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">taxpayer</a> of any tax obligation to submit taxes on the tax-free transaction or income. Whereas, the use of a tax deduction is to reduce the tax obligation by lowering <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/grossincome.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">gross income</a>.

One common type of tax-exempt income is interest earned on <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/municipalbond.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">municipal bonds</a>, which are bonds issued by states and cities to raise funds for general operations or a specific project. When a taxpayer makes interest income on municipal bonds issued in their state of residence, the profit is exempt from both federal and state taxes.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2">﻿</span>﻿

 Taxpayers receive IRS Form <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/form-1099-int.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">1099-INT</a> for any investment interest they earn during the tax year. The reporting of tax-exempt interest is in box 8 of the 1099 form.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿ This informational only data are not included in the calculation of personal income taxes.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2">﻿</span>﻿

A taxpayer may buy an asset and subsequently sell that asset for a profit. The profit is a capital gain, which creates a taxable event. <span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4">﻿</span>﻿ However, several types of capital gains are exempt from taxation. 

A taxpayer can offset <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/tax/09/tax-effects-capital-gains.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">capital gains</a> with other <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalloss.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">capital losses</a> for the tax year. For example, an investor with $5,000 in profits and $3,000 in losses pays taxes on only $2,000 in capital gains. The amount of capital losses a taxpayer may claim in a given year has a cap of $3,000. When capital losses exceed this cap, the excess may be carried forward to offset gains in future years.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4">﻿</span>﻿ 

The tax code also allows taxpayers to exclude from federal taxes a specific portion of capital gains from the sale of a home.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5">﻿</span>﻿

The <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/alternativeminimumtax.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">alternative minimum tax</a> (AMT) is an alternative method for determining tax liability. AMT adds back specific tax-exempt items into the personal tax calculation.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6">﻿</span>﻿ Interest from private activity bonds exempt from regular tax, for example, is added to the AMT tax calculation.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7">﻿</span>﻿ Individual taxpayers must include the AMT calculation with their original tax return and pay tax on the higher tax liability.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6">﻿</span>﻿

An exempt organization that has $1,000 or more of gross income from an unrelated business must file Form 990-T. An organization must pay estimated tax if it expects its tax for the year to be $500 or more.

A <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/501c3-organizations.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">501(c)(3)</a> nonprofit corporation is a charitable organization that the IRS recognizes as tax-exempt. This type of organization does not pay income tax on its earnings or on the donations it receives. Also, any taxpayer donations may reduce a taxpayer's taxable income by the donation amount.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8">﻿</span>﻿ This incentive encourages private charity and makes it easier for nonprofits to raise money.

A 501(c)(3) is a charitable organization involved in religious, charitable, educational, literary, preventing cruelty to animals and children, fostering amateur local and international sports competition, testing for public safety, and scientific activities or operations.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8">﻿</span>﻿ (For related reading, see "<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0411/5-groups-that-dont-pay-taxes.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 Groups That Don't Pay Taxes</a>")
