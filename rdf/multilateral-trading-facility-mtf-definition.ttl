A multilateral trading facility (MTF) is a European term for a trading system that facilitates the exchange of <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financialinstrument.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">financial instruments</a> between multiple parties.

MTFs allow <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eligible_contract_participant.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">eligible contract participants</a> to gather and transfer a variety of securities, especially instruments that may not have an official market. These facilities are often electronic systems controlled by approved market operators or larger <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investmentbank.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">investment banks</a>. Traders usually submit orders electronically, where a matching software engine pairs buyers with sellers.

MTFs provide <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/retailinvestor.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">retail investors</a> and investment firms with an alternative to traditional exchanges. Before their introduction, investors had to rely on national securities exchanges such as <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/euronext.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Euronext</a> or the London Stock Exchange (LSE).

MTFs have fewer restrictions surrounding the admittance of financial instruments for trading, allowing participants to exchange more exotic assets and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otc.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">over-the-counter</a> (OTC) products. For example, the LMAX Exchange offers spot foreign exchange and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/preciousmetal.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">precious metals</a> trading.

Faster transaction speeds, lower costs and trading incentives have helped MTFs become increasingly popular in Europe, although the NASDAQ OMX Europe was closed in 2010 as MTFs face intense competition with each other and established <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exchange.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">exchanges</a>.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿ The introduction of MTFs has led to greater fragmentation in the financial markets since single securities may now list across multiple venues. Brokers responded by offering smart order routing (SOR) and other strategies to secure the best price between these many venues.

MTFs operate under the European Union’s (EU's) <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mifid-ii.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">MiFID II</a> regulatory environment—a revised legislative framework designed to protect investors and instill confidence in the financial industry.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2">﻿</span>﻿

In the United States, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/alternative-trading-system.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alternative Trading Systems</a> (ATS) operate similarly to MTFs. ATS are regulated as broker-dealers rather than exchanges in most cases, but must still be approved by the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) and meet certain restrictions.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿

In recent years, the SEC has intensified its enforcement activities surrounding ATS in a move that could lead to stricter MTF regulation in Europe. This is especially true for <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dark-pool.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">dark pools</a> and other ATS that are relatively obscure and difficult to trade and value.

The most widely known ATS in the United States are <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ecn.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Electronic Communication Networks</a> (ECNs)—computerized systems that automatically match buy and sell orders for securities in the market.

Investment banks and financial data companies can leverage <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economiesofscale.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">economies of scale</a> to compete with traditional securities exchanges and potentially realize synergies with their existing trading operations.

Some investment banks, which already ran internal crossing systems, have also converted their internal systems into MTFs. For example, UBS Group established its own MTF that works in conjunction with its internal crossing systems.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4">﻿</span>﻿

In 2019, financial data and media company Bloomberg announced that it received authorization from the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM) to operate an MTF from Amsterdam throughout the EU.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5">﻿</span>﻿ Bloomberg’s MTF provides quote and trading functionality to eligible participants in products such as cash bonds, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/repurchaseagreement.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">repos</a>, credit default swaps (CDS), interest rate securities (IRS), <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">exchange-traded funds</a> (ETF), equity derivatives, and forex (FX) derivatives.
