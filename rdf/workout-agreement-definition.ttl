A workout agreement is a contract mutually agreed to between a lender and borrower to renegotiate the terms on a loan that is in <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/default2.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">default</a>, often in the case of a mortgage that is in <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/arrears.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">arrears</a>. Generally, the workout includes waiving any existing defaults and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/restructuring.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">restructuring</a> the loan’s terms and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="4" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/covenant.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">covenants</a>.

A workout agreement is only possible if it serves the interests of both the borrower and the lender.

A mortgage workout agreement is intended to help a borrower avoid <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreclosure.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">foreclosure</a>, the process by which the lender assumes control of a property from the homeowner due to a lack of payment as stipulated in the mortgage agreement. At the same time, it helps the lender recoup some of their funds that would otherwise be lost in the process.

The renegotiated terms will generally provide some measure of relief to the borrower by reducing the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtservice.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">debt-servicing</a> burden through accommodative measures provided by the lender. Examples of relief can include <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/091615/difference-between-restructuring-and-refinancing.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">extending the term</a> of the loan or rescheduling payments. While the benefits to the borrower of a workout agreement are obvious, the advantage to the lender is that it avoids the expense and trouble of payment recovery efforts, such as foreclosure for workouts in real estate <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/09/fighting-collection-lawsuits.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">or a collection lawsuit</a>.

Other types of workout agreements can involve different kinds of loans and even involve <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidate.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">liquidation</a> scenarios. A business that becomes insolvent and cannot meet its debt obligations may seek an arrangement to appease creditors and shareholders.

For borrowers, general best practices to consider when negotiating, or thinking about negotiating, a workout agreement with a lender include the following:
