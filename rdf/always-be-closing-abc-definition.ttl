Always Be Closing (ABC) is a motivational phrase used to describe a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sale.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">sales strategy</a>. It implies that a salesperson following the regimen should continuously look for new <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sales-lead.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">prospects</a>, pitch products or services to those prospects, and ultimately complete a sale.

As a strategy, ABC requires that the salesperson be persistent, but also that they know when to cut their losses and move on to another prospect.

The phrase Always Be Closing was popularized in the 1992 film, "Glengarry Glen Ross" starring Alec Baldwin, Al Pacino, and Jack Lemmon. The movie was written by David Mamet and was based on his Pulitzer Prize-winning play. It emphasized the darker, cutthroat side of the sales industry.

In the film, an aggressive representative from the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corporation.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">corporate office</a> is brought in to motivate a group of real estate agents, telling them to sell more property or be fired if they fail. He delivers a profanity-laced tirade, accusing the salespeople of being timid and unmotivated. He flaunts his wealth and success.

During his speech, he flips over a blackboard on which the words "Always Be Closing" are written, and he repeats the phrase several times. The speech backfires, however, because the salespeople resort to a host of unethical tactics to achieve their sales numbers.

Later, in the 2000 film "Boiler Room," a sales trainer mentoring a young <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financialcareers/08/becoming-a-stockbroker.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">stockbroker</a> asks the trainee if he's seen "Glengarry Glen Ross." He then proceeds to quiz him on the meaning of Always Be Closing.

The term has become a catchall example of a few of the pithy quotations that sales managers often use to motivate their sales staffs and to drive home the importance of being tenacious with prospects. It serves as a reminder that every action a salesperson takes with a client prospect should be done with the intention of moving the sale toward a close.

From the initial rapport-building stage of the sales process to uncovering customer needs and product positioning, the representative should be "closing" the entire time, setting the customer up to to a point where the only logical thing to do is pull out his checkbook.

While it might be entertaining on the big screen, ABC is seldom successful in real life situations for a variety of reasons.

A 2018 study by CSO Insights, an independent research and data provider, indicated that successful salespeople spent, at most, 35% of their time actually selling or "closing" deals.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿ The research found that lead generation, customer follow-up, strategy and planning sessions, and administrative tasks comprised the lion's share of their time.

As InvestementNews.com reports, research suggests that the ABC mentality is losing its effectiveness.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2">﻿</span>﻿ The average 21st-century customer comes armed with significantly more information than a consumer did in 1984, when the David Mamet story was a Pulitzer Prize-winning stage presentation, and even since 1992, when the film was released. Modern customers prefer to shop around and research before making purchases. They're much less susceptible to slick sales pitches than people once were.
