A tax deduction is a deduction that lowers a person or organization's tax liability by lowering their <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxableincome.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">taxable income</a>. Deductions are typically expenses that the taxpayer incurs during the year that can be applied against or subtracted from their <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxliability.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">gross income</a> in order to figure out how much tax is owed. 

Different regions have different tax codes that allow taxpayers to deduct a variety of expenses from taxable income. Tax codes vary at the federal and state level. One form might be <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/form-2106-ez.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">2106-EZ</a>, but that might not apply in some places.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2">﻿</span>﻿

Taxation authorities in both the federal and state governments set the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tax-code.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">tax code</a> standards annually. Tax deductions set by government authorities are often used to entice taxpayers to participate in community service programs for the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/betterment-review-4587887" rel="noopener noreferrer">betterment</a> of society. Taxpayers who are aware of eligible federal and state tax deductions can greatly benefit through both tax deduction and service-oriented activities annually. In the United States, tax deductions are available for federal and state taxes.

An example of a tax deduction is a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/realizedloss.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">realized capital loss</a> on a stock, which can be <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/100515/heres-how-deduct-your-stock-losses-your-tax-bill.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">deducted from your overall income tax bill</a> so long as the shares sold were owned for investment purposes.

Tax deductions fall under two categories: standard deductions and itemized deductions. 

In the United States, a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standarddeduction.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">standard deduction</a> is given on federal taxes for most individuals. The amount of the federal standard deduction varies by year and is based on the taxpayer's filing characteristics.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4">﻿</span>﻿ Each state sets its own tax law on standard deductions, with most states also offering a standard deduction at the state tax level. Taxpayers have the option to take a standard deduction or to <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/itemizeddeduction.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">itemize deductions</a>. If a taxpayer chooses to itemize deductions, then deductions are only taken for any amount above the standard deduction limit.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5">﻿</span>﻿

Standard deductions are often the easiest route to choose because there is no need to make a calculation—the amount is already set and determined. Itemized deductions require some calculation and work on the part of the tax filer. If you're <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mfj.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">married and are filing jointly</a>, have several major expenses like a home, major medical expenses, and put money into a retirement fund, then you may benefit from going through the itemized deductions route. According to the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irs.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Internal Revenue Service</a> (IRS), the following expenses qualify under the itemized deductions category﻿:

There are a number of common tax deductions and also many overlooked tax deductions at the federal and state tax level that taxpayers can utilize to lower their taxable income. Common tax deductions include <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/charitabledonation.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">charitable donations</a> to nonprofit, religious, humanitarian, or governmental organizations.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8">﻿</span>﻿

Some uncommon tax deductions include sales tax on personal property purchases and annual tax on personal property, such as a vehicle.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9">﻿</span>﻿ Many expenses incurred throughout the year for business reasons may also be eligible for itemized deductions, such as networking expenses, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/travelexpenses.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">travel expenses</a>, and some <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/transportationexpenses.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">transportation expenses</a>.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10">﻿</span>﻿

It’s important to keep in mind that there may be certain limitations on what you can deduct each year to reduce your tax obligation to Uncle Sam. The IRS sets a threshold amount for many deductions that you should research before filing.

For example, if you're itemizing healthcare deductions, the threshold for any costs that were not reimbursed during the tax year (and that were paid for yourself, your spouse, and dependents) has to exceed a certain percent of your adjusted gross income or they cannot be deducted. For your 2020 tax return, the threshold for medical expenses is 7.5% of adjusted gross income for all <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxpayer.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">taxpayers</a>.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11">﻿</span>﻿ Your <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accountant.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">accountant</a> will be aware of these and any other thresholds, so if you’re using a tax professional, there should be no need to worry. 

One additional type of deduction not included in the standard or itemized tax deductions is the deduction for <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalloss.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">capital losses</a>. A tax loss carryforward is a legal means of rearranging earnings to the benefit of the taxpayer. Individual or business capital losses can be carried forward from previous years. You can claim up to $3,0000 in capital losses as a tax deduction as of the 2020 tax year (the tax return you'd file in 2021).<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12">﻿</span>﻿
