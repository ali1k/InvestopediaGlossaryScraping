The Additional Child Tax Credit was the refundable portion of the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/childtaxcredit.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Child Tax Credit</a>. It could be claimed by families who owed the IRS less than their qualified Child Tax Credit amount. Since the Child Tax Credit was non-refundable, the Additional Child Tax Credit refunded the unused portion of the Child Tax Credit to the taxpayer. This provision was eliminated from 2018 to 2025 by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA).<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10">﻿</span>﻿

However, under the TCJA, the Child Tax Credit includes some provisions for refundable credits. <span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿ In addition, if signed into law, President Biden’s American Rescue Plan would make credits fully refundable in 2021.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13">﻿</span>﻿

A <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxcredit.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">tax credit</a> is a benefit given to eligible taxpayers to help reduce their <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxliability.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">tax liabilities</a>. If Susan's tax bill is $5,550 but she qualifies for a $2,500 tax credit, she will only have to pay $5,550. Some <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/refundablecredit.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">tax credits are refundable</a>, meaning that if the tax credit amounts to more than what is owed as tax, the individual will receive a refund. If Susan's tax credit is actually $6,050 and is refundable, she will be given a check for $6,050 – $5,550 = $500.

Depending on what tax group a taxpayer falls in, they may be eligible to claim a tax credit. For example, taxpayers with children may qualify for the Child Tax Credit which helps to offset the costs of raising kids.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿

For the 2020 <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxyear.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">tax year</a>, the Child Tax Credit allows an eligible tax filer to reduce their tax liability by up to $2,000 per child. To be eligible for the Child Tax Credit, the child or <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dependent.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">dependent</a> must:

Previously, the Child Tax Credit was <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nonrefundabletaxcredit.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">non-refundable</a>, which means that the credit could reduce a taxpayer’s bill to zero, but any excess from the credit would not be refunded.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿﻿<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4">﻿</span>﻿ Families who wanted to keep the unused portion of the Child Tax Credit were able to go the route of another available tax credit called the Additional Child Tax Credit. The Additional Child Tax Credit was a refundable tax credit that families could qualify for if they already qualified for the non-refundable Child Tax Credit. The Additional Child Tax Credit was ideal for families who owed less than the Child Tax Credit and wanted to receive a refund for the surplus credit.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5">﻿</span>﻿

While the Additional Child Tax Credit was eliminated in 2018 under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), up to $1,400 of the $2,000 Child Tax Credit can be refundable for each qualifying child if certain conditions are met. For example, in order to qualify for any refund, a taxpayer needs to earn more than $2,500 for the tax year. To make a claim for a refund, filers must complete Schedule 8812.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿﻿<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11">﻿</span>﻿

Prior to the TCJA, the IRS allowed families with an annual income of more than $3,000 to claim a refund using the Additional Child Tax Credit. The tax credit depended on how much the taxpayer earned and was calculated by taking 15% of the taxpayer's taxable <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earnedincome.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">earned income</a> over $3,000 up to the maximum amount of the credit, which was then $1,000 per child. The total amount in excess of $3,000 (subject to annual adjustments for inflation) was refundable.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8">﻿</span>﻿

For example, a taxpayer with two dependents qualifies for the Child Tax Credit. Their earned income is $28,000, which means income over $3,000 is $25,000. Since 15% x $25,000 = $3,750 is greater than the maximum credit of $2,000 for two kids, they would have received the full portion of any unused credit. So, if the taxpayer received a $800 Child Tax Credit, they would be refunded a $1,200 Additional Child Tax Credit. However, if the taxable earned income was $12,000 instead, 15% of this amount over $3,000 is 15% x $9,000 = $1,350. Because the refundable portion of the credit cannot exceed 15% of earned income that is above $3,000, the taxpayer would receive a maximum refund of $1,350, not $2,000.

Taxpayers with income below $3,000 were eligible if they had at least three qualifying dependents and paid <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/social-security-tax.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Social Security Tax</a> in excess of the amount of their <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earnedincomecredit.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">earned-income credit</a> for the year.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12">﻿</span>﻿
