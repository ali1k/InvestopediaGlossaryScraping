A lender is an individual, a public or private group, or a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financialinstitution.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">financial institution</a> that makes funds available to a person or business with the expectation that the funds will be repaid. Repayment will include the payment of any interest or fees.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿ <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/repayment.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Repayment</a> may occur in increments, as in a monthly mortgage payment (one of the largest loans consumers take out is a mortgage) or as a lump sum.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2">﻿</span>﻿

Lenders may provide funds for a variety of reasons, such as a home mortgage, an automobile loan, or a small business loan. The terms of the loan specify how it must be satisfied, its period, and the consequences of missing payments and default. Ultimately, a lender may go to a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/collectionagency.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">collection agency</a> to recover any funds that are past due.

Qualifying for a loan depends largely on the borrower’s <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-history.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">credit history</a>. The lender examines the borrower’s <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditreport.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">credit report</a>, which details the names of other lenders extending credit, what types of credit are extended, the borrower’s repayment history, and more. The report helps the lender determine whether the borrower is comfortable managing payments based on current employment and income. Lenders may also use the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/ficoscore.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) score</a> in the borrower’s credit report to determine creditworthiness and help make a lending decision.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4">﻿</span>﻿

<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/110614/what-difference-between-secured-and-unsecured-debts.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">When applying for a secured loan</a>, such as an auto loan or a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/heloc/" rel="noopener noreferrer">home equity line of credit (HELOC)</a>, the borrower pledges collateral. An evaluation will be made of the collateral’s value, and the existing debt secured by the collateral is subtracted from its value. The remaining equity affects the lending decision.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4">﻿</span>﻿

The lender evaluates a borrower’s available <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">capital</a>, which includes savings, investments, and other assets that could be used to repay the loan if household income is insufficient. This is helpful in case of a job loss or other financial challenges. The lender may ask what the borrower plans to do with the loan, such as use it to purchase a vehicle or other property. Other factors may also be considered, such as environmental or economic conditions.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4">﻿</span>﻿

Banks, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/041015/what-difference-between-savings-loan-company-and-bank.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">savings and loans</a>, and credit unions <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/091514/expanding-your-small-business-sba-loan.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">may offer Small Business Administration (SBA) programs</a> and must adhere to SBA loan guidelines. Private institutions, angel investors, and venture capitalists lend money based on their own criteria. These lenders will also look at the purpose of the business, the character of the business owner, where the business operates, and the projected annual sales and growth for the business.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5">﻿</span>﻿

Small-business owners prove their ability for loan repayment by providing lenders both personal and business <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancesheet.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">balance sheets</a>. The balance sheets detail assets, liabilities, and the net worth of the business and the individual. Although business owners may propose a repayment plan, the lender has the final say on the terms.
