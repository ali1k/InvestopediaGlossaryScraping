An American depositary receipt (ADR) is a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/negotiable.asp">negotiable</a> certificate issued by a U.S. depositary bank representing a specified number of shares—often one share—of a foreign company's stock. The ADR trades on U.S. stock markets as any domestic shares would.

ADRs offer U.S. investors a way to purchase stock in overseas companies that would not be available otherwise. Foreign firms also benefit, as ADRs enable them to attract American investors and capital without the hassle and expense of listing on U.S. stock exchanges.

ADRs are denominated in U.S. dollars, with the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underlying-security.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">underlying security</a> held by a U.S. financial institution, often by an overseas branch. ADR holders do not have to transact the trade in the foreign currency or worry about exchanging currency on the forex market. These securities are priced and traded in dollars and cleared through U.S. settlement systems.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"></span>

To offer ADRs, a U.S. bank will purchase shares on a foreign exchange. The bank will hold the stock as inventory and issue an ADR for domestic trading. ADRs list on either the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or the Nasdaq, but they are also sold <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otc.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">over-the-counter</a> (OTC).<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"></span>

U.S. banks require that foreign companies provide them with detailed financial information. This requirement makes it easier for American investors to assess a company's financial health.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"></span>

American depositary receipts come in two basic categories:

One primary difference between the two types of ADRs is where investors can buy them. All except the lowest level of sponsored ADRs register with the SEC and trade on major U.S. stock exchanges. Unsponsored ADRs will trade only over-the-counter. Also, unsponsored ADRs never include voting rights.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"></span>

ADRs are additionally categorized into three levels, depending on the extent to which the foreign company has accessed the U.S. markets:

An ADR may represent the underlying shares on a one-for-one basis, a fraction of a share, or multiple shares of the underlying company.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿ The depositary bank will set the ratio of U.S. ADRs per home-country share at a value that they feel will appeal to investors. If an ADR’s value is too high, it could deter some investors. Conversely, if it is too low, investors may think the underlying securities resemble riskier penny stocks.

Because of <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/arbitrage.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">arbitrage</a>, an ADR's price closely tracks that of the company's stock on its home exchange.

Holders of ADRs realize any dividends and capital gains in U.S. dollars. However, dividend payments are net of currency conversion expenses and foreign taxes. Usually, the bank automatically withholds the necessary amount to cover expenses and foreign taxes. Since this is the practice, American investors would need to seek a credit from the IRS or a refund from the foreign government's taxing authority to avoid double taxation on any capital gains realized.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5">﻿</span>﻿

Before American depositary receipts were introduced in the 1920s, American investors who wanted shares of a non-U.S. listed company could only do so on international exchanges—an unrealistic option for the average person back then.

While easier in the contemporary digital age, purchasing shares on international exchanges still has potential drawbacks. One particularly daunting roadblock is currency-exchange issues. Another important drawback is the regulatory differences between U.S. exchanges and foreign exchanges.

Before investing in an internationally traded company, U.S. investors have to familiarize themselves with the different financial authority's regulations, or they could risk misunderstanding important information, such as the company's financials. They might also need to set up a foreign account, as not all domestic brokers can trade internationally.

ADRs were developed because of the complexities involved in buying shares in foreign countries and the difficulties associated with trading at different prices and currency values. J.P. Morgan’s (<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=jpm" rel="noopener noreferrer">JPM</a>) predecessor firm Guaranty Trust Co. pioneered the ADR concept. In 1927, it created and launched the first ADR, enabling U.S. investors to buy shares of famous British retailer Selfridges and helping the luxury depart store tap into global markets. The ADR was listed on the New York Curb Exchange. A few years later, in 1931, the bank introduced the first sponsored ADR for British music company Electrical &amp; Musical Industries (also known as EMI), the eventual home of the Beatles.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2">﻿</span>﻿ Today, J.P. Morgan and another U.S. bank – BNY Mellon – continue to be actively involved in the ADR markets.

Between 1988 and 2018, German car manufacturer Volkswagen AG traded OTC in the U.S. as a sponsored ADR under the ticker VLKAY. In August 2018, Volkswagen terminated its ADR program.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿ The next day, J.P. Morgan established an unsponsored ADR for Volkswagen, now trading under the ticker VWAGY.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4">﻿</span>﻿

Investors who held the old VLKAY ADRs had the option of cashing out, exchanging the ADRs for actual shares of Volkswagen stock—trading on German exchanges—or exchanging them for the new VWAGY ADRs.

Not exactly. ADRs are U.S. dollar-denominated certificates that trade on American stock exchanges and track the price of a foreign company's domestic shares. ADRs represent the prices of those shares, but do not actually grant you ownership rights as common stock typically does. Some ADRs will pay dividends. ADRs may be issued at various ratios, with the most common being 1:1, where each ADR represents one common share of the company.

If an ADR is listed on an exchange you can buy and sell through your broker like any other share. Because of this, and since they are priced in U.S. dollars, ADRs allow American investors a way to diversify their portfolios geographically without having to open overseas accounts or dealing with foreign currency exchange and taxes.

Foreign companies often seek to have their shares traded on U.S. exchanges through ADRs in order to obtain greater visibility in the international market, access to a larger pool of investors, and coverage by more equity analysts. Companies that issue ADRs may also find it easier to raise money in international markets when their ADRs are listed in U.S. markets.

All ADRs are required to have a U.S. investment bank act as depositary bank. The depositary bank is the institution that issues ADRs, maintains a record of the holders of ADRs, registers the trades carried out, and distributes the dividends or interest on shareholders equity payments in dollars to the holders of the ADRs. In a sponsored ADR, the depositary bank works with the foreign company and their custodian bank in their home country to register and issue the ADRs. An unsponsored ADR is instead issued by a depositary bank without the involvement, participation, or even the consent of the foreign company it represents ownership in. Unsponsored ADRs are normally issued by broker-dealers that own common stock in a foreign company and trade over-the-counter (OTC). Sponsored ADRs are more commonly found on exchanges.

ADRs provide listing to foreign shares in one market: the U.S. <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gdr.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Global Depositary Receipts</a> (GDRs) instead give access to two or more markets, most frequently the U.S. market and the Euromarkets, with one fungible security. GDRs are most commonly used when the issuer is raising capital in the local market as well as in the international and US markets, either through private placement or public offerings.

<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/ads.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">American depositary shares</a> (ADS) are the actual underlying shares that the ADR represents. In other words, the ADS is the actual share available for trading, while the ADR represents the entire bundle of ADSs issued.
