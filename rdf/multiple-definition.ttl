A multiple measures some aspect of a company's financial well-being, determined by dividing one <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/metrics.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">metric</a> by another metric. Metrics are quantitative tools that measure a company's performance. The metric in the numerator is typically larger than the one in the denominator. Investors use multiples to quantify a company's growth, productivity, and efficiency. They use multiples to make comparisons among companies and find the best investment opportunities.

For example, a multiple can be used to show how much investors are willing to pay per dollar of earnings, as computed by the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-earningsratio.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio</a>. Assume you are analyzing a stock with $2 of <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eps.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">earnings per share</a> (EPS), which is trading at $20. This stock has a P/E of 10. This means investors are willing to pay a multiple of 10 times the current EPS for the stock.

This is calculated as:

In the world of stock <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valuation.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">valuation</a>, investors and analysts generally rely on two major methods. One is based on cash flow, while the other is based on a multiple of some performance measure, such as earnings or sales. Valuation based on cash flow (i.e., the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">discounted cash flow analysis</a>) is considered to be an intrinsic valuation. Valuation based on a multiple is considered to be relative because the multiple is relative to some performance measure. The <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/multiplesapproach.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">multiples approach</a> to valuation is a theory based on the concept that similar assets should sell for similar prices.

The most common multiple used in the valuation of stocks is the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/fundamental-analysis/10/should-you-trust-pe-ratios.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">P/E multiple</a>. It is used to compare a company's market value (price) with its earnings. A company with a price or market value that is high compared to its level of earnings has a high P/E multiple. A company with a low price compared to its level of earnings has a low P/E multiple.

A P/E of 5x means a companyâ€™s stock is trading at a multiple of five times its earnings. A P/E of 10x means a company is trading at a multiple that is equal to 10 times earnings. A company with a high P/E is considered to be <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/overvalued.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">overvalued</a>. Likewise, a company with a low P/E is considered to be <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/undervalued.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">undervalued</a>.

<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/enterprisevalue.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Enterprise value</a> (EV) is a popular performance metric used to calculate different types of multiples. EV shows how much money would be needed to buy a specific company. The EV of a company is calculated by taking the company's <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">market capitalization</a>, adding total debt (including long-term and short-term debt), and subtracting all cash and cash equivalents. Many investors see EV as a better performance metric than relying on market capitalization alone because it offers a more complete picture of a company's valuation.

A widely used multiple is the EV to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebitda.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">EBITDA</a>) multiple, also referred to as <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/072715/what-considered-healthy-evebitda.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">EV/EBITDA</a>. This multiple helps investors compare companies in the same industry or sector before making an investment decision.

The EV to <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebit.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">earnings before interest and taxes</a> (EBIT) multiple, also referred to as EV/EBIT, is similar to the P/E multiple, but is preferred by some analysts for its ability to give a more complete picture of a company's financial performance and actual worth. The multiple is useful for pinpointing companies that might be undervalued or overvalued. It's best used for less capital-intensive companies, with fewer depreciation and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/amortization.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">amortization</a> expenses.

The EV to sales ratio, also referred to as <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/enterprisevaluesales.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">EV/sales</a>, compares the enterprise value of a company to its annual sales. The EV/sales multiple is considered an important valuation tool because it takes into account a company's equity and debt while giving investors a quantifiable metric of how to value a company based on sales. It's also useful in evaluating companies with <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/121013/how-value-companies-negative-earnings.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">negative earnings</a>. To be most effective, investors should compare the EV/sales multiple of the company they are analyzing to that of other companies in the same industry.
