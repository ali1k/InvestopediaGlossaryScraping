The debit balance in a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marginaccount.asp">margin account</a> is the total amount of money owed by the customer to a broker or other lender for funds borrowed to purchase <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp">securities</a>. The debit balance is the amount of cash the customer must have in the account following the execution of a security purchase order so that the transaction can be settled properly.

When <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/buying-on-margin.asp">buying on margin</a>, investors borrow funds from a broker and then combine those funds with their own in order to purchase a greater number of shares and, hopefully, earn a greater profit. This is known as <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leverage.asp">leveraging</a> their position.

The two primary types of investment accounts used to buy and sell financial assets are a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashaccount.asp">cash account</a> and a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marginaccount.asp">margin account</a>. In a cash account, an investor can only spend the cash balance on deposit and no more. For example, if the trader only has $1,000 in their cash account, they can only buy securities worth a total value of $1,000.

A margin account allows an investor or trader to borrow money from the broker to purchase additional shares or, in the case of a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortsale.asp">short sale</a>, to borrow shares to sell in the market. An investor with a $1,000 cash balance may want to purchase shares worth $1,800. In this case, their broker can lend them the $800 through a margin account. In this hypothetical case, the debit balance would be $800 since that is the amount owed in the margin account to the broker for funds advanced to purchase securities.

The debit balance can be contrasted with the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditbalance.asp">credit balance</a>. While a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long.asp">long margin position</a> has a debit balance, a margin account with only <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/short.asp">short positions</a> will show a credit balance. The credit balance is the sum of the proceeds from a short sale and the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="4" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/initialmargin.asp">required margin</a> amount.

A margin account might have both long and short margin positions. An <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/adjusteddebitbalance.asp">adjusted debit balance</a> is the amount in a margin account that is owed to the brokerage firm, minus profits on short sales and balances in a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/specialmemorandumaccount.asp">special memorandum account</a> (SMA).

In a margin account, the brokerage customer can borrow funds from the brokerage firm to purchase securities and pledge cash or securities already in the margin account as <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/collateral.asp">collateral</a>. The adjusted debit balance informs the investor how much would be owed to the broker in the event of a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margincall.asp">margin call</a>, which requires repayment of the borrowed funds to the brokerage firm.

Industry regulations permit an investor to borrow up to 50% of the purchase price of securities on margin, which is stipulated in <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/regulationt.asp">Regulation T</a>.
