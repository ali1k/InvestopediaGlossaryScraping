A corporate tax is a tax on the profits of a corporation. The taxes are paid on a company's taxable income, which includes revenue minus <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cogs.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">cost of goods sold</a> (COGS), <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/general-and-administrative-expenses.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">general and administrative (G&amp;A) expenses</a>, selling and marketing, research and development, depreciation, and other operating costs.

Corporate tax rates vary widely by country, with some countries considered to be <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxhaven.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">tax havens</a> due to their low rates. Corporate taxes can be lowered by various <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deduction.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">deductions</a>, government <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/subsidy.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">subsidies</a>, and tax <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="4" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/loophole.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">loopholes</a>, and so the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="5" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/effectivetaxrate.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">effective corporate tax rate</a>, the rate a corporation actually pays, is usually lower than the statutory rate; the stated rate before any deductions.

The federal corporate tax rate in the United States is currently a flat 21%, as a result of the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/taxes/trumps-tax-reform-plan-explained/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tax Cuts and Jobs Act</a> (TCJA), which President Donald Trump signed into law in 2017 and which went into effect in 2018. Previously, the maximum U.S. corporate income tax rate was 35%.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿

U.S. corporate tax returns are typically due March 15. Corporations may request a six-month extension to file their corporate <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxreturn.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">tax returns</a> in September. Installment payment due dates for estimated tax returns occur in the middle of April, June, September, and December. Corporate taxes are reported on Form 1120 for U.S. corporations. If a corporation has more than $10 million in assets, it must file online.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5">﻿</span>﻿

<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corporation.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Corporations</a> are permitted to reduce taxable income by certain necessary and ordinary <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/businessexpenses.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">business expenditures</a>. All current expenses required for the operation of the business are fully <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tax-deduction.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">tax-deductible</a>. Investments and real estate purchased with the intent of generating income for the business are also deductible.

A corporation can deduct employee salaries, health benefits, tuition reimbursement, and bonuses. In addition, a corporation can reduce its taxable income by deducting <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurance-premium.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">insurance premiums</a>, travel expenses, bad debts, interest payments, sales taxes, fuel taxes, and excise taxes. Tax preparation fees, legal services, bookkeeping, and advertising costs can also be used to reduce business income.

A central issue relating to corporate taxation is the concept of <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/double_taxation.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">double taxation</a>. Certain corporations are taxed on the taxable income of the company. If this net income is distributed to <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholder.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">shareholders</a>, these individuals are forced to pay individual income taxes on the dividends received. Instead, a business may register as an <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/subchapters.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">S corporation</a> and have all income pass-through to the business owners. An S corporation does not pay corporate tax as all taxes are paid through individual tax returns.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4">﻿</span>﻿

Paying corporate taxes can be more beneficial for business owners than paying additional individual income tax. Corporate tax returns deduct medical insurance for families as well as fringe benefits, including <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/retirement-planning.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">retirement plans</a> and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxdeferred.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">tax-deferred</a> trusts. It is easier for a corporation to deduct losses, too.

A corporation may deduct the entire amount of losses while a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/soleproprietorship.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">sole proprietor</a> must provide evidence regarding the intent to earn a profit before the losses can be deducted. Finally, profit earned by a corporation may be left within the corporation, allowing for tax planning and potential future tax advantages.
