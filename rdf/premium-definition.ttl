Premium has multiple meanings in finance, with the first being the total cost to buy an <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">option</a>. A premium is also the difference between the price paid for a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixed-incomesecurity.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">fixed-income security</a> and the security's face amount at issue. Finally, a premium is also the specified amount of payment required periodically by an insurer to provide coverage under a given insurance plan for a defined period of time.

Premiums for options are the cost to buy an option. Options give the holder (owner) the right but not the obligation to buy or sell the underlying financial instrument at a specified strike price. The premium for a bond reflects changes in interest rates or risk profile since the issuance date.

Premiums for insurance include the compensation the insurer receives for bearing the risk of a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/payout.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">payout</a> should an event occur that triggers coverage. The most common types of coverage are auto, health, and homeowners insurance.

The buyer of an option has the right but not the obligation to buy (call) or sell (put) the underlying instrument at a given strike price for a given period of time. The premium that is paid is its intrinsic value plus its <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/timevalue.asp">time value</a>; an option with a longer maturity always costs more than the same structure with a shorter maturity. The <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volatility.asp">volatility</a> of the market and how close the strike price is to the then-current market price also affect the premium.

Sophisticated investors sometimes sell one option (also known as writing an option) and use the premium received to cover the cost of buying the underlying instrument or another option. Buying multiple options can either increase or reduce the risk profile of the position, depending on how it is structured.

The concept of a bond price premium is directly related to the principle that the price of a bond is inversely related to interest rates; if a fixed-income security is purchased at a premium, this means that then-current interest rates are lower than the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coupon-rate.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">coupon rate</a> of the bond. The investor thus pays a premium for an investment that will return an amount greater than existing interest rates.

Premiums are paid for many types of insurance, including health, homeowners, and rental insurance. A common example of an <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurance-premium.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">insurance premium</a> comes from <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/auto-insurance.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">auto insurance</a>. A vehicle owner can insure the value of their vehicle against loss resulting from accident, theft, fire, and other potential problems.Â 

The owner usually pays a fixed premium amount in exchange for the insurance company's guarantee to cover any <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economicprofit.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">economic losses</a> incurred under the scope of the agreement. Premiums are based on both the risk associated with the insured and the amount of coverage desired.
