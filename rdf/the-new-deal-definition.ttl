The New Deal was a comprehensive and broad set of government-directed projects introduced by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt in an attempt to help the United States <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economy.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">economy</a> emerge from the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/great_depression.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Great Depression</a>. It launched in the early 1930s and was designed to bolster the United States economy, reduce unemployment, provide a social safety net, and instill confidence in the government’s ability to protect its citizens.

The <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock-market-crash.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">stock market crash</a> of 1929 began on October 24—a day known as <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blackthursday.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Thursday</a>. It brought a period of roaring growth to a sudden halt.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿﻿ Companies and banks across the United States started failing, and the unemployment rate skyrocketed to the point that nearly a quarter of the workforce was unemployed.

President Franklin Roosevelt launched the New Deal after taking office in 1933.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2">﻿</span>﻿﻿ It consisted of a variety of government-funded programs aimed at getting people back to work, as well as legislation and executive orders that propped up farmers and stimulated business activity.

The New Deal engendered controversy by introducing a number of radical reforms and increasing the government’s role in guiding the economy. Several of its programs were ultimately declared unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court, including two major pillars: the National Recovery Administration (NRA)—which set working conditions, minimum wages, and maximum hours, while guaranteeing the right of labor to <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/collective-bargaining.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">bargain collectively</a>—and the Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA), which intended to stabilize farm prices.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4">﻿</span>﻿<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿

Public opinion was for the New Deal, though, and, as a result, in February of 1937 Roosevelt tried to increase the number of Supreme Court justices in order to prevent future programs from being shuttered.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5">﻿</span>﻿﻿ Though he failed in this court-packing attempt, he succeeded in his objective. In May 1937, the Supreme Court declared the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/social-security-act.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Social Security Act</a> to be constitutional by a five-to-four vote after one of its justices changed his anti–New Deal stance. No other New Deal program was ever again judicially invalidated by the court.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6">﻿</span>﻿﻿

The New Deal is often broken into two segments. The “first” New Deal was launched in 1933 during the initial two years of the Roosevelt presidency. In addition to the NRA and AAA, it consisted of measures to stabilize the banking system (<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/emergencybankingact.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emergency Banking Act</a>), ensure bank deposit security (Banking Act of 1933, known as the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/glass_steagall_act.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Glass-Steagall Act</a>), and increase confidence in the stock market (<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/securitiesact1933.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Securities Act of 1933</a>).﻿

The “second” New Deal, in 1935, introduced perhaps <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/121015/how-social-security-works-after-retirement.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">the program’s greatest and most enduring legacy</a>: government-sponsored retirement plans in the form of Social Security. It also increased government employment (Works Progress Administration) and minimum wages (<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fair-labor-standards-act-flsa.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fair Labor Standards Act</a>).

<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/011116/economic-effects-new-deal.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Historians credit the New Deal with some success in reviving the country’s fortunes</a>. The economy did slowly recover during the 1930s, confidence was restored to the banking system through federal deposit insurance, working conditions were improved, and labor unions strengthened the hand of workers.

It was World War II, however, that ultimately provided the impetus to get America fully back to work. The unprecedented spending worldwide on ships, arms, and planes propelled the country into <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fullemployment.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">full employment</a>—a feat that the New Deal programs, despite their best efforts, were unable to achieve on their own.
