The term United States Agency for International Development (USAID) refers to an international development agency run by the United States government. The organization provides international development and humanitarian assistance in a number of areas to <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/updates/top-developing-countries/" rel="noopener noreferrer">developing nations</a> while promoting American interests, U.S. national security, and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/08/genuine-progress-indicator-gpi.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">economic prosperity</a> abroad.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿ <span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2">﻿</span>﻿ USAID was established in 1961 and works in more than 100 countries.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿

The United States Agency for International Development was developed in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy. He created the agency after signing an executive order to advance American interests abroad through development efforts and humanitarian aid.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿ With the global <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economy.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">economy</a> still relatively fragile less than two decades after the end of World War II, it was essential for the U.S.'s own prosperity to promote growth in developing countries and to help nations maintain their independence and freedom.

USAID works in more than 100 developing countries spanning the globe in areas such as sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, the Middle East, Latin America, the Caribbean, Europe, and Eurasia.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4">﻿</span>﻿ The agency, which has field offices in the areas noted above, is headquartered in Washington, D.C., with organizational units that are called bureaus. Those working in each unit are responsible for programs and activities in a specific country.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5">﻿</span>﻿

The agency's mission and objectives remain the same today. According to the website, USAID's mission is to boost democratic values across the world, helping nations become self-reliant as they progress in their own development.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿ While promoting development and reducing <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/poverty.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">poverty</a> are among its aims, it also promotes democratic governance in recipient nations, and helps counteract the drivers of violence, instability, transnational crime, and other security threats.

The international agency works in a number of different <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sector.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">sectors</a> including:

Development assistance is not simply the act of giving aid, but of supporting development efforts so that recipient countries become self-reliant. Some examples of the type of assistance USAID provides in reaching these goals are <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/040715/what-microlending-and-how-does-it-work.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">small-enterprise loans</a>, technical assistance, food and disaster relief, helping prevent the spread of pandemic disease, and training and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/understanding-scholarships-need-and-merit-4783132" rel="noopener noreferrer">scholarships</a>.

The agency reports directly to the United States Congress on certain important matters. This is done through regular reports that the agency submits. These reports are also available on the agency's website in order to remain transparent to the general public.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6">﻿</span>﻿
