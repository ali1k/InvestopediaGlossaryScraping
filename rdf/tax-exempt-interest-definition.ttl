Tax-exempt interest is interest income that is not subject to federal income tax. In some cases, the amount of tax-exempt interest a taxpayer earns can limit the taxpayer's qualification for certain other tax breaks. The most common sources of tax-exempt interest come from municipal bonds or income-producing assets inside of <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rothira.asp">Roth retirement accounts</a>.

Tax-exempt interest can be somewhat of a misnomer as it may still be taxed at the state or local levels. It may also be subject to the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/alternativeminimumtax.asp">alternative minimum tax</a> (AMT).<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿ Furthermore, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalgain.asp">capital gains</a> on tax-exempt investments are still taxable; only the interest on these investments is tax-exempt.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7">﻿</span>﻿ The most common way to earn interest that is tax-exempt at the state and local levels in addition to the federal level is for an investor to purchase a municipal bond issued in his or her state or locality of residence.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿

<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/municipalbond.asp">Municipal bonds</a> are one of the most common types of investments that pay tax-exempt interest, but while interest may be tax-exempt at the federal level it may still be taxed at the state level. For example, a California resident who buys a New York municipal bond would pay California income tax on that interest.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8">﻿</span>﻿ These tax laws, however, vary by state. For instance, some states such as Wisconsin and Illinois tax interest earned on most muni bonds, including their own,<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10">﻿</span>﻿ <span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9">﻿</span>﻿ while states such as California and Arizona exempt interest from taxes if the investor resides in their states.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12">﻿</span>﻿ <span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11">﻿</span>﻿ Utah is an example of a state that exempts interest on out-of-state bonds, as long as that state does not impose a tax on bonds issued by Utah.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13">﻿</span>﻿ <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurybond.asp">Treasury securities</a> issued by the U.S. government pay interest that is tax exempt at the state and local levels, but not the federal level.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2">﻿</span>﻿

According to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), interest on a state or local government obligation may be tax-exempt even if the obligation is not a bond. For example, interest on a debt evidenced only by an ordinary written agreement of purchase and sale may be tax-exempt. Also, interest paid by an insurer on default by the state or political subdivision may be tax-exempt.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿

<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutualfund.asp">Mutual funds</a> that hold a mix of stocks and municipal bonds will have the portion of earnings derived from the bonds tax-exempt under federal income tax guidelines and possibly exempt from state taxes depending on the location from which the bonds originated and/or the taxpayer's state of residence.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14">﻿</span>﻿

Since tax-exempt interest is not subject to <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incometax.asp">income taxes</a>, it is not included in the calculation of <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/agi.asp">adjusted gross income</a> (AGI) for taxation purposes.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4">﻿</span>﻿ Issuers or lenders that pay more than $10 in tax-exempt interest must report the interest income to both taxpayers and the IRS on <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/form-1099-int.asp">Form 1099-INT</a>.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5">﻿</span>﻿ Taxpayers or borrowers, in turn, must report this tax-exempt interest on <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="4" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/1040.asp">Form 1040</a>.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4">﻿</span>﻿ The amount received as tax-exempt interest is used by the IRS to determine what amount of the taxpayer’s <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="5" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/social-security-benefits.asp">Social Security benefits</a> is taxable.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6">﻿</span>﻿
