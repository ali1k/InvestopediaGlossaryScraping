The eurozone, officially known as the euro area, is a geographic and economic region that consists of all the European Union countries that have fully incorporated the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/euro.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">euro</a> as their national currency. As of Aug. 2020, the eurozone consists of 19 countries in the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/europeanunion.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">European Union</a> (EU): Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿ Approximately 340 million people live in the eurozone area.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2">﻿</span>﻿

The eurozone is one of the largest economic regions in the world and its <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currency.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">currency</a>, the euro, is considered one of the most <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidasset.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">liquid</a> when compared to others. This region's currency continues to develop over time and is taking a more prominent position in the reserves of many <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/centralbank.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">central banks</a>. It is often used as an example when studying <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="4" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trilemma.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">trilemmas</a>, an economic theory that postulates that nations have three options when making decisions regarding their international monetary policies.

In 1992, the countries making up the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/european-community.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">European Community (EC)</a> signed the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maastricht-treaty.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maastricht Treaty</a>, thereby creating the EU. The creation of the EU had a few areas of major impact—it promoted greater coordination and cooperation in policy, broadly speaking, but it had specific effects on citizenship, security and defense policy, and economic policy. 

Regarding economic policy, the Maastricht Treaty aimed to create a common economic and monetary union, with a central banking system—the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/europeancentralbank.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">European Central Bank</a> (ECB)—and a common currency (the euro).

In order to do this, the treaty called for the free movement of capital between the member states, which then graduated into increased cooperation between national central banks and the increased alignment of economic policy among member states. The final step was the introduction of the euro itself, along with the implementation of a singular <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monetarypolicy.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">monetary policy</a> coming from the ECB.

For various reasons, not all EU nations are members of the eurozone. Denmark has opted out from joining, although it can do so in the future.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿ Some EU nations have not yet met the conditions needed to join the eurozone. Other countries choose to use their own currency as a way to <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/050515/why-these-european-countries-dont-use-euro.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">maintain their financial independence</a> regarding key economic and monetary issues.

Some countries that are not EU nations have adopted the euro as their national currency. The Vatican City, Andorra, Monaco, and San Marino have monetary agreements with the EU allowing them to issue their own euro currency under certain restrictions.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿

In order to join the eurozone and use the euro as their currency, EU nations must meet certain convergence criteria or requirements. The criteria consist of four <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/macroeconomics.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">macroeconomic</a> indicators that focus on price stability, sound and sustainable public finances, the durability of convergence, and exchange rate stability.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿

For an EU nation to demonstrate price stability, it must have a sustainable price performance and average inflation not more than 1.5 percentage points above the rate of the three best performing member states. To demonstrate sound public finances, the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiscaldeficit.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">government's deficits</a> and debts are reviewed and must show the government is not under excessive deficit pressure.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿

A nation's durability of convergence is assessed through its long-term interest rates, which should not be more than 2 percentage points above the rate of the three best performing member states in terms of price stability. Lastly, the nation must demonstrate exchange rate stability by participating in the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exchange-rate-mechanism.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exchange Rate Mechanism</a> (ERM) II for at least two years without severe tensions and without devaluing against the euro.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿
