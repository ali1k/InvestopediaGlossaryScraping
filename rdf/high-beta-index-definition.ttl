A high beta index is a basket of stocks that exhibits greater volatility than a broad market index such as the S&amp;P 500 Index. The S&amp;P 500 High Beta Index is the most well-known of these indexes. It tracks the performance of 100 companies in the S&amp;P 500 that are the most sensitive to changes in market returns.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿

<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beta.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beta</a> is the amount of volatility or systematic risk an asset exhibits compared to the market as a whole. Besides the flagship large-cap index, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sp.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Standard and Poor's</a> offers a number of high beta variations for small-cap, mid-cap and other market indexes.﻿ 

High beta index companies exhibit greater sensitivity than the broader market. Sensitivity is measured by the beta of an individual stock. A beta of 1 indicates the asset moves in line with the market. Anything less than 1 represents an asset less volatile than the market, while greater than 1 suggests a more volatile asset.

For example, a beta of 1.2 means the asset is 20% more volatile than the market. Conversely, a beta of 0.70 is theoretically 30% less volatile than the market. Beta is measured against a widely followed index such as the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sp500.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">S&amp;P 500 Index</a>. 

Gaining exposure to a high beta index requires an investment vehicle such as an <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">exchange traded fund</a> (ETF). The Invesco S&amp;P 500 High Beta ETF (<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=sphb" rel="noopener noreferrer">SPHB</a>) is a widely traded asset that tracks volatile assets in the broader market. The ETF has underperformed the underlying S&amp;P 500 Index since its inception.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4">﻿</span>﻿﻿ Financial companies constitute nearly 30% of the fund's assets, with Discover Financial Services (<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=dfs" rel="noopener noreferrer">DFS</a>), Lincoln National Corp (<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="4" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=lnc" rel="noopener noreferrer">LNC</a>) and Invesco (<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="5" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=ivz" rel="noopener noreferrer">IVZ</a>) among its largest holdings.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿﻿

Contrary to popular belief, high beta or volatility doesn't necessarily translate into greater returns. For many years, the High Beta S&amp;P 500 Index has underperformed its underlying benchmark.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5">﻿</span>﻿﻿ This occurred during a period of unyielding improvement in the broader market.

Instead, research shows that low volatility stocks tend to earn greater risk-adjusted returns than high volatility stocks. The reason low beta tends to outperform can be attributed to investment <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/behavioralfinance.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">behavioral biases</a>, such as the representative heuristic and overconfidence. In addition, sector selection and other fundamental criteria play an important role in the volatility and performance of a high beta index.
