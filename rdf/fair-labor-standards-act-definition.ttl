The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) is a U.S. law that is intended to protect workers against certain unfair pay practices. As such, the FLSA sets out various labor regulations regarding interstate commerce employment, including <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/minimum_wage.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">minimum wages</a>, requirements for overtime pay, and limitations on child labor. The FLSA—which was passed in 1938 and has seen numerous changes—is one of the most important laws for employers to understand, as it sets out a wide array of regulations for dealing with employees, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/031115/salary-vs-hourly-how-benefits-laws-differ.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">whether salaried or paid by the hour</a>.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿

The FLSA specifies when workers are “on the clock” and which times are not paid hours. There are also elaborate rules concerning whether employees are <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exempt-employee.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">exempt</a> or <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nonexempt-employee.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">nonexempt</a> from the FLSA overtime regulations. The law requires overtime to be paid at 1.5 times the regular hourly rate (“time-and-a-half”) for all hours worked in excess of 40 hours during a seven-day workweek.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5">﻿</span>﻿

The FLSA applies to workers who have an employer and are engaged in interstate commerce or in the production of goods for commerce; it also applies to workers who are employed by an enterprise engaged in commerce or the production of goods for commerce. Further included are domestic service workers (housekeepers, cooks, full-time babysitters) and employees of hospitals; schools for mentally or physically disabled or gifted children; educational institutions at any level, from preschools to universities; and public agencies.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4">﻿</span>﻿ <span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2">﻿</span>﻿

It does not apply to <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/independent-contractor.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">independent contractors</a> or volunteers because they are not considered employees.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9">﻿</span>﻿ Employers that have at least $500,000 per year in <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/grosssales.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">gross sales</a> or other business are subject to the requirements of the FLSA, which means that their employees are eligible for FLSA protections.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2">﻿</span>﻿

Nonexempt employees are entitled to overtime pay, while exempt employees are not. Most FLSA-covered employees are nonexempt. Some hourly workers are not covered by the FLSA but are subject instead to other regulations.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5">﻿</span>﻿ For example, railroad workers are governed by the Railway Labor Act, and truck drivers fall under the purview of the Motor Carriers Act.

White-collar workers (executive, professional, and administrative workers) are not protected by FLSA rules when it comes to overtime.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7">﻿</span>﻿ Farmworkers may be considered jointly employed by a labor contractor, who recruits, organizes, transports, and pays them, and a farmer, who needs their services and pays the labor contractor for their services.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10">﻿</span>﻿ Such situations sometimes see employers falsely categorize such workers as volunteers when they meet the definition of “employee” under the FLSA.

The FLSA also sets the groundwork for how to treat jobs that are primarily compensated by way of tipping. In such a case, an employer must pay the minimum wage to the employee unless they regularly receive more than $30 per month from gratuities. <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/041615/whats-average-hourly-wage-waiters-and-bartenders-tips.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">If that employee’s pay (tips included) does not equal minimum wage</a>, then the employer must make up the difference. Such workers must either receive all their tips or be included in a tip pool, for which the FLSA sets guidelines. Busboys are meant to be included in a tip pool under FLSA rules because of the customer-visible nature of their work.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿
