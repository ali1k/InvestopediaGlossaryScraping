In accounting, an asset retirement obligation (ARO) describes a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tangibleasset.asp">tangible</a>, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/longtermassets.asp">long-lived asset</a>, where a company will be responsible for removing equipment or cleaning up hazardous materials at some future date. AROs should be included in a company's financial statement to present a more accurate and holistic snapshot of the enterprise's overall value.

Asset retirement obligation accounting often applies to companies that create physical infrastructure which must be dismantled before a land <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lease.asp">lease</a> expires, such as underground fuel storage tanks at gas stations. AROs also apply to the removal of hazardous elements and/or waste materials from the land, such as nuclear power plant decontamination. The asset is considered to be retired once the clean up/removal activity is complete, and the property is restored back to its original condition.

Consider an oil-drilling company that acquires a 40-year lease on a parcel of land. Five years into the lease, the company finishes constructing a drilling rig. This item must be removed, and the land must be cleaned up once the lease expires in 35 years. Although the current cost for doing so is $15,000, an estimate for inflation for the removal and remediation work over the next 35 years is 2.5% per year. Consequently, for this ARO, the assumed future cost after inflation would be calculated as follows: 15,000 * (1 + 0.025) ^ 35 = 35,598.08.

Because calculating asset retirement obligations can be complex, businesses should seek guidance from Certified Public Accountants to ensure compliance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board's <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" href="http://www.fasb.org/jsp/FASB/Document_C/DocumentPage?cid=1218220124991&amp;acceptedDisclaimer=true">Rule No. 143: Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations</a>. Under this mandate, public companies must recognize the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fairvalue.asp">fair value</a> of their AROs on their <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/introduction-balance-sheet/">balance sheets</a> in an effort to render them more accurate. This represents somewhat of a departure from the income-statement approach many businesses previously used.

To <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" href="https://www.accountingtools.com/articles/2017/5/5/asset-retirement-obligation">calculate the expected present value of an ARO</a>, companies should observe the following iterative steps:
