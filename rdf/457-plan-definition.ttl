Generally speaking, 457 plans are <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/non-qualified-plan.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">non-qualified</a>, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tax-advantaged.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">tax-advantaged, </a><a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deferred-compensation.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">deferred compensation</a> <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="4" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/retirement/08/best-plan.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">retirement plans</a> offered by state governments, local governments, and some nonprofit employers. Eligible participants are able to make salary deferral contributions, depositing pre-tax money that is allowed to compound without being taxed until it is withdrawn.

Notably, 457 plans are similar in nature to <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/401kplan.asp">401(k)</a><strong> </strong>plans, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/100314/what-difference-between-401k-plan-and-457-plan.asp">only rather than</a> being offered to employees at for-profit companies, they cater to state and local public workers, together with highly paid executives at certain nonprofit organizations, such as charities.

Participants of these <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/definedcontributionplan.asp">defined contribution plans</a> set aside a percentage of their salary for retirement. These funds are transferred to the retirement account, where they grow in value without being taxed. There are two types of 457 plans:

Employees are allowed to contribute up to 100% of their salary, provided it does not exceed the applicable dollar limit for the year. If the plan does not meet statutory requirements, the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp">assets</a> may be subject to different rules.

As of 2021, employees can contribute <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/401k-contribution-limit-increases-to-19500-for-2020-catch-up-limit-rises-to-6500" rel="noopener noreferrer">up to $19,500 per year</a>. In some cases, workers are able to contribute even more.

For example, if an employer permits <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/catchupcontribution.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">catch-up contributions</a>, workers over the age of 50 may contribute an additional $6,500, making their maximum contribution limit $26,000 ($19,500 + $6,500). 

Also, 457(b) plans feature a "double limit catch-up" provision. This is designed to allow participants who are nearing retirement to compensate for years in which they did not contribute to the plan but were eligible to do so. In this case, employees who are within three years of retirement age (as specified in their plan), may contribute $39,000, twice the annual contribution limit.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿ 

A lesser-known feature of the 457(b) plan is that the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irs.asp">Internal Revenue Service</a> (IRS) also special catch-up deferrals. The special pre-retirement catch-up deferral allows participants to make additional contributions for the three years prior to reaching normal retirement age. The special pre-retirement catch-up limit is double the normal limit, for a total of $39,000 in 2020 and 2021.

Contributions are taken from paychecks on a pre-tax basis, resulting in lower <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxableincome.asp">taxable income</a>. For example, if Alex was earning $4,000 per month and contributing $700 to a 457(b) plan, Alex's taxable income for the month is $3,300.

Employees also have the option to invest their contributions in a selection of <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutualfund.asp">mutual funds</a>. Importantly, any interest and earnings generated from these vehicles do not get taxed until the funds are withdrawn. Moreover, if an employee resigns, or retires early and needs to withdraw their funds, there is <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" href="https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc558">no 10% penalty</a> fee, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/100314/what-difference-between-401k-plan-and-457-plan.asp">unlike 401(k)</a>, and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="4" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/403bplan.asp">403(b)</a> plans. 

However, any early distribution from a 457 plan whereby the funds were a result of a direct transfer or rollover from a qualified retirement plan—such as a 401(k)—would be subject to the 10% penalty tax.

Employer-<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/matchingcontribution.asp">matched contributions</a> count toward the maximum contribution limit. For instance, if an employer contributes $10,000 to the plan, the employee can only add $9,000 until the $19,000 contribution limit is reached (unless they are permitted to use the catch-up option). In practice, most government employers do not offer contribution matching.
