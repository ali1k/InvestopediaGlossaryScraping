A histogram is a graphical representation that organizes a group of data points into user-specified ranges. Similar in appearance to a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bar-graph.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">bar graph</a>, the histogram condenses a data series into an easily interpreted visual by taking many data points and grouping them into logical ranges or bins.

Histograms are commonly used in <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/statistics.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">statistics</a> to demonstrate how many of a certain type of variable occurs within a specific range. For example, a census focused on the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/demographics.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">demography</a> of a country may use a histogram to show how many people are between the ages of 0 - 10, 11 - 20, 21 - 30, 31 - 40, 41 - 50, etc. This histogram would look similar to the example below.

Histograms can be customized in several ways by the analyst. The first is to change the interval between buckets. In the above example, there are 5 buckets with an interval of ten. This could be changed, for example, to 10 buckets with an interval of 5 instead.

The other consideration is how to define the y-axis. The most basic label is to use the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/frequencydistribution.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">frequency</a> of occurrences observed in the data, but one could also use percentage of total or density instead.

Both histograms and bar charts provide a visual display using columns, and people often use the terms interchangeably. More technically, a histogram represents the frequency distribution of variables in a data set. On the other hand, a bar graph typically represents a graphical comparison of discrete or categorical variables.

Technical traders may be familiar with the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/macd.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">moving average convergence divergence</a> (MACD) histogram, a popular <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technicalindicator.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">technical indicator</a> that illustrates the difference between the MACD line and the signal line.

For example, if there is a $5 difference between the two lines, the MACD histogram graphically represents this difference. The MACD histogram is plotted on a chart to make it easy for a trader to determine a specific security’s <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/momentum.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">momentum</a>.

A histogram bar is positive when the MACD line is above the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/signal_line.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">signal line</a>, and negative when the MACD line is below the signal line. An increasing <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/technical/091001.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">MACD histogram</a> indicates an increase in upward momentum, while a decreasing histogram is used to signal downward momentum.

Traders often overlook the MACD histogram when using this indicator to make trading decisions. A weakness of using the MACD indicator in its traditional sense, when the MACD line <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/stock-analysis/cotd/022614/bullish-and-bearish-macd-crossovers-lnkd-wyn-amt-twc.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">crosses</a> over the signal line, is that the trading signal lags price. Because the two lines are <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/movingaverage.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">moving averages</a>, they do not cross until a price move has already occurred. This means that traders forego a portion of this initial move.

The MACD histogram helps to alleviate this problem by generating earlier entry signals. Traders can track the length of the histogram bars as they move away from the zero line. The indicator generates a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trade-signal.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">trading signal</a> when a histogram bar is shorter in length than the preceding bar. Once the smaller histogram bar completes, traders open a position in the direction of the histogram’s decline.

Other technical indicators should be used in conjunction with the MACD histogram to increase the signal’s reliability. Moreover, traders should place a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stop-lossorder.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">stop-loss order</a> to close the trade if the security’s price does not move as anticipated.
