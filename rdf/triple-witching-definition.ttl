Triple witching is the simultaneous expiration of <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockoption.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">stock options</a>, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indexfutures.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">stock index futures</a>, and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indexoption.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">stock index option</a> contracts all on the same day. It happens four times a year: on the third Friday of March, June, September, and December. Because three option classes expire all on the same day, it can cause increased trading volume and unusual price action in the underlying assets.

Similarly, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/doublewitching.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">double witching</a> occurs when two classes of option expire on the same date, and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quadruplewitching.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">quadruple witching</a> when four do.

Triple witching days generate trading activity and volatility because contracts that are allowed to expire may necessitate the purchase or sale of the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underlying-security.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">underlying security</a>. While some <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/derivative.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">derivative</a> contracts are opened with the intention of buying or selling the underlying security, traders seeking derivative exposure only must close, roll out, or offset their open positions prior to the close of trading on triple witching days.

Triple witching days, particularly the final hour of trading preceding the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/closingbell.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">closing bell</a>, known as the "triple witching hour," can result in escalated trading activity and volatility as <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trader.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">traders</a> close, roll out, or offset their expiring positions.

Since 2002, with the debut of <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/singlestockfuture.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">single stock futures</a>,<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿ there have actually been four types of expiring contracts, meaning triple witching days are in fact a "quadruple witching," though this term has not quite caught on.

A <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futurescontract.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">futures contract</a>, which is an agreement to buy or sell an underlying security at a predetermined price on a specified day, mandates the agreed-upon transaction to take place after the expiration of the contract. For example, one futures contract on the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sp500.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 Index (S&amp;P 500)</a> is valued at 250 times the value of the index.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2">﻿</span>﻿ If the index is priced at $2,000 at expiration, the underlying value of the contract is $500,000, which is the amount the contract owner is obligated to pay if the contract is allowed to expire.

To avoid this obligation, the contract owner closes the contract by selling it prior to <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expirationdate.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">expiration</a>. After closing the expiring contract, exposure to the S&amp;P 500 index can be maintained by purchasing a new contract in a forward month. This is referred to as rolling out a contract.

Options that are in the money (ITM) present a similar situation for holders of expiring contracts. For example, the seller of a covered <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">call option</a> can have the underlying shares <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calledaway.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">called away</a> if the share price closes above the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strikeprice.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">strike price</a> of the expiring option. In this situation, the option seller has the option to close the position prior to expiration to continue holding the shares, or allow the option to expire and have the shares called away.

While much of the trading in closing, opening, and offsetting futures and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/optionscontract.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">options contracts</a> during triple witching days is related to the squaring of positions, the surge of activity can also drive price inefficiencies, which draws short-term <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/arbitrageur.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">arbitrageurs</a>. These opportunities are often the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/catalyst.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">catalysts</a> for heavy volume going into the close on triple witching days, as traders attempt to profit on small price imbalances with large round-trip trades that may be completed in seconds.
