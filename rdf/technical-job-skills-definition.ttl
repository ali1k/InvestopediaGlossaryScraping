Technical job skills, sometimes referred to as <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hard-skills.asp">hard skills</a>, are specific talents and expertise an individual possesses that help them perform a certain task or job. These skills differ from <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/soft-skills.asp">soft skills</a>, which instead describe character and personality traits.

Technical skills are abilities an individual acquires through practice and learning, although a person may bring an inherent propensity for a certain skill. An individual who possesses a particular proficiency for coding, for instance, would have a sought-after technical skill as a job candidate at a software or technology company.

Technical job skills are ideal to list on the skill section of a resume because they shine a light on abilities and strengths. However, it is important to realize not all technical skills at an individual’s disposal should be listed. The list should be tailored to fit the job. This gives the individual a greater chance of getting hired.

New or prospective employees may be subject to an <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aptitude-test.asp">aptitude test</a> to measure their proficiency at various technical skills and abilities. Aptitude tests assume that individuals have inherent strengths and weaknesses, and have a natural inclination toward success or failure in specific areas based on their innate characteristics. Note that an aptitude test does not test knowledge or intelligence; only a particular skill or propensity. Therefore, it is not a test for which a person can study.

Employees with technical job skills are referred to as <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/skilled-labor.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">skilled labor</a>, and may be contrasted with <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unskilled-labor.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">unskilled labor</a>.

On job applications, cover letters, resumes, and in-person during the interview process, employers seek out applicants with both hard and soft skills. Hard, or technical, skills are those abilities or skill sets that are teachable and can be quantified easily. Examples of hard skills include certificates or degrees in specific disciplines; mastery or fluidity in a foreign language; efficient operation of specific machinery; and the ability to generate computer programs.

Soft skills differ from hard skills in that they are subjective and can be incredibly difficult to quantify. Soft skills are inherent skills relating to an individual’s character or personality. These skills are sometimes referred to as “<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interpersonal-skills.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">interpersonal skills</a>” or “people skills.” Examples of soft skills include effective communication; working well with others; time management; the ability to be persuasive; flexibility; and patience.

Technical job skills play a vital role in getting hired. Certain hard skills are necessary for a variety of jobs, and some positions require a specific set or combination of these skills. However, some of the more basic or intermediate types of technical skills are fairly easy for an employer to teach to a new employee. Soft skills, because they are essentially inherent, are extremely difficult to teach. In some cases, soft skills cannot be taught.

For this reason, employers constantly look for potential employees with a mix of technical and soft skills that will allow them to complete tasks in a fast and efficient way. Because customer service/satisfaction is one of the most important aspects for any company or organization, soft skills are often considered of greater value.

Accounting is a profession that requires a fairly rigid set of technical skills. In addition to knowing the ins and outs of accounting practice and tax law, familiarity with industry-specific software, such as Great Plains, QuickBooks, Peachtree, SAP Software, and tax preparation software, is also often required these days.

<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accountant.asp">Accountants</a> need to know how to prepare and interpret <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-statements.asp">financial statements</a> and other accounting reports, develop efficient financial reporting mechanisms, and plan and implement accounting controls.

Note that some of the other skills accountants need might be categorized as soft skills. They must be prepared to communicate effectively with regulators, deal with external <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/auditor.asp">auditors</a>, and stay updated on current issues and changes in industry regulations.
