Calculate the average accounts payable for the period by adding the accounts payable balance at the beginning of the period from the accounts payable balance at the end of the period.

Divide the result by two to arrive at the average accounts payable. Take total supplier purchases for the period and divide it by the average accounts payable for the period.

In other words, the ratio measures the speed at which a company pays its suppliers. Accounts payable is listed on the balance sheet under <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentliabilities.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">current liabilities</a>.  

Investors can use the accounts payable turnover ratio to determine if a company has enough cash or revenue to meet its short-term obligations. Creditors can use the ratio to measure whether to extend a line of credit to the company.

A decreasing turnover ratio indicates that a company is taking longer to pay off its suppliers than in previous periods. The rate at which a company pays its debts could provide an indication of the company's financial condition. A decreasing ratio could signal that a company is in financial distress. Alternatively, a decreasing ratio could also mean the company has negotiated different payment arrangements with its suppliers.

When the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/turnoverratio.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">turnover ratio</a> is increasing, the company is paying off suppliers at a faster rate than in previous periods. An increasing ratio means the company has plenty of cash available to pay off its short-term debt in a timely manner. As a result, an increasing accounts payable turnover ratio could be an indication that the company managing its debts and cash flow effectively.

However, an increasing ratio over a long period could also indicate the company is not reinvesting back into its business, which could result in a lower growth rate and lower earnings for the company in the long term. Ideally, a company wants to generate enough revenue to pay off its accounts payable quickly, but not so quickly the company misses out on opportunities because they could use that money to invest in other endeavors.

The <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/receivableturnoverratio.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">accounts receivable turnover ratio</a> is an accounting measure used to quantify a company's effectiveness in collecting its receivables or money owed by clients. The ratio shows how well a company uses and manages the credit it extends to customers and how quickly that short-term debt is collected or is paid.

The accounts payable turnover ratio is used to quantify the rate at which a company pays off its suppliers. Accounts payable turnover shows how many times a company pays off its accounts payable during a period.

Accounts receivable turnover shows how quickly a company gets paid by its customers while the accounts payable turnover ratio shows how quickly the company pays its suppliers.

As with all financial ratios, it's best to compare the ratio for a company with companies in the same industry. Each sector could have a standard turnover ratio that might be unique to that industry.

A limitation of the ratio could be when a company has a high turnover ratio, which would be considered as a positive development by creditors and investors. If the ratio is so much higher than other companies within the same industry, it could indicate that the company is not investing in its future or using its cash properly.

In other words, a high or low ratio shouldn't be taken on face value, but instead, lead investors to investigate further as to the reason for the high or low ratio.

Company A purchases its materials and inventory from one supplier and for the past year had the following results:

Assume that during the same year, Company B, a competitor of Company A had the following results for the year:
