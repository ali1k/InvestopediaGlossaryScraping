The term weather <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurance.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">insurance</a> refers to a form of financial protection against losses incurred because of adverse, measurable weather conditions. These conditions generally include wind, snow, rain, fog, and snow, storms, undesirable temperatures. Weather insurance is commonly used to protect <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/business.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">businesses</a> and certain outdoor events.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿﻿﻿ As such, these policies serve various purposes, such as insuring an expensive event that could be ruined by bad weather.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2">﻿</span>﻿﻿﻿ Insurers cover insured entities if weather conditions cause a loss of <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/revenue.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">revenue</a> from events.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4">﻿</span>﻿﻿

Insurance provides policyholders with protection against losses stemming from a variety of <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risk.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">risks</a>, such as death, car crashes, and weather. Insured parties pay insurance companies premiums in exchange for coverage and file claims when they experience a loss. Weather insurance can cover events like festivals, weddings, concerts, trade shows, seasonal events, parades, film shoots, fundraisers, and sporting events.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4">﻿</span>﻿

The <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/premium.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">premium</a> for weather insurance is based on several factors, including the location and time of year. In other words, the dollar amount clients are charged for coverage is determined by the likelihood of the insured weather event occurring and the amount of potential loss. An <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/actuary.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">actuary</a> at the insurance company looks at weather data going back many decades to decide how to price a policy. If, for example, Cleveland gets a white Christmas every 10 years, then the insurer knows that the probability of such an event is 10%.

Businesses sometimes even use these policies as a sales gimmick to lure in customers. For instance, a furniture store may advertise that all buyers of furniture in December will get their purchases free if it snows more than two inches on Christmas. In such cases, the store would buy a policy to cover this specific event.

Weather insurance is a necessity for many companies and is considered to be a key <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskmanagement.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">risk management</a> strategy. It’s also highly customizable. For example, an insured party can choose the number of days, weather events, and severity of weather that will be covered by the policy.

Weather influences our daily lives and can have a huge impact on corporate revenues and <a class="pseudoStyle" data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earnings.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">earnings</a>. Until recently, insurance has been the main tool used by companies for protection against unexpected weather conditions. The problem is that conventional insurance usually only provides coverage for <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/catastrophe-insurance.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">catastrophic damage</a> and does nothing to protect against the reduced demand businesses experience as a result of weather that is warmer or colder than expected.

Enter <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/weatherderivative.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">weather derivatives</a>. In the late 1990s, people began to realize if they quantified and indexed weather in terms of monthly or seasonal average temperatures and attached a dollar amount to each <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/index.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">index</a> value, they could "package" and trade weather. The very first transaction of the sort was conducted in 1997 in a power contract by Aquila Energy.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5">﻿</span>﻿﻿ From here, the weather became a tradable <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commodity.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">commodity</a>, comparable to trading the varying values of stock indices, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="4" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currency.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">currencies</a>, interest rates, and agricultural commodities began to take shape. 

The seller of a weather derivative agrees to bear the risk of disasters in return for a premium. That means that if no damages occur before the expiration of the contract, they end up making a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profit.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">profit</a>.

Weather derivatives usually cover low-risk, high-probability events. Weather insurance, on the other hand, typically protects against high-risk, low-probability occurrences, as defined in a highly customized policy. Because weather insurance and derivatives deal with two different possibilities, a company might have an interest in purchasing both.

Let's say an event planner is organizing an outdoor festival for a weekend in the summer. The organizer sets the date and is unsure about whether weather conditions will cooperate. Although they sell tickets, the event organizer also expects to earn revenue from sales. In order to make sure there are no hiccups during the festival, the organizer decides to take out a weather insurance policy. If the festival gets bogged down by rain, the organizer can file an <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurance_claim.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">insurance claim</a> with the insurance company to make up lost revenue, provided premiums are paid up.
