Relative value is a method of determining an asset's worth that takes into account the value of similar assets. This is in contrast with <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/absolute-value.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">absolute value</a>, which looks only at an asset's <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intrinsicvalue.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">intrinsic value</a> and does not compare it to other assets. The <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-earningsratio.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">price-to-earnings ratio</a> (P/E ratio) is a popular valuation method that can be used to measure the relative value of stocks.

Value investors examine the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-statements.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">financial statements</a> of competing companies before deciding where to invest their money. They look at relevant footnotes, management commentary, and economic data to assess the stock's value relative to its peers.

Steps in relative valuation may include:

Investors must always choose among the investments that are actually available at any given time, and relative valuation helps them to do that. By 2019, it was easy to look back at the prices of most U.S. stocks in 2009 and realize that they were undervalued. However, that does not help one to choose better investments today. That is where a relative valuation method like the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapgdp.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">stock market capitalization-to-GDP ratio</a> shines. The <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/worldbank.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">World Bank</a> maintains data on stock market capitalization as a percentage of GDP for many nations covering several decades.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿ With U.S. stocks near record highs in terms of stock market capitalization as a percentage of GDP in 2019, stocks in most other countries were relatively inexpensive.

The primary flaw of relative valuation is that it may condemn investors to making the best of a bad situation. When limited to a single <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetclasses.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">asset class</a>, relative valuation can do little more than reduce losses in extreme circumstances. For example, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valuefund.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">value funds</a> generally did much better than the S&amp;P 500 during the 2000-2002 <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearmarket.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">bear market</a>. Unfortunately, most of them still lost money.

Relative valuation is one of two important methods of placing a monetary value on a company; the other is intrinsic valuation. Investors might be familiar with the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discounted Cash Flows</a> (DCF) method for determining the intrinsic value of a company. While relative valuation incorporates many multiples, a DCF model uses a company’s future free cash flow projections and discounts them. That is achieved by using a required annual rate. Eventually, an analyst will arrive at a present value estimate, which can then be used to evaluate the potential for investment. If the DCF value is higher than the cost of the investment, the opportunity may be a good one.

Consider the following table of financial information comparing Microsoft to other technology firms.

Based on the above relative value analysis results, Microsoft is overvalued relative to Oracle. However, Microsoft is also undervalued relative to VMware.
