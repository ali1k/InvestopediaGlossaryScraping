The profit and loss (P&amp;L) statement is a financial statement that summarizes the revenues, costs, and expenses incurred during a specified period, usually a fiscal quarter or year. The P&amp;L statement is synonymous with the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incomestatement.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">income statement</a>.

These records provide information about a company's ability or inability to generate profit by increasing revenue, reducing costs, or both. Some refer to the P&amp;L statement as a statement of profit and loss, income statement, statement of operations, statement of financial results or income, earnings statement, or expense statement.

For non-profit organizations, revenues and expenses are generally tracked in a financial report called the statement of activities (sometimes called statement of financial activities or statement of support).

P&amp;L management refers to how a company handles its P&amp;L statement through revenue and cost management.

The P&amp;L statement is one of three financial statements every public company issues quarterly and annually, along with the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancesheet.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">balance sheet</a> and the cash flow statement. It is often the most popular and common financial statement in a business plan as it quickly shows how much profit or loss was generated by a business.

The income statement, like the cash flow statement, shows changes in accounts over a set period. The balance sheet, on the other hand, is a snapshot, showing what the company owns and owes at a single moment. It is important to compare the income statement with the cash flow statement since, under the accrual method of accounting, a company can log revenues and expenses before cash changes hands.

The income statement follows a general form as seen in the example below. It begins with an entry for revenue, known as the top line, and subtracts the costs of doing business, including the cost of goods sold, operating expenses, tax expenses, and interest expenses. The difference, known as the bottom line, is <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/netincome.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">net income</a>, also referred to as profit or earnings. You can find many templates for creating a personal or business P&amp;L statement online for free.

It is important to compare income statements from different accounting periods, as the changes in revenues, operating costs, research and development spending, and net earnings over time are more meaningful than the numbers themselves. For example, a company's revenues may grow, but its expenses might grow at a faster rate.

One can use the income statement to calculate several metrics, including the gross profit margin, the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operatingmargin.asp">operating profit margin</a>, the net profit margin, and the operating ratio. Together with the balance sheet and cash flow statement, the income statement provides an in-depth look at a company's financial performance.

A P&amp;L statement is one of the three types of financial statements prepared by companies, the other two being the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancesheet.asp">balance sheet</a> and the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashflowstatement.asp">cash flow statement</a>. The purpose of the P&amp;L statement is to show the revenues and expenditures of the company over a specified period of time, usually one fiscal year.

Using this information, investors and analysts can assess the profitability of the company, often combining this information with insights from the other two financial statements. For instance, an investor might calculate a company’s <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnonequity.asp">return on equity (ROE)</a> by comparing its <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/netincome.asp">net income</a> (as shown on the P&amp;L) to its level of <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholdersequity.asp">shareholder’s equity</a> (as shown on the balance sheet).

Whereas the P&amp;L shows the income, expenditures, and profitability of a company over a period of time, the balance sheet provides a snapshot of the company’s assets and liabilities as of a certain date. Typically, the balance sheet is presented as of the last day of the company’s fiscal year. Investors use the balance sheet to understand the financial strength of the company, comparing the amount and quality of its assets against its liabilities.

Publicly traded companies are required to prepare P&amp;L statements and must file their financial statements with the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp">Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</a> so that they can be scrutinized by investors, analysts, and regulators. In preparing these statements, public companies must comply with a set of rules and guidelines known as <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gaap.asp">generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)</a>.

Private companies, on the other hand, are not necessarily required to comply with GAAP, and some smaller companies may even not prepare formal financial statements at all.
