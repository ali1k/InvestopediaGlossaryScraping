The term Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA) refers to a government-owned corporation responsible for managing the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sovereign_wealth_fund.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">sovereign wealth fund</a> of Kuwait. Founded out of the Kuwait Investment Board in 1982, it was established to manage government <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/revenue.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">revenue</a>, derived primarily from the excess proceeds Kuwait earns from its <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/oil-reserves.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">oil reserves</a>. The fund—the world's first and oldest—was created to lessen the country's dependence on oil.

<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/crude-oil.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crude oil</a> was first discovered in Kuwait in 1938. The country exported its first shipment of the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commodity.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">commodity</a> in 1946, which put Kuwait on the map as one of the world's major crude oil producers.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ This boosted the country's <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economy.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">economy</a>, leading its leaders to look for ways to invest its excess revenue.

Sheikh Abdullah Al-Salem Al-Sabah created the Kuwait Investment Board in 1953—eight years before the country’s independence.﻿ The board was established to manage the nation's <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/surplus.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">surplus</a> oil revenue. It also aimed to decrease Kuwait's dependence on a single resource. This paved the road for the creation of the Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA) in 1982 as an autonomous government body in charge of managing the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">assets</a> of the country.﻿<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2">﻿</span>﻿﻿﻿ The KIA is located in Kuwait City, with additional offices in London and Shanghai.﻿﻿﻿﻿<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9">﻿</span>﻿﻿

The KIA, which created the world's very first and oldest sovereign wealth fund, is managed by a board of directors. This board has the authority and independence over the fund's <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetallocation.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">asset allocation</a> strategy. It is also responsible for the fund's performance. The fund invests mostly in <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/030415/difference-between-private-and-public-equity.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">private and public equity</a>, real estate, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixedincome.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">fixed income</a>, and alternative investment markets. According to the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute, the KIA has a total of $533.6 billion in assets.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5">﻿</span>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿

There are three different principles that make up the KIA's <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/missionstatement.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">mission statement</a>:

The fund is one of the members of the International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds and is among those that signed up to the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gaap-santiagoprinciples.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Santiago Principles</a>, which consists of 24 <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/best_practices.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">best practices</a> for these types of funds.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10">﻿</span>﻿﻿<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7">﻿</span>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ The principles aim to promote <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accountability.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">accountability</a> and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="4" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/transparency.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">transparency</a>, along with sound investment decisions among the world's sovereign wealth funds.

The fund is divided into two segments—the General Reserve Fund (GRF) and the Future Generations Fund (FGF). The country’s oil revenues and any income earned from the fund's investments are held in the GRF.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6">﻿</span>﻿﻿﻿ Its assets and income may be freely used by the national government. This segment invests in domestic companies, along with corporations in other Middle Eastern and Northern African countries. As much as 10% of the country's revenue and 10% of the GRF's <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/netincome.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">net income</a> are transferred to the Future Generations Fund.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9">﻿</span>﻿﻿

The FGF is considered an intergenerational, long-term saving platform. This segment, established in 1976, was created with a 50% <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/transfer.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">transfer</a> from the GRF. The fund invests outside of Kuwait with strategic asset allocation. All income from FGF’s investments is <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reinvestment.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">reinvested</a>. Any transfers from the fund require a specific legislation.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11">﻿</span>﻿
