A voucher check is a combination of a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/check.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">check</a> and a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/voucher.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">voucher</a>, also known as "remittance advice," which includes pertinent information about the parties to the transaction and thus creates an auditable paper trail about that check's payment.

The voucher check creates a paper trail for the payment by the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/issuer.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">issuer</a> of the check. The recipient of the voucher check detaches one voucher part and retains it for record-keeping before cashing the check. The issuer retains the other voucher portion.

Voucher checks that are used in computerized accounting systems have three parts that together fit on standard-sized sheets of paper for ease of use in printers. The checks are usually business sized—longer than a standard check but with the same width. One part is the check and the other two parts are the vouchers for the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/payee.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">payee</a> and issuer for their respective records. Perforations make the different sections easy to separate.

A voucher is a document used by a company’s <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accountspayable.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">accounts payable</a> department to gather and file all of the supporting documents needed to approve and track the payment of a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liability.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">liability</a>. A voucher is essentially the backup documents for accounts payable, invoicing, or payroll. (Accounts payable are the short-term bills owed by companies to vendors and suppliers.) The voucher is important because it is an internal <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accounting-control.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">accounting control</a> mechanism that ensures that every payment is properly authorized and that the goods or services purchased are actually received.

Voucher checks are commonly used by a company's payroll department and are referred to as payroll checks. The voucher will contain a voucher number, name of the payee, date, amount (gross and net if any deductions), signatures, and any memo notes that need to be recorded. For <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/payroll.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">payroll</a>, even though direct deposit is increasingly becoming the norm for paying employees, having a paper trail back-up is a common practice.

<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vendor.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vendors</a> also use voucher checks. In this instance, a voucher check is issued when an <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/invoice.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">invoice</a> is matched with a purchase order and documentation that the order was filled. In addition, for the accounts payable department, having a file of voucher records of payments to vendors is helpful in resolving payment disputes and in preparing books for internal month-end closings.
