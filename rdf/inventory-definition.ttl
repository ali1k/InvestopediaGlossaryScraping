Inventory is the term for the goods available for sale and raw materials used to produce goods available for sale. Inventory represents one of the most important <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">assets</a> of a business because the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inventoryturnover.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">turnover of inventory</a> represents one of the primary sources of revenue generation and subsequent earnings for the company's shareholders.

Inventory is the array of finished goods or goods used in production held by a company. Inventory is classified as a current asset on a company's <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancesheet.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">balance sheet</a>, and it serves as a buffer between <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ism-mfg.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">manufacturing</a> and order fulfillment. When an inventory item is sold, its carrying cost transfers to the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cogs.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">cost of goods sold</a> (COGS) category on the income statement.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"></span>

Inventory can be valued in three ways. The <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fifo.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">first-in, first-out (FIFO)</a> method says that the cost of goods sold is based on the cost of the earliest purchased materials, while the carrying cost of remaining inventory is based on the cost of the latest purchased materials. The <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lifo.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">last-in, first-out (LIFO)</a> method states that the cost of goods sold is valued using the cost of the latest purchased materials, while the value of the remaining inventory is based on the earliest purchased materials.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿ <span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2">﻿</span>﻿ The weighted average method requires valuing both <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gmroi.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">inventory</a> and the cost of goods sold based on the average cost of all materials bought during the period.

Many producers partner with retailers to consign their inventory. Consignment inventory is the inventory owned by the supplier/producer (generally a wholesaler) but held by a customer (generally a retailer). The customer then purchases the inventory once it has been sold to the end customer or once they consume it (e.g. to produce their own products). The benefit to the supplier is that their product is promoted by the customer and readily accessible to end-users. The benefit to the customer is that they do not expend capital until it proves profitable to them, meaning they only purchase it when the end-user purchases it from them or until they consume the inventory for their operations.

Inventory is generally categorized as raw materials, work-in-progress, and finished goods.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿ Raw materials are unprocessed materials used to produce a good. Examples of <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rawmaterials.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">raw materials</a> include aluminum and steel for the manufacture of cars, flour for bakeries production of bread, and crude oil held by refineries.

<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/workinprogress.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Work-in-progress</a> inventory is the partially finished goods waiting for completion and resale; work-in-progress inventory is otherwise known as inventory on the production floor. For example, a half-assembled airliner or a partially completed yacht would be work-in-process.

Finished goods are products that have completed production and are ready for sale. Retailers typically refer to this inventory as "merchandise.” Common examples of merchandise include electronics, clothes, and cars held by retailers.

Possessing a high amount of inventory for a long time is usually not advantageous for a business because of storage costs, spoilage costs, and the threat of obsolescence. However, possessing too little inventory also has its disadvantages; for example, the business runs the risk of market share erosion and losing profit from potential sales. <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inventory-management.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inventory management</a> forecasts and strategies, such as a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jit.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">just-in-time (JIT)</a> inventory system (with <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/backflush-costing.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">backflush costing</a>), can help minimize inventory costs because goods are created or received only when needed.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4">﻿</span>﻿
