IRS Publication 590, entitled "Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)," refers to an IRS document that outlines rules for <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ira.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">individual retirement accounts</a> (IRAs).

IRS Publication 590 also provides information on penalties that taxpayers might face if IRA regulations are not followed properly.

IRS Publication 590 has two parts. <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" href="https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-publication-590-a" rel="noopener noreferrer">Part A</a> covers contributions to individual retirement arrangements, and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" href="https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-publication-590-b" rel="noopener noreferrer">Part B</a> covers distributions from individual retirement arrangements.

IRS Publication 590 often outlines new rules or provisions, such as those that offer relief to disaster victims. For example, in the tax year 2017, it named a qualified disaster tax relief provision that covers "tax-favored withdrawals and repayments from certain retirement plans for taxpayers who suffered economic losses" as a result of Hurricane and Tropical Storm Harvey, as well as Hurricanes Irma and Maria, and the California wildfires.

Other items for 2017 included:

In 2018, there were increases to the AGI limits across the board, as well as an extended rollover period for certain plan loan offsets and a disclosure disallowing <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/recharacterization.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">recharacterization</a> of conversions made in 2018 or later.
