A mortgage recast, also called a loan recast, is a feature of some types of mortgages where remaining monthly payments are recalculated based on a new <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/amortization_schedule.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">amortization schedule</a>. During a mortgage recast, the borrower pays a large sum toward their <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/principal.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">principal</a>, and their mortgage is then recalculated based on the new, lower balance outstanding.

Some mortgages have a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/scheduledrecast.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">scheduled recast date</a>, which is the date when the lender will calculate a new amortization schedule based on the mortgage's remaining principal balance and term.

For the borrower, the primary benefit of recasting a mortgage is to reduce monthly payments. Often, a mortgage lender will simply reduce the term of a loan if extra principal payments are made, but maintain the same fixed monthly amount due—simply by increasing the principal amount and reducing the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interest.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">interest</a> portion of the payment.

Recasting can lower the amount of interest the borrower will pay over the life of the loan if a sufficiently large principal payment is made, reducing both the interest and principal remaining on the loan's new monthly payments.

A mortgage recast can be a more comfortable option than <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/refinance.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">refinancing</a>. With a refinance, you replace your current mortgage with a new mortgage loan, which can be costly and depends on your <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditrating.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">credit standing</a>. A mortgage recast does not involve a credit check and continues with the original mortgage.

On the other hand, refinancing a mortgage means paying off the existing loan and replacing it with a new one. Reasons why homeowners refinance include:

Mortgage recasting can be written into the loan terms and is associated with a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/negativelyamortizingloan.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">negative amortization loan</a>. A negatively amortizing loan has a payment structure that allows for a scheduled payment that is less than the loan's interest charge.

When a payment is less than the interest charge at the time, it creates <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deferredinterest.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">deferred interest</a>. The amount of deferred interest created is added to the principal balance of the loan, leading to a situation where the principal owed increases over time instead of decreasing. Due to this increasing principal, negative amortization mortgages require that the loan is recast at some point so that it will be paid off by the end of its scheduled term. 

Negative amortization mortgages also sometimes have <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/recast_trigger.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">triggers</a> that might cause an unscheduled recast to occur. This may kick in, for example, if the principal balance of the loan reaches a set limit through negative amortization.

Negative amortization mortgages are also known as payment <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option_arm.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">option adjustable-rate mortgages</a> (Option ARM). These mortgages give borrowers options that include paying all of the principal and interest or paying only some of the interest.

While the choices available with an option ARM allow for more flexibility on payments, the borrower could easily end up with more long-term debt than before. As with other <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/arm.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">adjustable-rate mortgages</a>, there is the possibility of interest rates changing drastically and rapidly based on the market.

Even if a mortgage does not have a recast option included, you can approach your lender to see if a mortgage recast will benefit you and lower your monthly payments. By paying a lump sum and recasting your mortgage, you can reduce your housing costs. By contrast, if you submit a lump sum without recasting, you lower your balance but your monthly payments will remain the same.

Let's say you have a $500,000, 30-year <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixed-rate_mortgage.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">fixed-rate mortgage</a> with a 4% interest rate. Your combined interest and principal payment are $2,338 per month.

After five years, you receive a windfall lump sum of $375,000. If you decided to use that lump sum to pay down the mortgage without recasting it, you would continue to pay $2,338 a month. If, on the other hand, you recast the loan over the remaining 25 years of the mortgage, the monthly payment would go down to $1,507.
