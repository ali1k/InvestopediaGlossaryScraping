Taxpayers eligible to classify themselves as an HOH get higher standard deductions and lower tax rates than taxpayers who file as single or married filing separately.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿﻿ 

HOH is a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/filingstatus.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">filing status</a> available to taxpayers who meet certain qualifying thresholds. They must file separate individual tax returns, be considered unmarried, and be entitled to an <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exemption.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">exemption</a> for a qualifying person, such as a child or parent. Further, the HOH must pay more than one-half the cost of supporting the qualifying person and more than one-half the cost of maintaining that qualifying person’s primary home.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿﻿﻿﻿

To be considered unmarried, the HOH must be single, divorced, or considered unmarried. Married taxpayers would be regarded as unmarried if they did not live with their spouse during the last six months of the tax year.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿﻿﻿﻿ The status is further reliant on the head of household meeting either of these two requirements.

An HOH must pay for more than one-half of the cost of a qualifying person’s support and housing costs. The HOH must also pay more than one-half of the rent or mortgage, utilities, repairs, insurance, taxes, and other costs of maintaining the home where the qualifying person lives for more than half the year. The home must be the taxpayer’s own home unless the qualifying person is the taxpayer’s parent and the home is the property of that parent.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿﻿﻿﻿ 

Since the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/taxes/trumps-tax-reform-plan-explained/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017</a> the personal exemption has been suspended through 2025.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿﻿﻿﻿ Back when there was one, HOH filers had to be able to claim an exemption for their qualifying person. Taxpayers could release their exemption to a noncustodial parent in a divorce proceeding or a legal separation agreement and remain eligible to file as an HOH.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4">﻿</span>﻿﻿﻿﻿

Filing as an HOH can provide significant savings for taxpayers. The 2019 and 2020 tax rate for individuals earning $50,000 and filing as an HOH is 12%.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6">﻿</span>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8">﻿</span>﻿﻿﻿ Compare the tax burden shown below for an individual earning $50,000 using the different filing statuses.

Filing as an HOH, the individual will pay 10% of $14,100, or $1,410, plus 12% of the amount over $14,100 ($35,900 x 12% = $4,308) for a total tax of $5,718.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8">﻿</span>﻿

A taxpayer filing single or married filing separately will pay 10% of the first $9,875, or $987.50, plus 12% of $40,125 - $9,875, or $3,630, plus 22% of $50,000 - $40,125, or $2,172.50. This brings the total tax to $987.50 + $3,630 + $2,172.50 = $6,790.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7">﻿</span>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿

Thus, filing as an HOH saved this hypothetical taxpayer $1,072.
