The OTC Markets Group is the owner and operator of the most substantial U.S. inter-dealer electronic quotation and trading system for <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otc.asp">over-the-counter (OTC)</a> securities. It provides marketplaces for trading more than 10,000 OTC securities

The company provides services in three core areas that are essential for better-informed and more efficient financial markets. The fields are Trading Services, Market Data, and Corporate Services.

OTC Markets Group was preceded by the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/national-quote-bureau.asp">National Quotation Bureau</a> which was founded in 1913. Prior to being called the OTC Markets Group Inc., the National Quotation Bureau renamed itself Pink Sheets LLC in 2000 and then Pink OTC Markets in 2008. The change to the OTC Markets Group name came in 2010.

The handling of most OTC securities trading in the U.S. is on the company’s OTC Link platform, an alternative trading system registered with the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp">Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</a> as a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/broker-dealer.asp">broker-dealer</a>. OTC Markets Group has its headquarters in New York City and is publicly traded on the OTCQX marketplace under the symbol OTCM. 

Through the Trading services division, OTC Markets Group connects broker-dealers together which provides the liquidity and infrastructure for executing trades on the OTC market.

The Market Data division provides data and quote services for the more than 10,000 OTC securities.

The Corporate Services division helps companies go public and gain greater visibility through listing in one of OTC Markets Group's three OTC tiers.

The most visible aspect of the OTC Markets Group's stewardship is the breakdown of the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/over-the-countermarket.asp">OTC market</a> into three tiers, based on the quality and quantity of the listed companies’ information and disclosures. This tiered structure provides different levels of transparency, so investors know what types of information they do and do not have for each company they wish to trade.

With more than 10,600 securities listed by the OTC Markets Group as of May 2019, daily trading <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volume.asp">volume</a> fluctuates. Dollar trade volume typically exceeds $1 billion per day, share volume will often reach five billion or higher, and the number of trades will often be north of 150,000. These stats are for all three tiers combined.

The OTC Pink is the largest tier in terms of the number of companies listed within it. It also typically accounts for about 70% of the daily trading volume mentioned above.
