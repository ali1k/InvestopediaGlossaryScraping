Chenault worked with American Express in a number of different areas since he joined the company in 1981. He became president of the consumer card group in 1989, then assumed the role of president of travel-related services in 1993. Two years later, he was named vice president chairman of the company.

In the fall of 2017, Chenault announced that he was leaving American Express in February 2018.

Chenault joined the boards of several companies, including Airbnb (<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=ABNB" rel="noopener noreferrer">ABNB</a>) and Berkshire Hathaway (<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=BRK.A" rel="noopener noreferrer">BRK.A</a>/<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=BRK.B" rel="noopener noreferrer">BRK.B</a>).

In 2008, with the global <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-crisis.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">credit crisis</a>, American Express was facing headwinds as the world was contracting. The <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalreservesystem.asp/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Federal Reserve System</a> approved the company's application to become a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/one-bank-holding-company.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">bank holding company</a>. This allowed American Express to receive emergency financing from the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="4" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/troubled-asset-relief-program-tarp.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">TARP program</a>.

During his time at the helms of American Express, Chenault also helped increase the company's <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketshare.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">market share</a> by expanding its customer base. Chenault achieved this by offering <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditcard.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">credit cards</a> in addition to <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/chargecard.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">charge cards</a> and adding membership rewards programs.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7">﻿</span>﻿

Chenault often addresses the need for diversity in the corporate world, citing <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/upper-management.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">upper management's</a> lack of seeking out diverse candidates rather than there being a lack of talent.
