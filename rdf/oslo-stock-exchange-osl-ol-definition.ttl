The Oslo Stock Exchange (OSL) .OL is the major securities trading market based in Oslo, Norway. In Norwegian, the market is known as Oslo Børs.

The Oslo Stock Exchange (OSL) .OL, known in Norwegian as Oslo Børs, is the major <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockmarket.asp">stock market</a> in Norway. It is Norway’s only regulated securities exchange. Although companies listed on the exchange operate in diverse industries, a majority of those listed participate in industries such as banking, oil and gas, biotechnology and marine industries.

While a majority of the securities traded on the Oslo Stock Exchange are Norwegian public limited companies, foreign companies also participate in the exchange. Companies which apply to be listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange must meet certain requirements and must disclose data regarding ownership and history, shares and market value.

Originally established in 1818, the primary function of the exchange was to serve as a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commoditiesexchange.asp">commodity exchange</a>, fixing prices on a monthly basis. It was not until 1881 that Oslo Børs became an official stock exchange and began to list and trade securities. Today, the Oslo Stock Exchange trades in a full range of financial products, including equities, bonds, derivatives, equity certificates, ETPs, fixed income products and more.

The Oslo Stock Exchange became a fully-electronic trading system in 1999. As of 2007, the Oslo Stock Exchange is owned by Oslo Børs VPS Holding ASA.

As part of an effort for Nordic exchanges to attract more international investment, in 2002, the Oslo Stock Exchange joined the NOREX alliance. NOREX also includes the stock exchanges of <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockholmstockexchange.asp">Stockholm</a>, Copenhagen and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockholmstockexchange.asp">Iceland</a>, and provides a common trading platform and streamlined regulations for participants.

The Oslo Stock Exchange offers investors the opportunity to invest in the OBX Index, which comprises the 25 most-traded securities on the exchange. The OBX Index is revised twice per year, based on the market data on the first Monday after the third Friday each June and December.

In addition to the Oslo Stock Exchange, Oslo Børs VPS Holding ASA facilitates trading four other marketplaces, including Oslo Axess, Merkur Market, Nordic ABM and Oslo Connect.

Oslo Axess was established in 2007 as a regulated, licensed market under the Oslo Exchange, intended to promote the growth of small companies that do not yet meet requirements for listing on the Oslo Stock Exchange.

Merkur Market launched in 2016 as a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/multilateral_trading_facility.asp">multilateral trading facility</a> for small and medium enterprises, which provides the opportunity for privately-held limited companies and equivalent foreign counterparts to be traded in Oslo. Boasting one of the fastest admission processes in Europe, Merkur Market indicates that a qualified applicant can be trading in their marketplace in as little as two weeks.

In 2005, the Oslo Stock Exchange established Nordic ABM as an alternative bond market. While Nordic ABM is not a regulated market or multilateral trading facility, Oslo Stock Exchange sets the rules, fees and registration process for bonds which request to be registered on the Nordic ABM.

Oslo Connect is an OTC <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/derivative.asp">derivatives</a> marketplace which is regulated as a multilateral trading facility. Participants in Oslo Connect must sign an agreement with Oslo Børs and a cooperating <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/clearinghouse.asp">clearing house</a>.
