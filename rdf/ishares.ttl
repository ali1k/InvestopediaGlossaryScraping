A global leader in <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">exchange-traded funds</a> (ETFs), iShares has nearly $2 trillion invested in more than 800 different product offerings across a wide range of asset classes and investment strategies. iShares is a subsidiary BlackRock, the world's largest asset management company, and BlackRock is responsible for issuing and marketing iShares products.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8">﻿</span>﻿ <span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7">﻿</span>﻿

Founded in the year 2000, the initial iShares listings were established on major exchanges such as the NYSE Euronext, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cboe.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chicago Board Options Exchange</a>, Nasdaq and NYSE Arca.

ETFs from iShares are a flexible, low-cost way for investors to gain exposure to various market segments, including fixed income, emerging markets and broad-based indexes. For example, the iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF (<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=ivv" rel="noopener noreferrer">IVV</a>) tracks the S&amp;P 500 Index, whereas the iShares MSCI Emerging Market ETF (<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=eem" rel="noopener noreferrer">EEM</a>) follows more than 800 large and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/midcapstock.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">mid-cap</a> companies in developing countries.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿ <span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5">﻿</span>﻿

By combining low fees with tax efficiency in an asset that seeks to match an index, ETFs can build greater longer term savings compared with mutual funds. Beyond savings, most ETFs aim to match the performance of a benchmark index, which means turnover is less frequent and thus fees are lower. However, this doesn't come at the expense of performance. In fact, iShares Core ETFs have outperformed more than 75% of their peers on average over the past five years.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6">﻿</span>﻿   

Almost all major global marketplaces list iShares funds, including the London Stock Exchange, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the Toronto Stock Exchange, among others. At any given time, iShares and Vanguard represent more than 50% of the total ETF market.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9">﻿</span>﻿

For U.S. investors, iShares offers nearly 380 ETFs focused on commodities, equities, fixed income, multi assets and real estate. In addition, investors can choose to focus on developing, emerging or <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/frontier-market.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">frontier markets</a>; specific regions and individual countries; industry sectors; megatrends such as climate change, demographic change and technological breakthroughs; thematic investing such as <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/environmental-social-and-governance-esg-criteria.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) criteria</a>; and other selection methodologies.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4">﻿</span>﻿ Below are some popular products under the iShares brand:
