The Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 requires large companies to file notifications with the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/ftc.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Federal Trade Commission</a> and the anti-trust division of Department of Justice prior to certain <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mergersandacquisitions.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">mergers and acquisitions</a> or tender offers.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2">﻿</span>﻿

The law requires companies intending to <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/merger.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">merge</a> to file an HSR Form, also called a "Notification and Report Form for Certain Mergers and Acquisitions" and generally known as a premerger notification report.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4">﻿</span>﻿ This gives regulators an opportunity to review the proposed merger based on <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/antitrust.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">antitrust laws</a>.

President Gerald Ford signed the act into law as a set of amendments to existing antitrust laws, including the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/clayton-antitrust-act.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clayton Antitrust Act</a>.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿ The Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 is also known as the "HSR Act" or Public Law 94-435.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿

Once companies file the required forms, a waiting period begins. The waiting period is usually 30 days, or 15 days for cash <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tenderoffer.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">tender offers</a> or an acquisition in <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bankruptcy.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">bankruptcy</a>.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7">﻿</span>﻿

The transaction can proceed once the waiting period ends or if the government terminates the waiting period early. If regulators see potential anti-competitive issues with the proposed merger, they will request additional information from the companies involved and extend the waiting period; they will negotiate an agreement with the companies to enact measures to restore competition; or they will seek to stop the transaction by filing a preliminary <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/injunction.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">injunction</a> in court.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7">﻿</span>﻿

Under the HSR Act, the following tests must be met to require a pre-merger filing:

For 2020, the base filing threshold for the HSR Act, which determines whether a transaction requires a premerger notification, is $904 million. The statutory size-of-person threshold is between $18.8 million and $188 million. Alternatively, the statutory transaction size test that applies to all transactions (even if the "size-of-person" threshold is not met) is $376 million.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6">﻿</span>﻿ 

HSR forms carry a filing fee that varies depending on the size of a transaction. For example, transactions worth more than $94 million but less than $188 million require a $45,000 filing fee. Transactions valued at more than $188 million but less than $940.1 million incur a $125,000 filing fee. The filing fee is $280,000 for transactions greater than $940.1 million.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5">﻿</span>﻿
