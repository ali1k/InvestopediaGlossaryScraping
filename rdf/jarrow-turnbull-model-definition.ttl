The Jarrow Turnbull model is one of the first reduced-form models for pricing <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditrisk.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">credit risk</a>. Developed by Robert Jarrow and Stuart Turnbull, the model utilizes <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/multifactor-model.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">multi-factor</a> and dynamic analysis of <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">interest rates</a> to calculate the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="4" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/defaultprobability.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">probability</a> of <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="5" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/default2.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">default</a>.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿

Determining credit risk, the possibility of a loss resulting from a borrower's failure to repay a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/loan.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">loan</a> or meet contractual <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/obligation.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">obligations</a> is a highly advanced field, involving both complex math and high-octane computing.

Various models exist to help <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financialinstitution.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">financial institutions</a> get a better grip on whether a firm may fail to meet its financial obligations or not. Previously, it was common to use tools that examine default risk mainly by looking at a company’s <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalstructure.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">capital structure</a>.

The Jarrow Turnbull model, introduced in the early 1990s, offered a new way to measure the likelihood of default by factoring in the impact of fluctuating interest rates, otherwise known as the cost of borrowing, as well.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿ 

Reduced-form models are one of two approaches to credit risk modeling, the other being structural. Structural models assume that the modeler has complete knowledge of a company’s <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">assets</a> and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liability.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">liabilities</a>, leading to a predictable default time.

Structural models, often called <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mertonmodel.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Merton" models</a>, after the Nobel Laureate academic <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/robert-c-merton.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Robert C. Merton</a>, are single-period models that derive their probability of default from the random variations in the unobservable value of a firm's assets. Under this model, default risks occurring at the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maturitydate.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">maturing date</a> if, at that stage, the value of a company’s assets fall below its outstanding <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="4" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debt.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">debt</a>.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2">﻿</span>﻿

Reduced-form models, on the other hand, take the view that the modeler is in the dark about the company's financial condition. These models treat defaulting as an unexpected event that can be governed by a multitude of different factors going on in the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">market</a>.

Because structural models are rather sensitive to the many assumptions underlying their design, Jarrow concluded that for pricing and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedge.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">hedging</a>, reduced-form models are the preferred methodology.

Most banks and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditrating.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">credit rating</a> agencies use a combination of structural and reduced-form models, as well as proprietary variants, to assess credit risk. Structural models offer the built-in advantage of offering a link between the credit quality of a firm and the firm’s economic and financial conditions established in Merton’s model.

Meanwhile, the Jarrow Turnbull reduced-form models utilize some of the same information but account for certain market parameters, as well as knowledge of a firm’s financial condition at a point in time.
