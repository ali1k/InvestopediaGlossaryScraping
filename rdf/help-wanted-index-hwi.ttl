The Conference Board's Help-Wanted Index (HWI) measures how efficiently employers are matching jobs to the available workforce (the unemployed) and is an important gauge on the economy.

The Conference Board, looking for a way to augment the portfolio of employment statistics, created the Help-Wanted Advertising Index in 1951.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿ The most obvious contribution made by the HWI is its measure of the changes in employment demand as represented on the classified pages of newspapers, which is considered a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leadingindicator.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">leading indicator</a> of unemployment. The arguably more meaningful contribution is the HWI's indirect measure of the slack in the job market—that is, how many jobs are going unfilled, or how efficient the job-matching process is.

When the Help-Wanted Index (HWI) is rising, it means there are a relatively large amount of positions needing to be filled. This can be interpreted as a shortage of workers. Because employers may have to raise wages to attract workers, wage inflation could ensue, which could have a negative effect on bond and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equitymarket.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">equity markets</a>.

Created first in 1951, the index totaled the lines of help-wanted classified ads from 52 leading newspapers, each from a different metropolitan statistical area around the United States.

The HWI was restructured to equal 100 in 1987 and is released to the public in a monthly press release. The Conference Board releases a national number for the HWI, along with regional numbers representing nine segments of the country, and a percentage number representing the proportion of the labor market with rising want-ad volume. The current HWI report can be found on the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" href="https://www.conference-board.org/data/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Conference Board's website</a>.

The Conference Board is composed of a board of chairmen and trustees and its voting members.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2">﻿</span>﻿ Most recently, these positions were filled by many high-ranking executives from corporations including Deutsche Bank, BBVA, Deere &amp; Company, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Monsanto, MasterCard, General Electric, Novartis, and State Farm Insurance.
