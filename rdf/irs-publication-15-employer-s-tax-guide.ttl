IRS Publication 15: Employer's Tax Guide is a document published by the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irs.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Internal Revenue Service</a> detailing an employer's responsibilities for filing and reporting tax information. The document covers the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/withholdingtax.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">withholding</a>, depositing, reporting, paying, and correcting of taxes for employees (although not for the corporation itself). IRS Publication 15 is also referred to as Circular E.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿

IRS Publication 15 is used to determine <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federal_income_tax.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">federal income tax</a>, but not state or <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/localtax.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">local taxes</a>. The Tax Guide details federal income tax amounts for payroll withholdings, including <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/medicare.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Medicare</a> and Social Security amounts.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4">﻿</span>﻿ Employers should refer to their state's tax rules to ensure that proper state income tax amounts are withheld from employees' paychecks. Extra tax information is also available in IRS Publication 15-A.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5">﻿</span>﻿

Previously, one of the most important features contained in the Employer’s Tax Guide was the Percentage Method Tables and Wage Bracket Method Tables for Income Tax Withholding.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6">﻿</span>﻿ However, for the 2020 Employer's Tax Guide, these withholding tables have been removed. These tables—and the employer instructions on how to figure employee withholding—are now included in Publication 15-T, Federal Income Tax Withholding Methods. The IRS also provides an assistant on their website, called the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" href="https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/income-tax-withholding-assistant-for-employers" rel="noopener noreferrer">Income Tax Withholding Assistant for Employers</a>, to help employers figure out employee withholding.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8">﻿</span>﻿

These wage bracket tables help an employer to know exactly which percentage of their employees’ payroll they should be <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/withholding.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">withholding</a> for taxes every pay period in order to comply with federal tax regulations. In order to determine the tax withholding amount, an employee must also file a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/w4form.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">W-4 Form</a>, which can be updated as situations change in the employee’s life, such as a new family member.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2">﻿</span>﻿ In the event that an employee does not file a W-4, the Employer’s Tax Guide also details what amount to withhold instead.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿

The easiest way to access IRS Publication 15 is typically online through the IRS website. The Employer’s Tax Guide contains any updates and new legislative changes pertinent to employers, along with the following sections:
