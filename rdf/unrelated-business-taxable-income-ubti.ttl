Unrelated business taxable income (UBTI) is income regularly generated by a tax-exempt entity by means of taxable activities. This income is not related to the main function of the entity but is needed to generate a small portion of income.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿

As of April 23, 2020, the IRS has issued proposed guidance for calculating UBTI. The guidance gives taxpayers guidance to apply UBTI silo rules for tax exempt organizations.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8">﻿</span>﻿

The <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/internal-revenue-code.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Internal Revenue Code (IRC)</a> <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/501c.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Section 501</a> grants tax-exempt status to a variety of tax-exempt and mutually beneficial organizations.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿ However, an organization that is recognized as a tax-exempt entity, such as a nonprofit or educational organization, may be liable for tax if it engages in and derives income from unrelated business activity. The <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irs.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Internal Revenue Service (IRS)</a> defines the income generated from unrelated business activities as income from a trade or business regularly carried on, that is not substantially related to the purpose that is the basis of the organization's exemption from tax.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿

UBTI was introduced in 1950 to ensure that tax-exempt businesses competed fairly with taxable companies in profit-generating activities.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2">﻿</span>﻿ Furthermore, UBTI prevents or limits tax-exempt entities from engaging in businesses that are unrelated to their primary purposes. Most forms of <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/passiveincome.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">passive income</a>, such as <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">dividends</a>, interest income, and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalgain.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">capital gains</a> from the sale or exchange of capital assets, are not treated as UBTI.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4">﻿</span>﻿ If an investor holds an <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="4" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ira.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Individual Retirement Arrangement (IRA)</a> that simply invests in traditional equities, mutual funds, and ETFs, the UBTI rules will most likely not apply. However, if the fund generates income which qualifies as UBTI, the fund may be subject to taxation. For example, income from a restaurant business that flows into an IRA is considered taxable and subject to UBTI tax.

Some transactions that may be considered unrelated business activity include:

Income generated from eligible taxable activities are subject to an estimated tax of up to 37% on income over $12,750 (as of 2019).<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6">﻿</span>﻿ Form 990-W, "Estimated Tax on Unrelated Business Taxable Income for Tax-Exempt Organizations," is a worksheet provided by the IRS to determine the amount of estimated tax payments required.
