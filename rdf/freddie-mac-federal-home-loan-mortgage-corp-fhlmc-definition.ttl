The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. (FHLMC) is a stockholder-owned, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gse.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">government-sponsored enterprise (GSE)</a> chartered by Congress in 1970 to keep money flowing to mortgage lenders in support of homeownership and rental housing for middle-income Americans. The FHLMC, familiarly known as Freddie Mac, purchases, guarantees, and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/securitize.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">securitizes</a> mortgages to form <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mbs.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">mortgage-backed securities</a>.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿﻿

Freddie Mac was created when Congress passed the Emergency Home Finance Act in 1970. This was done in an attempt to expand the secondary mortgage market while reducing interest rate risk for banks. In 1989 Freddie Mac underwent a reorganization and was turned into a shareholder-owned company, now under the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-institutions-reform-recovery-enforcement.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act (FIRREA)</a>.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2">﻿</span>﻿﻿

Freddie Mac was created to enhance the flow of credit to different parts of the economy. <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/07/fannie-freddie.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Freddie Mac and a similar GSE, Fannie Mae</a>, securitized and guaranteed about 46% of U.S. mortgage originations in 2017.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿﻿ These GSEs do not originate or service mortgages; instead, they buy loans from mortgage lenders.

After purchasing a large number of these mortgages, they combine and sell them as mortgage-backed securities, which tend to be very liquid and carry a credit rating close to that of U.S. Treasuries.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4">﻿</span>﻿﻿ This process frees up the capital of mortgage lenders, which means they can lend that same money again.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿﻿

Freddie Mac has come under criticism because its ties to the U.S. government allow it to borrow money at interest rates lower than those available to other financial institutions. With this funding advantage, it issues large amounts of debt (known in the marketplace as “agency debt” or “agencies”), and in turn purchases and holds a huge <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/portfolio.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">portfolio</a> of mortgages known as its “retained portfolio.”

Some people believe that the size of the retained portfolio combined with the complexities of managing mortgage risk poses a great deal of <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/systematicrisk.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">systematic risk</a> to the U.S. economy. Critics have argued that the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/08/fannie-mae-freddie-mac-credit-crisis.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">unchecked growth of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae</a> led to the credit crisis of 2008 that turned into the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/great-recession.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Great Recession</a>, though others disagree.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5">﻿</span>﻿﻿

Fannie Mae (Federal National Mortgage Association or FNMA) was created in 1938 as part of an amendment to the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/national-housing-act.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Housing Act</a>. It was considered a federal government agency, and its role was to act as a secondary mortgage market that could purchase, hold, or sell loans that were insured by the Federal Housing Administration. Fannie Mae stopped being a federal government agency and became a private-public corporation under the Charter Act of 1954.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2">﻿</span>﻿﻿

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are very similar. Both are publicly traded companies that were chartered to serve a public mission. The main difference between the two comes down to the source of the mortgages they buy. Fannie Mae buys mortgage loans from major retail or commercial banks, while Freddie Mac obtains its loans from smaller banks, often called “<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/thriftbank.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">thrift banks</a>” or “savings and loan associations,” <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/041015/what-difference-between-savings-loan-company-and-bank.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">that are focused on providing banking services to communities</a>.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2">﻿</span>﻿﻿
