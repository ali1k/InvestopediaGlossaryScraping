The job openings and labor turnover survey (JOLTS) is a survey done by the United States <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bls.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> (BLS) within the Department of Labor to help measure job vacancies.

JOLTS data is published monthly and organized by region and industry and is sometimes used in conjunction with the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/helpwantedindex.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Help-Wanted Index</a> (HWI), which is published by the Conference Board, and the Department of Labor's monthly <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nonfarmpayroll.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">nonfarm payroll</a> numbers, for a more accurate reading of job market efficiency in the country.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿

The BLS collects data from employers, including retailers, manufacturers, and a variety of different offices each month.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿﻿ Respondents to the survey answer quantitative and qualitative questions about their businesses' employment trends, job openings, recruitment, hires, separations, and layoffs.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2">﻿</span>﻿﻿﻿

The number of unfilled jobs is considered an important measure of demand for workers. Meanwhile, for the purpose of the survey, job openings are defined as jobs that are open (not filled) at the end of the month. In order to be open, the position must meet three conditions:

The job openings and labor turnover survey data has many uses, not least of which is to help guide the government in the formulation of <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/12/fiscal-or-monetary-policy.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">economic policy</a> through economic research and planning. That's because the availability of unfilled jobs—the job openings rate—can give policymakers a sense regarding tightness in the jobs market. A rise in the demand for workers can (and should) drive wages higher and lead to <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wage-push-inflation.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">inflation</a>. The job openings and labor turnover survey publications also provide data that can help in the analysis of industry retention rates, business cycles, and industry-specific economic research.

For investors, the job openings and labor turnover survey can be used to confirm other data relative to jobs and employment, with a higher JOLTS number suggesting increasing demand for workers and a falling number pointing to less demand. In addition to <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/conferenceboard.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Conference Board's</a> Help-Wanted Index, the Department of Labor releases a monthly payroll report that shows the number of jobs added each month, changes in hourly earnings, and the rate of unemployment.
