The term Hungarian Forint (HUF) refers to the official and national <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currency.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">currency</a> of Hungary. The name was first used between 1868 and 1892 but modern forint was introduced in 1946.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16">﻿</span>﻿﻿<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15">﻿</span>﻿ The currency is issued and maintained by the country's <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/centralbank.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">central bank</a>, the Hungarian National Bank.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15">﻿</span>﻿ Banknotes are issued in denominations ranging from 500 to 10,000 forints while coins are minted between 5 and 200 forints.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15">﻿</span>﻿ The forint is divided into 100 <em>fillér</em>, but these coins are no longer in circulation due to high inflation.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14">﻿</span>﻿

Hungary's national and only official currency is the forint. The country's national bank, referred to by Hungarians as Magyar Nemzeti Bank, is responsible for issuing and maintaining the forint's value.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10">﻿</span>﻿ Established in 1924, the bank also controls the forint's <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currency-in-circulation.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">circulation</a>.

Forint <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/banknote.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">banknotes</a> are issued in <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/denomination.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">denominations</a> of 500, 1,000, 2,000, 5,000, 10,000, and 20,000 forints.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12">﻿</span>﻿ Coins are issued in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 200 forints.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11">﻿</span>﻿ Bills are printed by the Hungarian Banknote Printing Company while coins are minted by the Hungarian Mint.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="17">﻿</span>﻿ As mentioned above, one forint is divided into 100 <em>fillér</em>. These coins were removed from circulation in 1999.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16">﻿</span>﻿

The forint is denoted in the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreign-exchange.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">foreign exchange</a> (forex) market as Ft and is commonly referred to by its abbreviation HUF.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16">﻿</span>﻿ It is not <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pegging.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">pegged</a> to any currency and no currencies are pegged to it either.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15">﻿</span>﻿ Although the euro isn't used in the country, some merchants do take the currency—notably large hotels and merchants. The exchange rate is generally lower than most exchange offices. Change is normally given in forints.

Hungary relies on a skilled <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/12/employability-labor-force-economy.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">labor force</a> to drive its export-oriented economy. Major trading partners include Germany, Slovakia, Italy, Romania, and Austria. Top industries include car and car parts manufacturing, and producing components for radios and televisions.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6">﻿</span>﻿ According to <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/worldbank.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">World Bank</a> data, Hungary registered 4.57% <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gdp.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">gross domestic product</a> (GDP) growth in 2019 and 3.33% inflation.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5">﻿</span>﻿﻿<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4">﻿</span>﻿

Hungary joined the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/europeanunion.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">European Union</a> (EU) in 2004. The country applied 10 years earlier, and there was significant support for joining at that time. Although Hungary is preparing the adopt the euro, it hasn't set a target date to make the switch.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7">﻿</span>﻿ That's because the federal government and the central bank are reluctant to adopt the common currency. In fact, Hungary's central bank governor Gyorgy Matolcsy described the euro as a "trap" and a "strategic error."<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8">﻿</span>﻿

The <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/09/financial-crisis-review.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">2007-08 Financial Crisis</a> and the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/european-sovereign-debt-crisis.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">European sovereign debt crisis</a> put into sharp relief the dangers of joining the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eurozone.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">eurozone</a>, in which 19 of the 27 EU member countries adopted the single currency.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9">﻿</span>﻿ By giving up control of their own <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="4" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monetarypolicy.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">monetary policy</a>, countries such as Greece and Spain have been unable to devalue their currencies in order to stimulate economic growth.

In addition to Hungary, other <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/050515/why-these-european-countries-dont-use-euro.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">European countries that don't use the euro</a> include Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Poland, and Romania, though the European community is seeking more thorough economic integration.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9">﻿</span>﻿

The forint was introduced in 1946 as a way to stabilize the national economy following World War II. The name comes from the gold coins of Florence called <em>fiorino d'oro,</em> which were struck beginning in 1252 and used throughout the Austro-Hungarian empire.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13">﻿</span>﻿ The <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exchangerate.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">exchange rate</a> of the currency was relatively stable until the country adopted a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketeconomy.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">market economy</a> in the early 1990s.

Hungary experienced some of the worst bouts of <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hyperinflation.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">hyperinflation</a> of any country in the world. The acceptance of the 1920 Treaty of Trianon following World War I had a series of devastating effects on the economy, not to mention the loss of more than 70% of its pre-war territory and over 60% of its pre-war population.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿ Hyperinflation reached 35% during the 1990s.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿ The economy did make some improvements in the 2000s even though inflation was so high, the currency lost its ability to be <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/convertible-currency.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">converted</a>.

Of Hungary’s 10 largest cities prior to the War, five were incorporated by neighboring countries.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2">﻿</span>﻿ Saddled by war reparations and the loss of much of their tax base, the Hungarian currency lost almost all its <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/value.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">value</a>. At its peak in 1923, annualized <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">inflation</a> reached nearly 1,200%.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿

From 1988 and into the early 1990s, many central and eastern European countries—including Hungary—broke with the communist rule. The transition, prompted by inflation and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stagnation.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">stagnation</a>, was peaceful. The first free elections in Hungary were in 1990, and the country sought to become integrated into the rest of Europe during the early 2000s.
