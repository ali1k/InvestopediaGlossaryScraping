An exemption is a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deduction.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">deduction</a> allowed by law that reduces the amount of income that is subject to income tax. The <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irs.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Internal Revenue Service</a> (IRS) previously offered two types of exemptions: personal and dependent exemptions. But with the changes brought about by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the personal exemption is disappearing until 2025.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8">﻿</span>﻿ At the same time, the standard amount that can be deducted when filing nearly doubled.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿

The personal exemption was repealed with the 2017 reforms but was essentially replaced with higher standard deductions for both couples and individuals. This change was among many in the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/taxes/trumps-tax-reform-plan-explained/#:~:text=The%20Tax%20Cuts%20and%20Jobs,families%20will%20expire%20in%202025." rel="noopener noreferrer">Tax Cuts and Jobs Act</a>.

Personal exemptions were allowed by the IRS through the 2017 filing year, with individual tax filers able to claim $4,050 for each taxpayer, spouse, and dependent child. For example, previously a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxpayer.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">taxpayer</a> who had three allowable exemptions could have deducted $12,150 from <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxableincome.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">taxable income</a>. However, if that person earned over a certain threshold, the amount of the exemption would have been phased out and eventually eliminated.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5">﻿</span>﻿

Tax filers were only able to claim a personal exemption if that person was not claimed as a dependent on someone else's income tax return.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿ This rule set exemptions apart from deductions.

For example, imagine a college student with a job whose parents claimed him or her as a dependent on their income tax return. Because someone else claimed the student as a dependent, the student could not claim the personal exemption but could still claim the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standarddeduction.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">standard deduction</a>.

In most cases, tax filers could also claim a personal deduction for a spouse, as long as the spouse was not claimed as a dependent on another person's tax return.

In many cases, dependents are minor children of the taxpayer, but taxpayers may claim exemptions for other dependents as well. The IRS has a litmus test for determining who is considered a dependent, but in most cases, it is defined as a relative of the taxpayer (parent, child, brother, sister, aunt or uncle) who is dependent on the taxpayer for support.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6">﻿</span>﻿

The so-called child tax credit double to $2,000 per child under the new law, from $1,000 per dependent previously.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9">﻿</span>﻿

Employers withhold income tax from their employees and remit it to the IRS. However, a person who has no <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxliability.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">tax liability</a> can request an exemption from <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/withholding.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">withholding</a>. This simply means that the boss will withhold Medicare and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/socialsecurity.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Social Security</a> contributions from the person's paycheck, but will not withhold income tax.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7">﻿</span>﻿
