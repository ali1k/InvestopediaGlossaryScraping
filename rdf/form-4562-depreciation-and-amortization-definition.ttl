Form 4562: Depreciation and Amortization is an <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irs.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Internal Revenue Service</a> (IRS) form used to claim deductions for the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/depreciation.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">depreciation</a> or <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/amortization.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">amortization</a> of an asset or piece of property for tax filing purposes. 

When individuals or businesses purchase property to use in their business, the IRS does not allow them to claim the full cost as a business deduction in the first year. However, they can deduct a portion of their costs each year by claiming a depreciation deduction and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/022415/filling-out-form-4562-stepbystep.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">reporting it on IRS Form 4562</a>.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿

Individuals and businesses can claim deductions for both <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tangibleasset.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">tangible assets</a> such as a building and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intangibleasset.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">intangible assets</a> such as a patent. <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/section-179.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Section 179</a> property, which is actively used to conduct business, cannot include investment property, hotels, or property primarily held abroad.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2">﻿</span>﻿

Anyone who wants to claim the following must fill out Form 4562 and include the following:<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿

Separate forms must be filed for each business or activity for which a Form 4562 is required.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿ For example, a new form must be filled out for each depreciation or amortization <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deduction.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">deduction</a> being claimed for different properties. The IRS does not require detailed depreciation records to be attached, but taxpayers should keep such records in order to calculate the depreciation deduction.

This form does not apply to employees who wish to deduct job-related vehicle expenses.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿ That deduction has been discontinued after the passing of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿

Filers must include their name, taxpayer identification number, as well as the business activity for which the form is being filed.

Part I of the form deals with Election to Expense Certain Property Under Section 179. The deduction applies to tangible personal property like machinery or equipment and for real, qualified property. Part II outlines the special depreciation allowance and other depreciation. This section must not include listed property. Part III is reserved for <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/macrs.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">MACRS</a> depreciation. Under this, assets are assigned to a specific asset class, which has a depreciation period associated with it.

If you need more space, attach additional sheets. However, complete only one Part I in its entirety when computing your section 179 expense deduction.
