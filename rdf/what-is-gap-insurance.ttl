Gap insurance is a type of <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/auto-insurance.asp">auto insurance</a> that car owners can purchase to protect themselves against losses that can arise when the amount of compensation received from a total loss does not fully cover the amount the insured owes on the vehicle's <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financing.asp">financing</a> or lease agreement. This situation arises when the balance owed on a car loan is greater than the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bookvalue.asp">book value</a> of the vehicle.

As an example of gap insurance at work, consider John's car, which is worth $15,000. However, he still owes a total of $20,000 worth of car payments. If John's car is completely written off as a result of an accident or theft, John's <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/contractors-all-risks-car-insurance.asp">car insurance</a> policy will reimburse him with $15,000. Because John owes the car financing company $20,000, however, he will still be $5,000 short, even though he no longer has a car.

If John purchases gap insurance, the gap insurance policy would cover the $5,000 "gap," or the difference between the money received from reimbursement and the amount still owed on the car.
