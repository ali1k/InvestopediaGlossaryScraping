Form 4868: Application for Automatic Extension of Time to File U.S. Individual Income Tax Return is an Internal Revenue ServiceÂ (IRS) form for individuals who wish to extend the amount of time they have to file their tax returns.

Any extension granted by the IRS applies only to the paperwork. You must send in the amount you expect to owe by the deadline.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"></span>

A U.S. citizen or resident who wants an automatic <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/filing-extension.asp">extension</a> to file a U.S. individual income <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxreturn.asp">tax return</a> can file this form. Taxpayers in the country receive a maximum six-month extension. U.S. citizens or residents who are out of the country on the due date are allowed two extra months without Form 4868 to file their returns and pay any amount due without requesting an extension. Filing this form will grant an additional four months to the taxpayer living out of the country.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"></span> The IRS qualifies those "out of the country" as:

This short form should be completed with the individual or married couple's names, address, Social Security numbers, an estimate of total tax liability for the year, total payments already made, the remaining amount due, and the amount being paid, if any.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"></span>

The form should be filed by the tax deadline date.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"></span>
