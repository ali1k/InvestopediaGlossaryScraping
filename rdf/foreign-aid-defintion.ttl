The term foreign aid refers to any type of assistance that one country voluntarily transfers to another, which can take the form of a gift, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/grant.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">grant</a>, or loan. Most people tend to think of foreign aid as <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">capital</a>, but it can also be food, supplies, and services such as humanitarian aid and military assistance.

Broader definitions of aid include any assistance transferred across borders by religious organizations, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/13/what-is-non-government-organization.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">non-governmental organizations</a> (NGOs), and foundations. U.S. foreign aid usually refers to military and economic assistance provided by the federal government provides to other countries.

As noted above, foreign aid is any type of assistance that one country's government provides to another nation, usually from developed to developing nations. Governments may issue aid in the form of:

Governments may make agreements with the countries to which they provide assistance. For instance, a developed nation may agree to provide grants to those in need after a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0311/the-financial-effects-of-a-natural-disaster.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">natural disaster</a> or during times of conflict, whether they provide any type of capital or humanitarian aid. Or a government may agree to issue loans to an allied nation that experiences economic uncertainty with special <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/repayment.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">repayment</a> provisions.

According to the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/oecd.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development</a> (OECD), member countries contributed $152.8 billion in international aid in 2019.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2">﻿</span>﻿ This was divided into:

The United States is the most generous, according to the OECD, providing $34.6 billion in foreign aid in 2019. The remaining countries that were among the top five donors included:

The <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/united-nations-un.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">United Nations</a> (UN) calls for economically advanced countries to spend at least 0.7% of their <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gross-national-income-gni.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">gross national income</a> (GNI) on international aid.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿ Turkey, Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom are the only countries that met or exceeded this level. The total contribution of member countries, though, averaged 0.3%—much lower than the UN target.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2">﻿</span>﻿

According to Security Assistance Monitor, the Middle East and North African region received the most assistance, which amounted to more than $1.195 billion in 2018 followed by the Sub-Saharan Africa region, which received about $965 million. The countries that received the most aid that year were Afghanistan, Jordan, Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5">﻿</span>﻿

Foreign aid estimates tend to vary, given the different agencies, funding methods, and aid categories associated with U.S. foreign assistance efforts. For instance, the Congressional Research Service (CRS)—a nonpartisan organization—the country spent $46.89 billion in foreign assistance during the 2018 fiscal year. That figure amounted to 1% of the total federal budget authority.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿

Aid can be provided by governments directly or through special federal agencies. For instance, the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/united-states-aid.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">United States Agency for International Development</a> (USAID) was created in 1961 to provide civilian aid. It provides assistance with education, environment, climate change, global health, crises and conflicts, food and agriculture, water, and human rights.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4">﻿</span>﻿

Foreign aid—also commonly referred to as international aid and economic aid—isn't a new concept. The colonies were recipients of foreign military aid, particularly from France, during the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042015/what-caused-american-industrial-revolution.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">American Revolution</a>. During World War I, the U.S. government loaned the Committee for Relief in Belgium $387 million—much of which it later forgave.

U.S. foreign aid began in earnest during World War II. Before entering the war, the government began funneling funds and materials to the allied nations under the Lend-Lease program, which totaled $50.1 billion by August 1945. The United States also contributed $2.7 billion through the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), beginning in late 1943.

For the four years following 1948, the U.S. gave $13 billion in aid to countries affected by the war such as the United Kingdom, France, and West Germany through the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marshall-plan.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marshall Plan</a>. The Mutual Security Act of 1951 authorized around $7.5 billion in foreign aid per year until 1961. The amount of aid authorized by the Mutual Security Act in 1951 was approximately 2.2% of the country's <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gdp.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">gross domestic product</a> (GDP).
