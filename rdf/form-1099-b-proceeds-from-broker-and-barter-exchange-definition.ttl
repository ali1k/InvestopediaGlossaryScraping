Form 1099-B: Proceeds from Broker and Barter Exchange is a federal tax form used by brokerages and barter exchanges to record customers' gains and losses during a tax year. Individual taxpayers will receive the form from their brokers or barter exchange already filled out.

Taxpayers transfer the information from a 1099-B to <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/form-8949.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Form 8949</a> to calculate their preliminary gains and losses. The result is entered onto <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/scheduled.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Schedule D</a> of their tax return.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4">﻿</span>﻿ 

Brokers must submit a 1099-B form to the IRS as well as sending a copy directly to every customer who sold stocks, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">options</a>, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commodity.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">commodities</a>, or other securities during the tax year. The IRS requires submission of the form to serve as a record of a taxpayer’s gains or losses.

Assume, for example, you sold several stocks last year. The proceeds of the sale were $10,000. That figure will be reported to the IRS from two sources: One from the brokerage on a 1099-B and the second from you as a report of a taxable <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalgain.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">capital gain</a>.

Information on a 1099-B includes a description of each investment, the purchase date and price, the sale date and price, and the resulting gain or loss.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5">﻿</span>﻿ Commissions for these transactions are excluded.

As a taxpayer, your <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalloss.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">capital losses</a> are subtracted from any capital gains and may be used to reduce the taxable income you report. There are limits to the amount of <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/100515/heres-how-deduct-your-stock-losses-your-tax-bill.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">capital loss that can be deducted</a> each tax year. However, if the capital loss exceeds the limit, the difference may be <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital-loss-carryover.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">carried over</a> to the following tax year (or years).

A broker or barter exchange should report each transaction (other than regulated <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futures.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">futures</a>, foreign currency, or <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/section-1256-contract.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Section 1256</a> option contracts) on a separate Form 1099-B. 

A separate Form 1099-B must be filed for whoever has sold (including <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortsale.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">short sales</a>) stocks, commodities, regulated futures contracts, foreign currency contracts (pursuant to a forward contract or regulated futures contract), forward contracts, debt instruments, options, or securities futures contracts.

A company that participates in certain bartering activities with another company may need to file a Form 1099-B. It is used to report changes in <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalstructure.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">capital structure</a> or control of a corporation in which you hold stock. 

The form will report the cash received and the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fairmarketvalue.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">fair market value</a> of goods or services received or any <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trade-credit.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">trade credits</a> received. Taxpayers may be required to report the receipt of gains made during the bartering activity. Reportable gains can be in the form of cash, property, or stock.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5">﻿</span>﻿

All copies of Form 1099-B are available on the IRS website.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6">﻿</span>﻿

If you receive a 1099-B, you will need to file a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/scheduled.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Schedule D</a>. This is where you record your gains and losses for the year.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2">﻿</span>﻿ Form 8949 is used to record the details of the transactions.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿
