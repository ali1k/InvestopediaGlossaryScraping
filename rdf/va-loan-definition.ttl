A VA loan is a mortgage loan available through a program established by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (previously the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/veterans-administration.asp">Veterans Administration</a>). The VA sets the qualifying standards, dictates the terms of the mortgages offered and guarantees a portion of the loan, but doesn't actually offer the financing. VA home loans are provided by private lenders, such as banks and mortgage companies, instead.

VA loans assist active service members, veterans, and surviving spouses to become homeowners. IThe individual presents a certificate of eligibility from the VA to the lender in the course of a loan application. Although some of the lender's own underwriting requirements must still be met, in most cases, VA loans are easier to qualify for than conventional loans.

The Veterans Administration offers a home loan guaranty benefit and other housing-related programs to help qualified veterans or their eligible family members buy, build, repair, retain or adapt a home for personal occupancy. VA loans offer up to 100% financing on the value of a home. VA loan recipients do not have to be first-time home buyers. Also, they may reuse the benefits and assign the loan to another qualifying person. 

The terms of VA loans are quite generous, compared to other mortgages and even other federal loan programs. Among the benefits:

VA loans, FHA loans, and other loans insured by departments of the United States government have <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/securitization.asp">securitization </a>through the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/ginniemae.asp">Government National Mortgage Association</a> (GNMA),<br/>which is also known as Ginnie Mae. These securities carry the guarantee of the United States government.<br/>against default

The VA offers several types of mortgage loans to help veterans and their families.
