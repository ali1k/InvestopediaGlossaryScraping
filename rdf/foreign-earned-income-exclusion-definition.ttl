The foreign earned income exclusion is intended to prevent double taxation by excluding income taxed in another country from U.S. taxation. The U.S. Internal Revenue System (IRS) will tax your income earned worldwide. However, if you are an American ex-pat, this means you are taxed twice on this income. The income you receive overseas, sees the foreign country tax and can be taxed again by the IRS.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿

The foreign earned income exclusion is elected on IRS tax Form 2555.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2">﻿</span>﻿ Furthermore, taxpayers who claim this exclusion make domestic retirement plan contributions of any kind that are based on this income or claim the foreign tax credit or deduction for any taxes paid to a foreign government on this income.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿

You must meet specific qualifications to claim the foreign earned income exclusion.

There is a statutory maximum exclusion amount plus a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreign-housing-exclusion-deduction.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">foreign housing amount</a> which limits the exclusion. It is prorated if the number of qualifying days in a foreign country is less than a full tax year.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6">﻿</span>﻿

The foreign housing amount is the housing costs you paid with foreign earned income that exceeds 16% of the maximum exclusion, or base, amount. This amount has a cap amount at 30% of the maximum exclusion amount. The foreign housing amount is taken as exclusion by employees and as a deduction by the self-employed individuals.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6">﻿</span>﻿ <span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12">﻿</span>﻿ For the 2020 tax year, the maximum exclusion amount is $107,600, the base amount is $16,944, and the cap amount is $31,770. For the 2021 tax year, the maximum exclusion amount is $108,700.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14">﻿</span>﻿

Let’s see how the foreign earned income exclusion works. MP is an American working in Vietnam. They lived in Hanoi for 345 days of the tax year and were absent for 10 days on a trip home for Thanksgiving. They earned a salary of $225,000 and paid $30,596 of it to lease a flat for the year. MP paid $75,000 in Vietnamese income tax and owed $81,000 in US income tax on this income. The upshot is that their foreign earned income is being taxed twice.

Since MP is a U.S. citizen who paid foreign taxes on income they earned during 335 qualifying days in a foreign country, they may elect to exclude the foreign earned income from their U.S. <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxableincome.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">taxable income</a>.

MP’s 2018 exclusion is $111,000. ($105,900 maximum exclusion amount + $15,040 foreign housing amount x 335/365 ratio of qualifying days to total days).

MP's 2018 foreign housing amount is $15,040. ($30,596 in housing costs – $16,944 base amount). Since $13,652 is less than the $31,770 cap amount, no further reduction is necessary.

The foreign earned income exclusion allows MP to exclude $111,000 from their taxable income. But $114,000 remains included, and since they have paid foreign taxes of $37,000 and still owe U.S. taxes of $36,000, it remains double taxed. 

MP should take a $37,000 <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nonrefundabletaxcredit.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">nonrefundable</a> foreign tax credit against the $36,000 U.S. taxes they owe. As long as they timely file Form 2555 to elect the foreign earned income exclusion and Form 1116 claiming the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreign-tax-credit.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">foreign tax credit</a>, they will not owe U.S. taxes on the foreign income.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13">﻿</span>﻿
