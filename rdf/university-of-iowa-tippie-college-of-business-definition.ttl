The University of Iowa Tippie College of Business is the business school at the University of Iowa in Iowa City, Iowa. Founded in 1921, it offers both undergraduate and graduate programs.

Prior to 2019, the University of Iowa Tippie College of Business was well-known for its <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mba.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Master of Business Administration (MBA)</a>, which had been rated as the best finance-focused MBA program in the world by the Financial Times in 2016. In 2019, the school graduated its final cohort of full-time MBA students, although it continues to offer a Professional MBA program for those wishing to pursue their MBA on a part-time basis.

Previously known as the University of Iowa College of Commerce, the school became known as the University of Iowa Tippie College of Business in 1999, following a naming gift by the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/entrepreneur.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">entrepreneur</a> and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/philanthropy-4689685" rel="noopener noreferrer">philanthropist</a>, Henry B.

Today, the University of Iowa Tippie College of Business is home to over 4,000 students, including 3,000 undergraduate students and 1,500 students in graduate-level programs. The college's 450 faculty members maintain dedicated research centers in subjects such as <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financialaccounting.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">accounting</a>, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economics.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">economics</a>, and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/finance.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">finance</a>.

Graduate students who don't want to pursue an MBA can choose to do a Master of Accountancy (MAc) degree, a Master's and Certificate in Business Analytics, or a Master of Finance.
