The term no documentation (no doc) <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortgage.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">mortgage</a> refers to a loan that doesn't require <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/081816/how-do-mortgage-lenders-verify-employment.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">income verification</a> from the borrower. This type of loan is instead approved on a declaration that confirms the borrower can afford the loan payments. No doc mortgages are commonly given to those whose incomes aren't easily verified. Largely unregulated, these loans are mainly based on the resale potential of the secured property and the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/repayment.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">repayment</a> structure of the mortgage.

In order to qualify for a mortgage, borrowers are normally required to submit proof of <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/income.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">income</a>. This includes providing lenders with <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/w2form.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">W2s</a>, pay stubs, employment letters, bank statements, and/or recent <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxreturn.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">tax returns</a>. Lenders want to see that borrowers are able to afford payments on the loan by proving they have a stable and reliable source(s) of income. This is, of course, in addition to other factors such as a down payment and a suitable <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="4" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit_score.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">credit score</a>.

Some mortgages, however, don't require any proof of income. These are called no documentation (no doc) mortgages, no documentation loans, or no income verification mortgages, With these <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/loan.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">loans</a>, borrowers aren't required to provide any proof of income. Instead, they must simply provide a declaration that indicates they are able to repay the loan. These mortgages are commonly granted to people who don't have a regular income source, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/self-employed.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">self-employed</a> individuals, new immigrants, or temporary workers.

No documentation (no doc) mortgages do not meet the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumer-credit-protection-act-of-1968.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Consumer Credit Protection Act</a> requirement to reasonably verify the borrower’s financials. Because they don't require income verification, these mortgages tend to be very risky. Dodd-Frank regulations now require greater documentation on all types of loans and specifically mortgage loans. Now, bank statements and asset documentation are requirements.

No doc loans fall into the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/alt-a.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alt-A</a> category of lending products. These, along with other Alt-A loans—loans that fall between prime and subprime mortgages—have been known for high levels of default, These mortgages were among the culprits of the financial collapse in 2008, which led to the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/great-recession.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Great Recession</a>. However, mortgage loans are still available, which do not require tax returns for documentation of income. Other types of Alt-A loans include:

No doc and other Alt-A loans help house <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/flipper.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">flippers</a> and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/landlord.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">landlords</a> with multiple, expense write-offs on their tax returns to buy investment properties without thoroughly documenting their income. But lenders granting these loans require borrowers to have excellent credit scores and high cash reserves available to make large <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/down_payment.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">down payments</a>. The verification of a borrowers’ employment merely states monthly <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="4" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/grossincome.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">gross income</a> on the application. 

Down payment requirements are also different when it comes to these mortgages. At least a 30% down payment is required, while other mortgages may be as much as 35% to 50%. In comparison, most <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/conventionalmortgage.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">conventional mortgages</a> require a 20% down payment. Such mortgages also have a maximum 70 <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/loantovalue.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">loan-to-value ratio</a> (LTV). This ratio is calculated as the amount of the mortgage <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lien.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">lien</a> divided by the appraised value of the property, expressed as a percentage. 

The higher the borrower’s down payment on the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investment-property.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">investment property</a>, the easier it is to be approved for the loan. This business model holds true for many mortgages because lenders see that the borrower is willing to offer a significant amount of <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">capital</a>. This large lump sum payment may mean there is less likelihood that the borrower will default because of their considerable investment. 

The interest rates for no documentation and other Alt-A products are usually higher than rates for a traditional mortgage loan. Many of these limited documentation loans take their security basis from the equity position in a property.
