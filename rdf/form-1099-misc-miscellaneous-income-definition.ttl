Form 1099-MISC: Miscellaneous Income is an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) form taxpayers use to report non-employee compensation. This is generally a business payment—not a personal payment.

Independent contractors, freelancers, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/soleproprietorship.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">sole-proprietors</a>, and self-employed individuals, for example, receive one from each client who paid them $600 or more in a calendar year. The form is also used to report miscellaneous compensation such as rents, prizes, awards, healthcare payments, and payments to an attorney.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿

A 1099-MISC form is one of many in the 1099 series and among the most commonly used. Taxpayers receive 1099s, including Form 1099-MISC, shortly after the end of the tax year.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2">﻿</span>﻿ 

Form 1099-MISC: Miscellaneous Income is completed and sent out by someone who has paid at least $10 in royalties or broker payments instead of dividends or tax-exempt interest to another individual. The form is also sent to anyone who received at least $600 in:

This form can also be used to report earnings from direct sales of at least $5,000 of consumer products to a buyer for resale anywhere other than a permanent retail establishment.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿

The payer must send the form to the recipient and IRS by Feb. 1. The recipient can attach the form to their tax return.

Copy A of Form 1099-MISC appears on the IRS website in red. This copy of the form is not intended for print, rather it is for IRS use only.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4">﻿</span>﻿

The black parts of the form can be completed and printed:

The payer includes their name, address, and identification number, as well as the recipient's name, address, and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/ssn.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Social Security Number</a>.

A 1099-MISC form also has a series of boxes in which the payer will input whichever type of payment was made. That may include Rents in Box 1, Royalties in Box 2, or Non-Employee Compensation in Box 7. Other boxes that may be filled out include Box 4: Federal Income Tax Withheld and Box 16: State Tax Withheld.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6">﻿</span>﻿

All copies of Form 1099-MISC are available on the IRS website.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8">﻿</span>﻿

The IRS overhauled Form 1099-MISC in 2020 and introduced a new form, called <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1099nec.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">1099-NEC: Non-Employee Compensation</a>, starting in the 2020 tax year.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4">﻿</span>﻿ Form 1099-NEC will be used to report payments to non-employees currently reported in Box 7 of Form 1099-MISC. If you still need to report for tax year 2019, make sure to use the older <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-prior/f1099msc--2019.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">2019 version</a> of Form 1099-MISC.
