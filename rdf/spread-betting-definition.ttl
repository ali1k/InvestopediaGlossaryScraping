Spread betting refers to speculating on the direction of a financial market without actually owning the underlying security. It involves placing a bet on the price movement of a security. A spread betting company quotes two prices, the bid and ask price (also called the spread), and investors bet whether the price of the underlying security will be lower than the bid or higher than the ask. The investor does not own the underlying security in spread betting, they simply speculate on its price movement.

Spread betting allows investors to speculate on the price movement of a wide variety of financial instruments, such as <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">stocks</a>, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/forex/f/foreign-exchange-markets.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">forex</a>, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commodity.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">commodities</a> and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="4" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixed-incomesecurity.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">fixed income securities</a>. In other words, an investor makes a bet based on whether they think the market will rise or fall from the time their bet is accepted. They also get to choose how much they want to risk on their bet. It is promoted as a tax free,<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿ commission free activity that allows investors to speculate in both <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="5" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bullmarket.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">bull</a> and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="6" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearmarket.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">bear</a> markets.

Spread betting is a leveraged product which means investors only need to deposit a small percentage of the position's value. For example, if the value of a position is $50,000 and the margin requirement is 10%, a deposit of just $5,000 is required. This magnifies both gains and losses which means investors can lose more than their initial investment.

Let’s assume that the price of ABC stock is $201.50 and a spread-betting company, with a fixed spread, is quoting the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bid-and-ask.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">bid/ask</a> at $200 / $203 for investors to transact on it. The investor is bearish and believes that ABC is going to fall below $200 so they <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hitthebid.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">hit the bid</a> to sell at $200. They decide to bet $20 for every point the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">stock</a> falls below their transacted price of $200. If ABC falls to where the bid/ask is $185/$188, the investor can close their trade with a profit of {($200 - $188) * $20 = $240}. If the price rises to $212/$215, and they choose to close their trade, then they will lose {($200 - $215) * $20 = -$300}.

The spread betting firm requires a 20% margin, which means the investor needs to deposit 20% of the value of the position at its inception, {($200 * $20) * 20% = $800, into their account to cover the bet. The position value is derived by multiplying the bet size by the stock’s bid price ($20 x $200 = $4,000).
