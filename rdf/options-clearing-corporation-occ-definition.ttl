    invp:description """
The Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) is an organization that acts as both the issuer and guarantor for <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/difference-between-options-and-futures/" rel="noopener noreferrer">options and futures contracts</a>. The largest equity derivatives clearing organization in the world, it operates under the jurisdiction of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC).

The OCC should not be confused with the U.S. Treasury's Office of the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/office-comptroller-currency-occ.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Comptroller of the Currency,</a> which also goes by the acronym 'OCC'.

The objective of the OCC, which was founded in 1973, is to instill stability in the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equity_derivative.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">equity derivatives</a> market. According to its mission statement, the OCC is a customer-driven <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/clearingcorporation.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">clearing organization</a> that delivers risk management, clearance, and settlement services.

Under its SEC jurisdiction, the OCC <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/clearing.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">clears</a> transactions for put and call options, stock indexes, foreign currencies, interest rate composites, and single-stock futures. Meanwhile, as a registered derivatives clearing organization (DCO) under CFTC jurisdiction, it provides clearing and settlement services for transactions in futures products, as well as <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/options-on-futures.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">options on futures</a>.

The organization essentially acts as a guarantor to ensure the obligations of the contracts it clears are fulfilled. A <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/boardofdirectors.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">board of directors</a> (B of D) populated by representatives from exchanges, clearing members and management oversee the OCC, and most of its revenue comes from <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/clearingfee.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">clearing fees</a> charged to its members.

The OCC also provides research services and other value-added solutions that support and grow the markets that it serves. The corporation serves 16 different <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exchange.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">exchanges</a>, including the C2 Options Exchange, Chicago Board Options Exchange, International Securities Exchange, Nasdaq OMX BX, Nasdaq OMX PHLX, NYSE American Options, and NYSE Arca Options.

The aftermath of the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-crisis.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">2008 financial crisis</a> brought new scrutiny and purpose to the OCC. Changes were made so it could adapt its operations to better address risk. Federal regulators began to see the OCC as an increasingly integral part of the governance and oversight of the markets. The heightened attention focused on the organization brought with it some unfavorable assessments by regulators.

In 2013, the SEC criticized the OCC’s management and planning for the way it handled market-wide issues. The SEC also said the OCC’s management at that time lacked appropriate supervision in terms of <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corporategovernance.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">corporate governance</a>. The SEC further cited numerous <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/conflict-of-interest.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">conflicts of interest</a> with the management and board of directors, which called into question the organization’s commitment to regulatory compliance.

This led to the introduction of new executive leadership, including the addition of new positions to reinforce the OCC's compliance efforts.

The OCC's management and leadership currently consist of a diverse team of people from different parts of the investment world, including exchanges, clearing members, and other directors.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿ As of December 2020, key figures include:
