Green chip <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">stocks</a> are <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shares.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">shares</a> of environmentally-friendly companies. Green chip stocks are likely to be concentrated in areas such as alternative energy, pollution control, carbon abatement, and recycling.

But despite these issues, green chip stocks may attract significant interest from investors who care about environmentally-friendly market leaders. These stocks are popular with investors who want to focus on <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sri.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">socially responsible investing</a> (SRI).

The term green chip stocks, or green chips, is derived from <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bluechip.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">blue chips</a>, which refers to stocks that are considered to be <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/industry.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">industry</a> leaders and consistently profitable. Green chips, though, represent public companies whose primary focus and business are seen as eco-friendly or beneficial to the environment. As such, a typical green chip may not always be as profitable as a blue chip. That's because its <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-structure.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">financial structure</a> may be less stable than that of a blue chip.

Individuals who focus on socially responsible investing generally tend to favor green chips over other companies, regardless of how well they perform. In fact, these companies and their stocks are increasingly popular as environmental issues and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corp-social-responsibility.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">corporate social responsibility</a> (CSR) take on more importance in the business world. This <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investing_style.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">investment style</a> focuses on companies that have a positive impact on society including those that promote high moral values and have a positive impact on the environment.

Any <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/publiccompany.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">public company</a> that operates in the green industry is considered a green chip. These companies may take part in the following:

These segments can be further divided into more specific categories. For instance, the renewable energy segment can be divided into several categories including wind power, solar energy, and geothermal power.

Wind power is, in fact, one of the fastest-growing sources of alternative energy and has continued to grow within the last 20 years due to a drop in costs.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿ Solar power consists of solar power companies and those associated with the construction and installation of these systems. One of the newest entrants into the green sector is the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/insights/110916/economic-benefits-legalizing-weed.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">legal cannabis</a> industry.

These shares tend to be more <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volatility.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">volatile</a> than other, more profitable companies. Most investors are willing to overlook their limitations during <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bullmarket.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">bull markets</a>, which is when they tend to surge.

But some investors may not be willing to follow suit during <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearmarket.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">bear markets</a> and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/recession.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">recessions</a>. That's because there tends to be a flight to safety during these periods, as investors flock to companies that are able to provide more sustainable and predictable returns.

For instance, alternative energy stocks were among the best performers in the latter part of the global bull market between 2003 and 2007, as the search for other energy sources assumed greater importance in an economic situation of triple-digit prices in <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/crude-oil.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">crude oil</a>. But these stocks experienced a sudden reversal of fortune in the 2008 bear market, as investors exited their positions in droves due to uncertainty about the global recession and the collapse in conventional energy prices.

The outlook for green chips is also generally affected by the level of government <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/subsidy.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">subsidies</a> and support available to them or to users of their end products. While higher subsidy levels can boost these stocks, reduced government subsidies can have an adverse impact on them.
