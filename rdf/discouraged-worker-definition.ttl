A discouraged worker is a person who is eligible for employment and can work but is currently unemployed and has not attempted to find employment in the last four weeks. Discouraged workers have usually given up on searching for a job because they found no suitable employment options or failed to secure a job when they applied.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5">﻿</span>﻿

The U.S. Department of Labor’s <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bls.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)</a> defines discouraged workers as “those persons not in the labor force who want and are available for work, and who have looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months, but were not counted as unemployed because they had not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey." The BLS adds that "discouraged workers were not currently looking for work specifically because they believed no jobs were available for them or there were none for which they would qualify.”<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"></span>

As discouraged workers are no longer looking for employment, they are not counted as active in the labor force. This means that the headline <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unemploymentrate.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">unemployment rate</a>, which is based solely on the active labor force number, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/10/unemployment-rate-get-real.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">does not take into account the number of discouraged workers</a> in the country.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"></span>

The causes for worker discouragement are complex and varied. In some cases, workers fall out of the workforce because they are not equipped to deal with technological change in their workplace. An example of this occurred during the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/great-recession.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Great Recession</a>, when the manufacturing sector shed senior staff unable to work on the new computer numeric control (CNC) machines, used for cutting wood and other hard materials, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/us-manufacturing-sees-shortage-of-skilled-factory-workers/2012/02/17/gIQAo0MLOR_story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to a report by <em>The Washington Post</em></a>.

Nick Eberstadt of the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) has blamed the “flight from work” on a lack of supply of skilled, able, and willing workers and an increasing reliance on <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/disability-insurance.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">disability insurance</a>.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"></span> His theory is backed by Alan Krueger’s 2016 research, which found that self-reported pain and disability insurance was higher among discouraged workers.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"></span>

Other possible reasons for discouraged workers include restrictions that limit employment options for formerly incarcerated individuals and jobs that are perceived as being inaccessible to a specific gender.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"></span><span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"></span>

To better analyze unemployment in the U.S., the BLS created <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/080415/true-unemployment-rate-u6-vs-u3.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">alternative measures for the underutilization of labor</a>. U-4, U-5, and U-6 capture discouraged workers.

At the close of 2019, the U-4 rate, seasonally adjusted, was 3.7%, just a shade higher than the headline, or official, unemployment rate of 3.5%.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"></span><span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"></span> Fast forward a year to December 2020, and the U-4 rate, seasonally adjusted, was 7.1%, as compared with the official rate of 6.7%.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"></span><span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"></span>

Figures from 2020 were significantly impacted by the economic damage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Still, the current U-4 number is not as bad as the 2009 annual average, which stood at 9.7% in the throes of the Great Recession.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"></span>

The U-4 rate helps to quantify how many discouraged workers exist and keep tabs on the change in their numbers. Further analysis of age groups, race, and geographic location is also made possible by U-4 measures.

Policymakers at the federal, state and local level can use these numbers to formulate plans to assist them. Such plans may consist of training programs, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/subsidy.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">subsidies</a> for education, or <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxcredit.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">tax credits</a> for companies that hire long-term unemployed individuals.
