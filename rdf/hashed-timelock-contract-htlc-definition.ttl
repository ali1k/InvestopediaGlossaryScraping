A Hashed Timelock Contract (HTLC) is a type of <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smart-contracts.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">smart contract</a> used in blockchain applications to eliminate counterparty risk by enabling the implementation of time-bound transactions. In practical terms, this means that recipients of a transaction have to acknowledge payment by generating cryptographic proof within a certain timeframe. Otherwise, the transaction does not take place.

<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/atomic-swaps.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Atomic swaps</a>, cross-chain trading between cryptocurrencies is often achieved using HTLCs. In addition, Bitcoinâ€™s <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lightning-network.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">lightning network</a> (LN) also employs HTLCs.

A Hashed Timelock Contract (HTLC) uses several elements from existing <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cryptocurrency.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">cryptocurrency</a> transactions. For example, HTLC transactions use multiple signatures, which consist of a private-public key, to verify and validate transactions. But there are two elements that distinguish HTLC from standard cryptocurrency transactions or ordinary smart contracts.

The first element is the hashlock. A hashlock is a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hash.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">hashed</a>, or cryptographically scrambled version of a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/public-key.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">public key</a> generated by the originator of a transaction. The associated <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/private-key.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">private key</a> is then used to unlock the original hash. In HTLC, the originating party generates a key and hashes it. The hash is stored in a pre-image that is subsequently revealed during the final transaction. HTLCs are programmed to expire after a certain period of time or number of <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="4" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/block-bitcoin-block.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">blocks</a> generated, creating a known termination date.

The second important element of HTLC is a timelock. Two different timelocks are used to set time constraints on contracts generated using HTLC. The first one is CheckLockTimeVerify (CLTV). It uses a time base to lock and release bitcoins. This means that time constraints are hardcoded and coins are released only at a specific time and date or a specific height of block size.

The second one is CheckSequenceVerify (CSV). It is not dependent on time. Instead, it uses the number of blocks generated as a measure to keep track of when to finalize a transaction.

Suppose Alice wants to exchange her Bitcoin for Litecoin from Bob. A typical HTLC transaction between them takes place as follows:
