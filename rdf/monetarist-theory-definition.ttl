The monetarist theory is an economic concept that contends that changes in <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/moneysupply.asp">money supply</a> are the most significant determinants of the rate of <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economicgrowth.asp">economic growth</a> and the behavior of the business cycle. When monetarist theory works in practice, central banks, which control the levers of monetary policy, can exert much power over economic growth rates.

The competing theory to the monetarist theory is <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/keynesianeconomics.asp">Keynesian economics</a>.

According to monetarist theory, if a nation's supply of money increases, economic activity will increaseâ€”and vice versa.

Monetarist theory is governed by a simple formula: MV = PQ, where M is the money supply, V is the velocity (number of times per year the average dollar is spent), P is the price of goods and services and Q is the quantity of goods and services. Assuming constant V, when M is increased, either P, Q, or both P and Q rise.

General price levels tend to rise more than the production of goods and services when the economy is closer to <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fullemployment.asp">full employment</a>. When there is slack in the economy, Q will increase at a faster rate than P under monetarist theory.

In the U.S., the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalreservebank.asp">Federal Reserve</a> (Fed) sets monetary policy without government interference. The Fed operates on a monetarist theory that focuses on maintaining stable prices (low <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp">inflation</a>), promoting full employment, and achieving steady gross domestic product (GDP) growth.

In the U.S., it is the job of the Fed to control the money supply. The Fed has three main levers:

Former Federal Reserve Chairman <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/alangreenspan.asp">Alan Greenspan</a> was a proponent of monetarist theory. During his initial years at the Fed in 1988, he increased <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp">interest rates</a>, decreasing growth and raising inflation rates, which almost touched five percent.

The U.S. economy tipped into recession during the early 1990s. In response, Chairman Greenspan boosted economic prospects by commencing on a rate-cutting spree that resulted in the longest period of economic expansion in the history of the U.S. economy. A loose <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monetarypolicy.asp">monetary policy</a> of low interest rates made the U.S. economy prone to bubbles, culminating in the 2008 financial crisis and the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/great-recession.asp">Great Recession</a>.
