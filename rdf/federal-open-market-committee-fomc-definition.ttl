The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is the branch of the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalreservebank.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Federal Reserve System</a> (FRS) that determines the direction of <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monetarypolicy.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">monetary policy</a> specifically by directing open market operations (OMO). The committee is made up of twelve members: the seven members of the Board of Governors; the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; and four of the remaining eleven Reserve Bank presidents on a rotating basis.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿

When it is reported in the news that the Fed has changed interest rates, it is the result of the FOMC's regular meetings.

The 12 members of the FOMC meet eight times a year to discuss whether there should be any changes to near-term monetary policy.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿ A vote to change policy would result in either buying or selling <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/governmentsecurity.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">U.S. government securities</a> on the open market to promote the growth of the national economy.

The FOMC consists of the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/board-of-governors.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Board of Governors</a>, which has seven members, and five Federal Reserve Bank presidents.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿ Members of the committee are typically categorized as hawks favoring tighter monetary policies, doves who favor <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economic-stimulus.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">stimulus</a>, or centrists/moderates, somewhere in between.

By tradition, the chairman of the FOMC is also the Chair of the Board of Governors.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2">﻿</span>﻿ The current Chair of the Federal Reserve Board is Jerome Powell, who was sworn in on February 5, 2018.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿ Powell is considered a moderate. Other members include Richard Clarida, Randall Quarles, Lael Brainard, and Michelle Bowman. The remaining two positions are vacant as of Dec. 12, 2020.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4">﻿</span>﻿

The vice chairman of the FOMC is also the president of the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federal-reserve-bank-of-new-york.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Federal Reserve Bank of New York</a>,<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2">﻿</span>﻿ a position currently filled by John C. Williams, who took office on June 18, 2018, as the 11th president and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/ceo.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">chief executive officer</a> of the 2nd District Federal Reserve Bank of New York.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5">﻿</span>﻿ The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York serves continuously, while the presidents of the other Reserve Banks serve one-year terms on a three-year rotating schedule (except for Cleveland and Chicago, which rotate on a two-year basis).<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10">﻿</span>﻿

The one-year rotating seats of the FOMC are always comprised of one Reserve Bank president from each of the following groups:

The geographic-group system helps ensure that all regions of the United States receive fair representation.

<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has eight regularly scheduled meetings each year, but they can meet more often if the need should arise.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿ The meetings are not held in public, and therefore, are the subject of much speculation on Wall Street, as analysts attempt to predict whether the Fed will tighten or loosen the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/moneysupply.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">money supply</a> with a resulting rise or fall in interest rates. In recent years, FOMC meeting minutes have been made public following the meetings.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6">﻿</span>﻿

During the meeting, members discuss developments in the local and global financial markets, as well as economic and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economic-forecasting.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">financial forecasts</a>. All participants—Board of Governors and all twelve Reserve Bank presidents—share their views on the country’s economic stance and converse on the monetary policy that would be most beneficial for the country. After much deliberation by all participants, only designated FOMC members get to vote on a policy that they consider appropriate for the period.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2">﻿</span>﻿

Through <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/openmarketoperations.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">open market operations</a> (OMO), adjusting the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/discountrate.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">discount rate</a> and setting <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/requiredreserves.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">bank reserve requirements</a>, the Federal Reserve possesses the tools necessary to increase or decrease the money supply. The Fed's Board of Governors is in charge of setting the discount rate and reserve requirements, while the FOMC is specifically in charge of open market operations, which entails buying and selling government securities.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿ For example, to tighten the money supply and decrease the amount of money available in the banking system, the Fed would offer government securities for sale.

Securities bought by the FOMC are deposited in the Fed's <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/soma.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">System Open Market Account</a> (SOMA), which consists of a domestic and a foreign portfolio. The domestic portfolio holds <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/073113/introduction-treasury-securities.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">U.S. Treasuries</a> and Federal Agency securities, while the foreign portfolio holds investments denominated in <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/euro.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">euros</a> and Japanese <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="4" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/forex/j/jpy-japanese-yen.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">yen</a>.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7">﻿</span>﻿

The FOMC can hold these securities until maturity or sell them when they see fit, as granted by the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/1913-federal-reserve-act.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Federal Reserve Act of 1913</a> and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monetary-control-act.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monetary Control Act of 1980</a>. A percentage of the Fed's SOMA holdings are held in each of the 12 regional Reserve Banks. However, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York executes all of the Fed's open market transactions.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7">﻿</span>﻿

Simply put, the process begins with the results of the meeting being communicated to the SOMA manager who relays them to the trading desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York which then conducts transactions of government securities on the open market until the FOMC mandate is met.

The interaction of all the Fed's policy tools determines the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalfundsrate.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">federal funds rate</a> or the rate at which depository institutions lend their balances at the Federal Reserve to each other on an overnight basis. The federal funds rate, in turn, directly influences other short-term rates and indirectly influences long-term interest rates;<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11">﻿</span>﻿ <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exchangerate.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">foreign exchange rates</a>, and the supply of credit and demand for investment, employment, and economic output.

On January 29, 2019, at its annual organizational meeting, the FOMC unanimously reaffirmed its "Statement of Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy" with an updated reference to the median of participants' estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment in the "Summary of Economic Projections" (December 2018).<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9">﻿</span>﻿

This statement is based on the<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20190130b.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer"> FOMC's commitment to fulfilling a statutory mandate</a> from Congress of promoting maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. Since monetary policy determines the inflation rate over the long term, the FOMC can specify a longer-run goal for inflation. In the statement, the FOMC reaffirmed its analysis that a 2% target inflation rate was the rate most consistent with its statutory mandate.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8">﻿</span>﻿
