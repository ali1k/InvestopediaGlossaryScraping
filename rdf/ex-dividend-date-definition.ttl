The ex-dividend date, or ex-date for short, is one of four stages that companies go through when they pay <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">dividends</a> to their shareholders. The ex-dividend date is important because it determines whether the buyer of a stock will be entitled to receive its upcoming dividend.

To understand the ex-dividend date, we need to understand the four stages companies go through when they pay dividends to their shareholders:

To illustrate this process, consider a company that declares an upcoming dividend on Tuesday, July 30th. If the record date is Thursday, August 8th, then the ex-dividend date would be Tuesday, August 6th. In this scenario, only shareholders who bought their shares on Monday, August 5th (or earlier), would be entitled to receive a dividend. The payable date can vary depending on the preferences of the company; but of course, it will always be the last of the four dates.

Many investors want to buy their shares before the ex-dividend date in order to ensure that they are eligible to receive the upcoming dividend. However, if you find yourself buying shares and realizing that you missed the ex-dividend date, you may not have missed out as much as you thought.

The reason for this is that share prices usually drop by the amount of the dividend on the ex-dividend date. This makes sense because the company’s assets will soon be declining by the amount of the dividend.

For example, if a company announces a dividend equivalent to 2% of its stock price, its stock will typically decline by 2% on the ex-dividend date. Therefore, if you bought the shares on or shortly after the ex-dividend date, you probably obtained a “discount” of about 2% relative to the price you would have paid shortly before. In this way, you may not be any worse off than the investors who received the dividend.
