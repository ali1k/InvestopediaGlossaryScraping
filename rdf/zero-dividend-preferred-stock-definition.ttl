A zero-dividend <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/preferredstock.asp">preferred stock</a> is a preferred share issued by a company that is not required to pay a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp">dividend</a> to its holder. The owner of a zero-dividend preferred share will earn income from <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalappreciation.asp">capital appreciation</a> and may receive a one-time payment at the end of the investment term.

When a company issues stock, they issue two types: preferred stock and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commonstock.asp">common stock</a>. Preferred stock has priority over common stock when it comes to dividends and asset distribution and is therefore seen as less risky. Preferred stock usually does not have <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/votingright.asp">voting rights</a>, whereas common stock does.

Owners of zero-dividend <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/preference-shares.asp">preference shares</a> will not receive a normal dividend but they will still maintain reimbursement priority over <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/common_shareholder.asp">common shareholders</a> in the event of a bankruptcy. In such an event, they will get a fixed sum that was agreed upon in advance.

Zero-dividend preferred stock is comparable in some ways to <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/z/zero-couponbond.asp">zero-coupon bonds</a>, though they are regarded as lower tier than bonds. Still, they do have upper-tier preference compared with common shareholders if a bankruptcy occurs. This type of stock is usually backed by the issuer’s assets and can be part of split capital investment trusts as a sort of share to produce fixed capital growth in a defined period.

Companies that are likely to issue zero-dividend preferred stock include investment trusts, particularly those that may face challenges getting long-term debt approved. Zero-dividend preferred stock usually comes with a specific time period.

Issuing zero-dividend preferred stock is a way for an investment trust to raise <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital.asp">capital</a> that is easier than seeking a loan from a bank, and oftentimes lasts much longer than a bank would typically be willing to lend for. Zero-dividend preferred stock also comes with fewer restrictions than a bank would include in a loan. A zero-dividend preferred stock raises capital, holds no voting rights, and doesn't pay out a dividend. It's an extremely attractive option for a company to issue.

There are many advantages and disadvantages for an investor that come with a zero-dividend preferred stock.
