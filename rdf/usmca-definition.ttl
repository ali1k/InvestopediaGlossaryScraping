The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, also known as the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" href="https://ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements/united-states-mexico-canada-agreement/agreement-between" rel="noopener noreferrer">USMCA</a>, is a trade deal between the three nations which was signed on November 30, 2018.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿ The USMCA replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement (<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nafta.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">NAFTA</a>), which had been in effect since January of 1994. Under the terms of NAFTA, tariffs on many goods passing between North America's three major economic powers were gradually phased out. By 2008, tariffs on various agricultural and textiles products, automobiles, and other goods were reduced or eliminated.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2">﻿</span>﻿

The USMCA was negotiated under the Trump Administration, but the idea of a replacement for NAFTA dates back before President Trump's presidential term. Over the years, NAFTA had frequently been <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" href="https://www.thebalance.com/disadvantages-of-nafta-3306273" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">blamed for the export of U.S. manufacturing to Mexico</a> and the accompanying loss of jobs and suppression of wages among U.S. workers. In 2008, then-presidential candidate Obama had pledged to renegotiate NAFTA in the interests of American workers but later declined to do so during his administration.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="20">﻿</span>﻿﻿

As a candidate in the 2016 election, President Trump campaigned on renegotiating NAFTA in order to try and get more favorable terms for the U.S. The USMCA began to officially take shape when the Trump administration sent the required 90-day notice to Congress that he was going to begin talks to renegotiate NAFTA. The talks officially began on August 16, 2017 and ended on September 30, 2018.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9">﻿</span>﻿﻿

First, the Mexican Senate ratified the deal on June 19, 2019, and approved amendments to it on December 12, 2019.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8">﻿</span>﻿﻿ <span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7">﻿</span>﻿﻿ Then, on December 19, 2019, the U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation to approve the USMCA. The legislation passed the Senate in January 16, 2020, and on January 29, President Trump signed it into law.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9">﻿</span>﻿﻿ Finally, the Canadian Parliament ratified the treaty on March 13, 2020.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10">﻿</span>﻿﻿

Several difficulties emerged before and shortly after the treaty went into effect on July 1, 2020. First, on May 31, 2019, President Trump said starting June 10, the U.S. will impose a 5% tariff on all Mexican imports. He threatened this increase in tariffs unless the Mexican government took sterner measures to lower the number of Central American asylum seekers entering the U.S. from Mexico. A deal was reached to avoid the tariffs on June 8, 2020.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12">﻿</span>﻿﻿ <span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11">﻿</span>﻿﻿ On August 6, 2020, President Trump announced he would reinstate tariffs on Canadian aluminum, which had originally been put in place in 2018.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="18">﻿</span>﻿﻿ The Canadian government responded, saying it was planning to place equal tariffs on U.S. aluminum products. On October 27, the same day the Canadian government was expected to unveil its retaliatory trade measures, President Trump suspended the tariffs, retroactive through September 1. However, the office of the U.S. Trade Representative said that the U.S. may reinstate the tariffs if aluminum imports from Canada "exceed 105 percent of the expected volume in any month".<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="19">﻿</span>﻿﻿

Per the Office of the United States Trade Representative, the USMCA is a "mutually beneficial win for North American workers, farmers, ranchers, and businesses." NAFTA aimed to create a free trade zone between the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, and the USMCA utilizes NAFTA as a basis for a new agreement. While the USMCA has a broad impact on trade of all kinds between the three named nations, some of the agreement's most important provisions include the following:<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14">﻿</span>﻿﻿
