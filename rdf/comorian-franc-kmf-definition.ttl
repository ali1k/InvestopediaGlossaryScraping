The term Comorian franc (KMF) refers to the official national <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currency.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">currency</a> of Comoros, a sovereign African island nation located in the Indian Ocean. It is maintained and issued by the country's <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/centralbank.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">central bank</a>, la Banque Centrale des Comores.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9">﻿</span>﻿ It is represented by the symbol KMF on global currency exchanges.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10">﻿</span>﻿ The Comorian franc was <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currency-peg.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">pegged</a> to the euro as of 1999 at a rate of 491.96775 Comorian francs to one euro.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11">﻿</span>﻿ As of March 2021, $1 U.S. is equal to roughly 409 KMF.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿

The franc is the official national currency of the island archipelago of Comoros. The country's central bank is responsible for maintaining its value and is in charge of its <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currency-in-circulation.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">circulation</a>. The bank, called la Banque Centrale des Comores, was established in 1981, six years after the country gained its independence.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13">﻿</span>﻿ The central bank is located in the capital of Moroni.

Banknotes are printed in various <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/denomination.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">denominations</a> ranging from the 500, 1000, 2000, 5000, and 10,000 franc notes.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12">﻿</span>﻿ The country also uses coins, which are minted in 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100 franc denominations.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11">﻿</span>﻿ A single franc is divided into 100 centimes, although no centimes have ever been issued or used.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12">﻿</span>﻿

The KMF is pegged to the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/euro.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">euro</a>. This relationship was established when the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/europeanunion.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">European Union</a> adopted the euro in 1999. The <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exchangerate.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">exchange rate</a> was fixed—and remains as such—at 491.96775 francs to one euro.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11">﻿</span>﻿ Prior to this, the Comorian franc was pegged to the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="4" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/franc-f.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">French franc</a> at a rate of 50 KMF to 1 French franc. Currency rankings show that the KMF is most often exchanged with the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="5" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/forex/u/usd-united-states-dollar.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">United States dollar</a> (USD).<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10">﻿</span>﻿

Cash is predominantly used in the island nation. Larger establishments, such as hotels, may take <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditcard.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">credit cards</a>.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15">﻿</span>﻿ <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/transaction.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Transactions</a> are executed in the local currency, although there are some merchants who accept both the U.S. dollar and the euro along with the Comoros franc. Change, however, is given in the KMF.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14">﻿</span>﻿

Comoros has one of the poorest and smallest <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economy.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">economies</a> in the world. The island’s workforce has a low level of education, and there are not enough natural resources available either for residents or to use as <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/export.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">exports</a>.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4">﻿</span>﻿

The primary industries of the nation, fishing and tourism, are vulnerable to the region’s extreme weather conditions and sporadic volcanic activity. As a result, despite a relatively low rate of <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unemployment.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">unemployment</a> in the range of 6% to 10%, roughly half of its 851,000 citizens live below the poverty line.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4">﻿</span>﻿ The population of Comoros is largely young—approximately 40% of residents are 14 years old or younger.

Agriculture is crucial to the local economy of Comoros, as is the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/income.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">income</a> generated by its three major exports, vanilla, cloves, and a perfume essence known as ylang-ylang. Despite the archipelago’s arable land, fertile soil, and large fishing <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/industry.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">industry</a>, the country still imports around 70 percent of its food. For 2019, Comoros saw real GDP growth of 1.9% with <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">inflation</a> at 2%.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8">﻿</span>﻿﻿<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7">﻿</span>﻿

Comoros was initially part of a French colony, which included Madagascar, when the island of Mayotte was purchased in 1841, but the first Europeans to discover the archipelago were Portuguese in the year 1505.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5">﻿</span>﻿ As a French colony, the money used was the French franc.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4">﻿</span>﻿

In 1920, Comorian currency was first printed on an emergency basis on a series of Madagascar postage stamps that had been altered to become <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/legal-tender.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">legal tender</a> and circulate as money in exchange. The Comorian franc was first formally issued in the 1960s and has appeared in both coin and bill form in various denominations.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6">﻿</span>﻿ Coins dedicated specifically to Comoros were issued in the early 1960s, and Arabic printing has been stamped on them since 1975.

The Union of Comoros is made of three islands: Anjouan, Moheli, and Grande Comore. A fourth island, Mayotte, was part of the archipelago union until 1975, when the Comoros Union declared its independence from France. However, France did not recognize the independence of Mayotte, and the island remains under French administration to this day.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7">﻿</span>﻿
