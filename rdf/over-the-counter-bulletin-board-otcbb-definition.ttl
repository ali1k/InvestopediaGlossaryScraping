The over-the-counter bulletin board (OTCBB) is an electronic <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quotation.asp">quotation</a> (quote) service provided by the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/finra.asp">Financial Industry Regulatory Authority</a> (FINRA) to its subscribing members that provided <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otc.asp">over-the-counter</a> (OTC) trade data for U.S. stocks. Unlike other OTC platforms, OTCBB is a quotation-only service.

In 2020, FINRA announced it would be winding down the OTCBB, as the bulk of OTC stock trading now occurs on <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/070513/otcbb-and-otc-markets-group.asp">OTC Markets Group's</a> platforms.

In the past, the OTCBB offered traders and investors up-to-the-minute quotes, last-sale prices, and volume information for equity securities traded over-the-counter. All companies listed on this platform had to file current financial statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or a regulator.

The over-the-counter bulletin board (OTCBB) was started in 1990 after the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/penny-stock-reform-act.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990</a> stipulated that the SEC must develop some type of electronic quotation system for stocks that could not be listed on one of the major exchanges.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿ Stocks that traded over the counter were traded between individuals and market makers using computers and telephones.

As is the case today, over-the-counter stocks on the OTCBB were not part of any major exchanges. This is primarily because OTC stocks tend to be small and volatile. This makes meeting <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/listingrequirements.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">listing requirements</a> difficult.

More importantly from the trading standpoint, the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bid-askspread.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">bid-ask spread</a> is typically larger for these stocks as they typically trade with less frequency than exchange-listed stocks.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4">﻿</span>﻿ Only a select few OTCBB stocks successfully moved from the OTC market to a major exchange.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿

For those small companies that cannot meet the listing requirements to trade their securities on national exchanges, the OTCBB was an important alternative and the current offerings of OTC Markets continue to play this role. Small companies need financing from investors to grow, even though their total market value might never rival a mid-cap stock. Investors, in turn, are attracted to the outsized returns that can still occur on the OTC market as some of these firms do find ongoing success and outsized profits.

While these companies use the OTC markets in place of one of the major exchanges, it is important for investors to remember that the OTCBB and OTC Markets are not, in fact, an actual exchange but merely a quotation service. All securities traded over-the-counter are, in reality, traded by a web of market makers who input different quotes and trades through a secure computer network that can only be accessed by those who subscribe.

As mentioned up top, pretty much all OTC stock quotes and trades are now conducted on OTC Markets Group's platforms including <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otcqx.asp">OTCQX</a>, OTCQB, and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otc-pink.asp">OTC Pink</a>.

<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" href="http://www.finra.org/industry/otcbb/otc-bulletin-board-otcbb">OTCBB still provides market information through FINRA's website</a>, but it is now all but obsolescent now.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"></span> The <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otcqb.asp">OTCQB</a>, in particular, effectively replaced the OTCBB as the main market for trading OTC securities that report to a U.S. regulator. As it has no minimum financial standards, the OTCQB often includes shell companies, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pennystock.asp">penny stocks</a>, and small foreign issuers.

FINRA filed a rule change in December of 2020 with the SEC that proposes and plans to cease the operations of the OTCBB altogether in the near future.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"></span>

The <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pinksheets.asp">pink sheets</a> are a privately held company, while FINRA provided the OTCBB service. The other difference between the pink sheets and OTCBB is that there are stricter <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/updates/how-to-invest-in-penny-stocks/">standards for OTCBB</a>. OTCBB issuers have to register with the SEC.  So named because they were actually printed on pink paper, the Pink Sheets started out as a daily quote service provided by the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/national-quote-bureau.asp">National Quotation Bureau</a> (NQS), which in 2011 changed its name to OTC Markets Group.
