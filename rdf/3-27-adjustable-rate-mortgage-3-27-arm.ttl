A 3/27 adjustable-rate mortgage, or 3/27 ARM, is a 30-year mortgage frequently offered to <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/subprime-borrower.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">subprime borrowers</a>, meaning people with lower credit scores or a history of loan delinquencies. The mortgages are designed as short-term financing vehicles that give borrowers time to repair their credit until they are able to refinance into a mortgage with more favorable terms.

3/27 adjustable-rate mortgages, or 3/27 ARMs, have a three-year fixed interest rate period, which is generally lower than the current rates on a 30-year conventional mortgage. But after three years and for the remaining 27 years of the loan, the rate floats based on an index, such as the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/libor.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor) </a>or the yield on <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurybill.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">one-year U.S. Treasury bills</a>. The bank also adds a margin on top of the index; the total is known as the spread or the fully indexed interest rate. This rate typically is substantially higher than the initial three-year fixed interest rate, although 3/27 mortgages usually have caps on the increase. Commonly, these loans top out at a rate increase of 2 percent per adjustment period, which could occur every six or 12 months. Note that means the <em>rate</em> can increase by two full points, not 2 percent of the current interest rate. There might also be a life-of-the-loan cap of 5 percent or more. To avoid payment shock when the interest rate begins to adjust, purchasers of 3/27 mortgages typically intend to refinance the mortgage within the first three years.

A serious risk for borrowers is that they cannot afford to refinance their loan in three years. This could be due to a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditrating.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">credit rating</a> that is still sub-standard, or a drop in the value of their home, or simply market forces that cause interest rates to rise across the board. Moreover, many 3/27 mortgages carry <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/prepaymentpenalty.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">prepayment penalties</a>, which make refinancing costly.

Many 3/27 mortgage borrowers fail to recognize how much their monthly payments increase after three years. For example, say a borrower takes out a $250,000 loan at an initial teaser rate of 3.5 percent. That’s a great mortgage rate at the start, but let’s assume that after three years, the floating interest rate is at 3 percent and the bank’s margin is 2.5 percent. That adds up to a fully indexed rate of 5.5 percent, which is within the loan’s 2-point annual cap. Overnight, the monthly payment goes from $1,123 to $1,483, a difference of $360. That’s a lot of grocery money. Because payments can rise so significantly, borrowers should plan carefully before taking out a 3/27 mortgage.
