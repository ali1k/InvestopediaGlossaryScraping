Unaffiliated investments are investment <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/holdings.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">holdings</a> of an insurance company that it neither controls nor shares joint ownership with. Unaffiliated investments can include stocks, bonds, property, and other assets and are often disclosed in the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-statements.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">financial statements</a> of insurers.

<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutual-insurance-company.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Insurance companies</a> use the proceeds from their <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underwriting.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">underwriting</a> activities in a number of different ways.

They set aside funds as <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/loss-reserve.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">loss reserves</a> to cover liabilities that they may incur from policyholders making a claim.﻿ They pay commissions to brokers who bring in new business, and operational expenses such as salaries, benefits, and overhead. They also allocate capital to invest in securities of various liquidities in a bid to increase the return on the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurance-premium.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">premiums</a> they receive.

Insurers need to have funds available quickly in order to cover <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liability.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">liabilities</a>. As a result, they often make short-duration investments in highly <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidasset.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">liquid assets</a> that can easily and promptly be converted into cash, alongside longer-term assets that may offer a higher return. 

Depending on the type of insurance policies underwritten, an insurer’s liability may last a few months to a few years. <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortterm.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Short-term assets</a> are considered part of the insurer’s current <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">liquidity</a>, which is used to cover policies that have a duration of less than a year.﻿

Historically, insurers would generally invest in traditional <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetclasses.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">asset classes</a> that offer steady yields such as government bonds. This approach has been complicated since the financial crisis. Now that ultra-low <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">interest rates</a> are a regular fixture, insurers have been forced to widen their nets to secure decent returns.

In most cases, this has resulted in a shift to alternative investments, including <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/privateequity.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">private equity</a> and structured finance, such as <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rmbs.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">residential mortgage-backed securities</a> (RMBS).﻿

Because these types of <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/alternative_investment.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">non-traditional investments</a> tend to be more complex, an increasing number of insurers have begun <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outsourcing.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">outsourcing</a> investment decisions to specialist investment management firms. This has been particularly the case among smaller insurers, who generally have fewer resources available to effectively manage portfolios on their own.

Insurers are required to report their financials to state insurance regulators periodically. These regulators look at <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidityratios.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">liquidity ratios</a> in order to determine how quickly an insurer will be able to pay for its policyholder liabilities, as well as to establish if the investment strategies and holdings of the insurer are likely to pose a threat to its <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/solvency.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">solvency</a>.﻿

Unaffiliated investments are included in the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/overall-liquidity-ratio.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">overall liquidity ratio</a>, though this ratio does not take into account affiliated investments. They do not, however, appear in the calculation of an insurer’s <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/combinedratio.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined ratio</a>. This is because the combined ratio looks at cash outflows—expense ratio, loss and loss-adjustment ratio, and dividend ratio—to see how much money it costs to maintain the book of business.
