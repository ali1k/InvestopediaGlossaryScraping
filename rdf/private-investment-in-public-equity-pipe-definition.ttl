Private investment in public equity (PIPE) is the buying of shares of publicly traded stock at a price below the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cmv.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">current market value</a> (CMV) per share. This buying method is a practice of investment firms, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutualfund.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">mutual funds</a>, and other large, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accreditedinvestor.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">accredited investors</a>. A traditional PIPE is one in which common or preferred stock is issued at a set price to the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="4" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investor.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">investor</a>, while a structured PIPE issues common or preferred shares of convertible debt.

The purpose of a PIPE is for the issuer of the stock to raise capital for the public company. This financing technique is more efficient than <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/secondaryoffering.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">secondary offerings</a> due to fewer regulatory issues with the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC).

A publicly-traded company may utilize a PIPE when securing funds for <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/workingcapital.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">working capital</a> to fund day-to-day operations, expansion, or <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/acquisition.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">acquisitions</a>. The company may create new stock shares or use some from its supply, but the equities never go on sale on a stock exchange.

Instead, these large investors purchase the company's stock in a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/privateplacement.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">private placement</a>, and the issuer files a resale registration statement with the SEC.

The issuing business typically obtains its funding—that is, the investors' money for the shares—within two to three weeks, rather than waiting several months or longer, as it would with a secondary stock offering. Registration of the new shares with the SEC typically becomes effective within a month of filing.

PIPE investors may purchase stock below the market price as a hedge of protection against the share price going down after news of the PIPE gets out. The discount also acts as compensation for a certain lack of <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">liquidity</a> in the shares, meaning there can be delays in selling or converting the shares to cash.

Since this offering was a PIPE, the buyers cannot sell their shares until the company files its resale registration statement with the SEC. However, an issuer generally cannot sell more than 20% of its outstanding stock at a discount without receiving prior approval from current shareholders.

A traditional PIPE agreement lets investors purchase <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commonstock.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">common stock</a> or <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/preferredstock.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">preferred stock</a> that is convertible to common shares at a predetermined price or exchange rate. If the business is merged with another or sold soon, investors may be able to receive dividends or other payoffs. Dividends are cash or stock payments from companies to their shareholders or investors. Because of these benefits, traditional PIPEs are typically priced at or near the stock’s market value.

With a structured PIPE, preferred stock or debt securities convertible to common stock are sold. If the securities contain a reset clause, new investors are shielded from downside risks, but existing stockholders are exposed to the greater risk of <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dilution.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">dilution</a> in share values. For this reason, a structured PIPE transaction may need prior stockholder approval.

Private investment in public equity carries several advantages for issuers. Large amounts of shares are typically sold to knowledgeable investors over the long term, ensuring the company secures the funding it needs. PIPEs can be particularly advantageous for small-to-medium-sized <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/publiccompany.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">public companies</a> that may have a hard time accessing <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/030415/difference-between-private-and-public-equity.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">more traditional forms of equity financing</a>.

Because PIPE shares do not need to be registered in advance with the SEC or meet all the usual federal registration requirements for public stock offerings, transactions proceed more efficiently with fewer administrative requirements.

However, on the downside, investors may sell their stock in a short amount of time, driving down the market price. If the market price drops below a set threshold, the company may have to issue additional stock at a significantly reduced price. This new share issue dilutes the value of shareholders’ investments, which can lead to a lower stock price.

<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Short sellers</a> may take advantage of the situation by repeatedly selling their shares and lowering the share price, potentially resulting in PIPE investors having majority ownership of the company. Setting a minimum share price below which no compensatory stock is issued can avoid this problem.

In February 2018, Yum! Brands(YUM), the owner of Taco Bell and KFC, announced it was <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" href="https://investors.grubhub.com/investors/press-releases/press-release-details/2018/Yum-Brands-and-Grubhub-Announce-New-US-Growth-Partnership/default.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">purchasing $200 million</a> of takeout company GrubHub's stock through a PIPE. In this case, Yum! drove the PIPE to forge a stronger partnership between the two companies to increase sales at its restaurants through pickups and delivery.

The added liquidity allowed GrubHub to grow its U.S. delivery network and to create a more seamless ordering experience for customers of both companies. GrubHub also expanded its board of directors from nine to 10, adding a representative from Yum!
