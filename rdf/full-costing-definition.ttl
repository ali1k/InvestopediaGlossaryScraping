Full costing is an <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accountingmethod.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">accounting method</a> used to determine the complete end-to-end cost of producing products or services. Also known as "full costs" or "<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/absorptioncosting.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">absorption costing</a>,” it is required in most common accounting methodologies, including <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gaap.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">generally accepted accounting principles</a> (GAAP), <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="4" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ifrs.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">International Financial Reporting Standards</a> (IFRS), and reporting standards for income tax purposes.

When using the full costing method, all <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/directcost.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">direct</a>, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixedcost.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">fixed</a>, and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/variable-overhead.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">variable overhead</a> costs are assigned to the end product.

In full costing accounting, these various expenses move with the product (or service) through <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inventoryaccounting.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">inventory accounts</a> until the product is sold. The <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incomestatement.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">income statement</a> will then recognize these as expenses under <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cogs.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">costs of goods sold<strong> </strong></a>(COGS).

The alternative to the full costing method is known as <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/variablecost.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">variable</a> or direct costing. The treatment of fixed manufacturing overhead costs, such as salaries and building leases, is <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/052515/what-are-differences-between-absorption-costing-and-variable-costing.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">the primary difference between these two different accounting styles</a>.

Companies that use variable costing separate these <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operating_expense.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">operating expenses</a> from production costs. In short, they seek to establish the expenses incurred during the manufacturing process, independent of the everyday costs of running a business.

Under the variable costing method, fixed manufacturing overhead costs are expensed during the period they are incurred. In contrast, the full costing approach recognizes fixed manufacturing overhead costs as an expense when goods or services are sold. Choosing one method over another can have sizable effects on the reporting of <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-statements.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">financial statements</a>.

One of the biggest benefits of full costing is that it complies with GAAP. Even if a company decides to use variable costing in-house, it is required by law to use full costing in any external financial statements it publishes. Full costing is also the method that a company is required to use for calculating and filing its taxes.

Factoring in all expenses provides investors and management with a complete picture of how much it costs a company to manufacture its products. Establishing the total <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unitcost.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">cost per unit</a> helps businesses to determine suitable pricing for goods and services.

Full costing presents a more accurate idea of profitability than variable costing if all of the products are not sold during the same <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accountingperiod.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">accounting period</a> when they are manufactured. This can be especially important for a company that <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rampup.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">ramps up</a> production well in advance of an anticipated seasonal increase in sales.

Full costing also has several drawbacks. For example, taking into account all expenses, including those not directly associated with production, may make it slightly harder for management to compare the profitability of different product lines.

Management teams using full costing will also find it more challenging to run <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cost-volume-profit-analysis.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">cost-volume-profit</a> (CVP) analysis, which is used to determine how many products a company must manufacture and sell to reach the point of profitability, and improve operational efficiency. If fixed costs are an especially large part of total <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/production-cost.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">production costs</a>, it is difficult to determine variations in costs that occur at different production levels.

Another major flaw of full costing is that it can potentially mislead investors. Fixed costs are not deducted from revenues unless all of the company's manufactured products are sold, meaning that a company's profit level can appear better than it actually is during a given accounting period.

In practice, neither costing method is right or wrong. Some organizations will find variable costing more effective, while others will prefer full costing. The usefulness of method selection boils down to managerial attitude, behavior, and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/organizational-structure.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">organizational design</a> as it relates to accurate input cost capture and valuation.

As more businesses move to <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jit.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">just-in-time</a> (JIT) or related streamlined production procedures and inventory systems, in many ways, direct or full costing methods lose their significance, because fewer costs and expenses are tied up in production processes.
