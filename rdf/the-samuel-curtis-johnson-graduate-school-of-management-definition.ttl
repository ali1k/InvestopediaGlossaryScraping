The Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management—often referred to simply as “Cornell Johnson”—is a graduate business school based at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. Originally founded in 1946, it received its current name following a $20 million gift by the family of businessman and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/philanthropy.asp">philanthropist</a>, Samuel Curtis Johnson.

The school is home to roughly 100 faculty members and offers a variety of well-respected programs, including a two-year <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mba.asp">Master of Business Administration (MBA)</a> program, an accelerated 1-year MBA, and a dedicated <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/executive-mba.asp">Executive MBA</a> program.

The Cornell Johnson MBA program is known for its emphasis on providing a highly immersive experience. This is achieved through <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/011316/job-or-internship-guide-college-students.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">internships</a>, case studies, and visits to relevant companies. Additionally, students are required to select an area of focus relatively early in the MBA curriculum. Examples of these areas of specialization include <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investment-banking.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">investment banking</a>, strategic operations, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalmarkets.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">capital markets</a> and asset management, and digital technology. Once chosen, students benefit from a carefully tailored curriculum of academic and hands-on experiences focused on the current <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="4" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/best_practices.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">best practices</a> and emerging challenges of that sector.

For students unable to commit to a two-year MBA, an <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/011415/when-mba-worth-it.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Accelerated MBA</a> is also available. This one-year program is oriented toward students who already have advanced degrees in a scientific or technical discipline, such as a PhD, JD, or the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/cfa-4689806" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA)</a> designation. This program allows students to take classes at Cornell University’s technology-oriented campus, Cornell Tech, in addition to their core MBA courses.

Overall, Cornell Johnson’s MBA program has historically performed very well on international <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/b-school.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">B-School</a> rankings. In 2019, for example, Forbes rated it as the 9th-best MBA program in the world, whereas U.S. News rated it at #15 worldwide in 2021.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2">﻿</span>﻿

As is typical of <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/112815/ivy-league-degree-worth-it.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ivy League schools</a>, the cost of attending Cornell Johnson is among the highest of any business school, with annual tuition of nearly $144,000 per year.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4">﻿</span>﻿ At the same time, Cornell Johnson’s graduating class of 2018 received an average starting salary roughly equal to the annual tuition cost, along with an average signing bonus of just over $30,000.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿ 

Historically, over 94% of Cornell Johnson graduates have received job offers within 3 months of graduation.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿﻿

Upon graduation, Cornell Johnson students join an alumni network over 15,000 strong. Among them are many notable members, including Ken Durr, former CEO of Chevron (<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=cvx" rel="noopener noreferrer">CVX</a>); Daniel Hesse, former CEO of Sprint Corporation (<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=s" rel="noopener noreferrer">S</a>); and Anne Chow, CEO of AT&amp;T Business.
