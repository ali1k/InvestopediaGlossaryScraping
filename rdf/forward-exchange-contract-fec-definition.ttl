A forward exchange contract (FEC) is a special type of <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otc.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">over-the-counter</a> (OTC) foreign currency (forex) transaction entered into in order to exchange currencies that are not often traded in forex markets. These may include minor currencies as well as <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockedcurrency.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">blocked</a> or otherwise inconvertible currencies. A FEC involving such a blocked currency is known as a non-deliverable forward, or NDF.

Broadly speaking, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forwardcontract.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">forward contracts</a> are contractual agreements between two parties to exchange a pair of currencies at a specific time in the future. These transactions typically take place on a date after the date that the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spottrade.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">spot contract</a> settles and are used to protect the buyer from fluctuations in currency prices.

Forward exchange contracts (FECs) are not traded on <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exchange.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">exchanges</a>, and standard amounts of <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currency.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">currency</a> are not traded in these agreements. Still, they cannot be canceled except by the mutual agreement of both parties involved.

The parties involved in the contract are generally interested in hedging a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreign-exchange.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">foreign exchange</a> position or taking a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/speculation.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">speculative</a> position. All FECs set out the currency pair, notional amount, settlement date, and delivery rate, and also stipulate that the prevailing spot rate on the fixing date be used to conclude the transaction.

The contract's rate of exchange is thus fixed and specified for a specific date in the future, allowing the parties involved to better budget for future financial projects and know in advance precisely what their income or costs from the transaction will be at the specified future date. The nature of FECs protects both parties from unexpected or adverse movements in the currencies' future <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/forex/f/forex-spot-rate.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">spot rates</a>.

Generally, forward <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exchangerate.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">exchange rates</a> for most currency pairs can be obtained for up to 12 months in the future. There are four pairs of currencies known as the "<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/forex/m/majors.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">major pairs</a>." These are the U.S. dollar and euros; the U.S. dollar and Japanese yen; the U.S. dollar and the British pound sterling; and the U.S. dollar and the Swiss franc. For these four pairs, exchange rates for a time period of up to 10 years can be obtained.

Contract times as short as a few days are also available from many providers. Although a contract can be customized, most entities won't see the full benefit of a FEC unless setting a minimum contract amount at $30,000.

The largest forward exchange markets are in the Chinese yuan (<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/forex/c/cny-china-yuan-renminbi.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">CNY</a>), Indian rupee (<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inr.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">INR</a>), South Korean won (<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/forex/k/krw-korean-won.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">KRW</a>), New Taiwan dollar (<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="4" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/forex/t/twd-taiwan-dollar.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">TWD</a>), Brazilian real (<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="5" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/forex/a/brl-brazilian-real.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">BRL</a>), and Russian ruble (<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="6" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/forex/r/rub-russian-ruble.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">RUB</a>). The largest OTC markets, meanwhile, take place in London, with active markets also in New York, Singapore, and Hong Kong. Some countries, including South Korea, have limited but restricted onshore forward markets in addition to an active <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="7" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/ndf.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">NDF</a> market.

The largest segment of FEC trading is done against the U.S. dollar (<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/usd.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">USD</a>). There are also active markets using the euro (<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eur.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">EUR</a>), the Japanese yen (<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/forex/j/jpy-japanese-yen.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">JPY</a>), and, to a lesser extent, the British pound (<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="4" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gbp.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">GBP</a>) and the Swiss franc (<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="5" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/forex/c/chf-swiss-franc.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">CHF</a>).

The forward exchange rate for a contract can be calculated using four variables:

The formula for the forward exchange rate would be:

For example, assume that the U.S. dollar (USD) and Canadian dollar (<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/forex/c/cad-canadian-dollar.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">CAD</a>) spot rate is 1.3122. The U.S. three-month rate is 0.75%, and the Canadian three-month rate is 0.25%. In this case, the three-month USD/CAD FEC rate would be calculated as:
