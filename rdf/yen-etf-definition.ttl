A yen ETF is an <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">exchange traded fund</a> (ETF) that tracks the relative value of Japan’s currency, the Japanese yen (<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/forex/j/jpy-japanese-yen.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">JPY</a>), in the foreign exchange (<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/forex/f/foreign-exchange-markets.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">forex</a>) market against a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="4" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currencybasket.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">basket</a> of other currencies or a single currency such as the U.S. dollar (<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="5" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/usd.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">USD</a>). This is achieved by investing primarily in yen-backed assets, including short-term debt instruments and bonds, or simply holding the spot currency in interest-bearing accounts.

Not too long ago, buying and selling foreign currencies was a privilege generally reserved for experienced traders with expert knowledge. ETFs helped to change that, making the forex market more accessible to the average investor.

<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currency-etf.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Currency ETFs</a> are a type of pre-packaged investment tasked with tracking a certain currency, similar to how regular ETFs seek to replicate the performance of an index. These vehicles trade on a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockmarket.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">stock exchange</a>. Like stocks, their prices fluctuate throughout the day as traders buy and sell them.

The portfolios of yen ETFs usually include yen-denominated <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futurescontract.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">futures contracts</a>, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtsecurity.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">debt securities</a>, money market funds, and cash deposits. These funds generate income for investors through the performance of the yen against other currencies as well as through interest generated by some securities in the portfolio. Some yen ETFs match the current <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/income.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">income</a> earned on the yen assets with a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="4" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividendyield.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">dividend yield</a>. Others use that income to pay the expenses of managing the ETF.

Holding investment in foreign currencies enables investors to protect themselves in case their own currency declines in value. Over the years, many have opted for the yen: the third-most widely traded currency globally, behind the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/forex/u/usd-united-states-dollar.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">USD</a> and the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/euro.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">euro</a>, and the most widely traded currency in Asia.

The yen is sometimes used to provide diversification, as it frequently trades inversely to the other major currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar. Historically, the currency, which is often used as a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reservecurrency.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">reserve currency</a> in international transactions, has even developed a reputation as a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/safe-haven.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">safe haven</a>.

Japan is the world’s largest <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditor.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">creditor</a>. There’s also a popular belief among traders that investors there tend to dump foreign holdings and bring their money back home in times of hardship, bolstering demand for the yen and, subsequently, its valuation.

The Japanese yen has customarily been a popular <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/carry-trade-definition-4682656" rel="noopener noreferrer">carry trade</a>, too, as low-interest<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer"> rates</a> make it cheap to borrow to fund risk-taking in other, higher-interest currencies.

Some investors consider currency ETFs risky, since <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/macroeconomics.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">macroeconomic</a> events affect currency values around the world, even in stable nations such as Japan. Unpredictable natural disasters can also have a big impact, an example being the Fukushima disaster in 2011, which caused a surge in the value of the yen, followed by a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/recession.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">recession.</a>

Lately, a handful of analysts have even questioned the Japanese yen’s safe-haven status, pointing to its <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trade_deficit.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">trade deficits</a>, local <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetmanagement.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">asset managers</a> buying higher-yielding foreign assets, and Japanese companies running out of decent options to deploy capital at home. The yen has also lost some of its luster as a popular carry trade as low-interest rates become commonplace among major economies.

These observations serve as a reminder that forex trading is not a market for the unprepared. Traders must be knowledgeable about major foreign currencies and stay abreast of not only the current economic stats for a country but also the underpinnings of the respective economies and the special factors that can influence the currencies, such as <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commodity.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">commodity</a> movement or interest rate changes.

Investors should keep tabs on all major economic data, including the release of <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gdp.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">gross domestic product</a> (GDP), retail sales, industrial production, inflation, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bot.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">trade balances</a>, employment figures, interest rates, including scheduled meetings of the central bank, and the daily news flow, when investing in currencies.

In the case of Japan and yen traders, the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tankan.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tankan survey</a> is particularly worth paying attention to. Tankan, an economic survey of Japanese businesses, is published by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) every quarter. It is used to formulate <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monetarypolicy.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">monetary policy</a> and, as a result, often moves trading in Japanese stock and currency.

The most popular yen ETF is the CurrencyShares Japanese Yen Trust (FXY) with $201 million in <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aum.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">assets under management</a> (AUM). FXY was first launched in 2007 by RydexSGI and seeks to mirror the price and performance of the Japanese yen relative to the USD by holding Japanese yen on deposit. The fund has an <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expenseratio.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">expense ratio</a> of 0.40 percent.

Investors looking to add yen ETFs to their <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/portfolio.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">portfolios</a> have a number of other options, too. Alternatives include the ProShares Ultra Yen ETF (YCL), ProShares UltraShort Yen ETF (YCS), and VelocityShares Daily 4x Long USD vs JPY ETN (DJPY).
