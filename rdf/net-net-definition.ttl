Net-net is a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valueinvesting.asp">value investing</a> technique developed by the economist Benjamin Graham, in which a company's stock is valued based solely on its <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/ncavps.asp">net current assets per share</a> (NCAVPS). Net-net investing thus focuses on current assets, taking cash and cash equivalents at full value, then reducing accounts receivable for doubtful accounts, and reducing inventories to liquidation values. Net-net value is calculated by deducting total liabilities from the adjusted current assets. 

Net-net should not be confused with a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/double-net-lease.asp">double net lease</a>, which is a commercial rental agreement where the tenant is responsible for both property taxes and premiums for insuring the property.

Graham used this method at a time when financial information was not as readily available, and net-nets were more accepted as a company valuation model. When a viable company is identified as a net-net, the analysis focused only on the firm’s <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentassets.asp">current assets</a> and liabilities, without taking other <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tangibleasset.asp">tangible assets</a> or long-term liabilities into account. Advances in financial data collection now allow analysts to quickly access a firm’s entire set of financial statements, ratios, and other benchmarks.

Essentially, investing in a net-net was a safe play in the short term because its current assets were worth more than its <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market-price.asp">market price</a>. In a sense, the long-term growth potential and any value from long-term assets are free to an investor in a net-net. Net-net stocks will usually be reassessed by the market and priced closer to their true value in the short term. Long term, however, net-net stocks can be problematic.

The formula for net current asset value per share (NCAVPS) is:

According to Graham, investors will benefit greatly if they invest in companies whose stock prices are no more than 67% of their NCAV per share. And, in fact, a study done by the State University of New York showed that from the period of 1970 to 1983 an investor could have earned an <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/averagereturn.asp">average return</a> of 29.4% by purchasing stocks that fulfilled Graham's requirement and holding them for one year.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"></span>

However, Graham made it clear that not all stocks chosen using the NCAVPS formula would have strong returns, and that investors should also diversify their <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/holdings.asp">holdings</a> when using this strategy. Graham recommended holding at least 30 stocks.

Current assets, which are used in the net-net approach, are defined as assets that are <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/08/pay-in-cash.asp">cash</a>, and assets that are converted into cash within 12 months, including <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accountsreceivable.asp">accounts receivable</a> and inventory. As a business sells inventory and customers submit payments, the firm reduces inventory levels and receivables. This ability to collect cash is the true value of a business, according to the net-net approach.

Current assets are reduced by <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentliabilities.asp">current liabilities</a>, such as accounts payable, to calculate net current assets. <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/longtermassets.asp">Long-term assets</a> and liabilities are excluded from this analysis, which only focuses on cash that the firm can generate within the next 12 months.

The reason net-net stocks may not be a great <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/00/082100.asp">long-term investment</a> is simply because management teams rarely choose to fully liquidate the company at the first sign of trouble. In the short term, a net-net stock may make up the gap between current assets and market cap. However, over the long term, an incompetent management team or a flawed business model can ruin a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancesheet.asp">balance sheet</a> quite rapidly. 

So a net-net stock may find itself in that position because the market has already identified long-term issues that will negatively affect that stock. For example, the rise of Amazon.com has pushed various retailers into net-net positions over time and some investors have profited in the short term. In the long term, however, many of those same stocks have gone under or been <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/acquisition.asp">acquired</a> at a discount. 

The net-net strategy of finding companies with a market value below its net-net <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/100715/why-working-capital-management-important-company.asp">working capital</a> (NNWC)—cash and short-term investments + 75% of accounts receivable + 50% of inventory - total liabilities—may be an effective strategy for small investors. Net-net companies are sought after by day traders which may contribute to their rise in month-to-month valuation.
