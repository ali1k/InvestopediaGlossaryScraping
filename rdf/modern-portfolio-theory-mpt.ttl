Modern <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/portfolio.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">portfolio</a> theory (MPT) is a theory on how risk-averse investors can construct portfolios to maximize <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expectedreturn.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">expected return</a> based on a given level of market risk. <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/harrymarkowitz.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Harry Markowitz</a> pioneered this theory in his paper "Portfolio Selection," which was published in the Journal of Finance in 1952.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿ He was later awarded a Nobel Prize for his work on modern portfolio theory.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2">﻿</span>﻿

Modern portfolio theory argues that an investment's risk and return characteristics should not be viewed alone, but should be evaluated by how the investment affects the overall portfolio's risk and return. MPT shows that an investor can construct a portfolio of multiple assets that will maximize returns for a given level of risk. Likewise, given a desired level of expected return, an investor can construct a portfolio with the lowest possible risk. Based on statistical measures such as <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/variance.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">variance</a> and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/correlation.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">correlation</a>, an individual investment's performance is less important than how it impacts the entire portfolio.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿

MPT assumes that investors are risk-averse, meaning they prefer a less risky portfolio to a riskier one for a given level of return. As a practical matter, risk aversion implies that most people should invest in multiple <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetclasses.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">asset classes</a>.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿

The expected return of the portfolio is calculated as a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/weighted.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">weighted</a> sum of the individual assets' returns. If a portfolio contained four equally weighted assets with expected returns of 4, 6, 10, and 14%, the portfolio's expected return would be:

(4% x 25%) + (6% x 25%) + (10% x 25%) + (14% x 25%) = 8.5%

The portfolio's risk is a complicated function of the variances of each asset and the correlations of each pair of assets. To calculate the risk of a four-asset portfolio, an investor needs each of the four assets' variances and six correlation values, since there are six possible two-asset combinations with four assets. Because of the asset correlations, the total portfolio risk, or <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standarddeviation.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">standard deviation</a>, is lower than what would be calculated by a weighted sum.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿

MPT is <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/managing-wealth/modern-portfolio-theory-why-its-still-hip/" rel="noopener noreferrer">a useful tool</a> for investors trying to build <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/diversification.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">diversified</a> portfolios. In fact, the growth of exchange traded funds (<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">ETFs</a>) made MPT more relevant by giving investors easier access to different asset classes. Stock investors can use MPT to reduce risk by putting a small portion of their portfolios in <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="4" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/080515/top-4-us-government-bonds-etfs.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">government bond ETFs</a>. The variance of the portfolio will be significantly lower because government bonds have a negative correlation with stocks. Adding a small investment in Treasuries to a stock portfolio will not have a large impact on expected returns because of this loss reducing effect.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿

Similarly, MPT can be used to reduce the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volatility.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">volatility</a> of a U.S. Treasury portfolio by putting 10% in a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/020416/5-best-us-small-cap-value-index-mutual-funds.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">small-cap value index fund</a> or ETF. Although small-cap value stocks are far riskier than Treasuries on their own, they often do well during periods of high <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">inflation</a> when bonds do poorly. As a result, the portfolio's overall volatility is lower than one consisting entirely of government bonds. Furthermore, the expected returns are higher.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿

Modern portfolio theory allows investors to construct more efficient portfolios. Every possible combination of assets that exists can be plotted on a graph, with the portfolio's risk on the X-axis and the expected return on the Y-axis. This plot reveals the most desirable portfolios. For example, suppose Portfolio A has an expected return of 8.5% and a standard deviation of 8%. Further, assume that Portfolio B has an expected return of 8.5% and a standard deviation of 9.5%. Portfolio A would be deemed more efficient because it has the same expected return but lower risk.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿

It is possible to draw an upward sloping curve to connect all of the most efficient portfolios. This curve is called the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/efficientfrontier.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">efficient frontier</a>. Investing in a portfolio underneath the curve is not desirable because it does not maximize returns for a given level of risk.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿

Perhaps the most serious criticism of MPT is that it evaluates portfolios based on variance rather than <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/downsiderisk.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">downside risk</a>. Two portfolios that have the same level of variance and returns are considered equally desirable under modern portfolio theory. One portfolio may have that variance because of frequent small losses. In contrast, the other could have that variance because of rare spectacular declines. Most investors would prefer frequent small losses, which would be easier to endure. Post-modern portfolio theory (<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pmpt.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">PMPT</a>) attempts to improve on modern portfolio theory by minimizing downside risk instead of variance.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"></span>

Modern portfolio theory, introduced by Harry Markowitz in 1952, is a portfolio construction theory that determines the minimum level of risk for an expected return. It assumes that investors will favor a portfolio with a lower risk level over a higher risk level for the same level of return. A central part of modern portfolio theory is how an individual security impacts the risk and return profile of an entire portfolio. 

Modern portfolio theory can be used as a means to diversify portfolios. By integrating a diverse set of assets a portfolio can reduce its variance. Another benefit of modern portfolio theory is that it can be used to reduce volatility. By introducing assets in a portfolio that have a negative correlation, such as U.S. treasuries and small-cap stocks, a portfolio could realize stronger returns rather than exclusively holding one type of asset within a portfolio. Ultimately, modern portfolio theory is used to create the most efficient portfolio possible.

The efficient frontier, a cornerstone of modern portfolio theory, shows the set of portfolios that provide the highest level of return for the lowest level of risk. When a portfolio falls to the right of the efficient frontier, they possess greater risk relative to their return. Conversely, when a portfolio falls beneath the slope of the efficient frontier, they offer a lower level of return relative to risk.
