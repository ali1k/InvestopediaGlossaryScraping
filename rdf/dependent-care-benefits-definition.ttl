Dependent care benefits are provided by an employer to an employee for use in caring for <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dependent.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">dependents</a>, such as young children or disabled family members. Dependent care benefits may include <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/flexiblespendingaccount.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">flexible spending accounts</a> (FSAs), paid leave, and certain tax credits and can be worth thousands of dollars to eligible participants.

Dependents, according to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), are treated as an exemption credit that may be claimed on an annual tax return. On its own, the dependent credit can reduce a filer's taxable income by thousands of dollars. Children are the most commonly claimed dependent, though dependent care benefits may be extended to a variety of people given that they meet several stipulations. For example, dependents may also be relatives, roommates, or even romantic partners. The IRS provides a guide on who may be claimed as a dependent.

Dependent care benefits are available to individuals whose children are cared for by a daycare facility or provider. Such benefits may take the form of <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/childtaxcredit.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">childcare tax credits</a> or a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dependent-care-fsa.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">dependent care flexible spending account</a>. Each provides tax savings based on money spent on childcare.

Dependent care benefits are part of an overall employee benefits system as administered by the IRS. <span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿

A dependent care flexible spending account is available for individuals who care for a child or adult who is incapable of self-care, who lives in the taxpayer's home for at least eight hours each day, and who can be claimed as a dependent on an income tax return. These accounts allow individuals to pay for qualified child and dependent care expenses while lowering their taxable income.

Such FSAs are set up by an employer. Participants authorize their employers to withhold a specified amount from their paychecks each pay period and deposit the money in an account. Instead of using the FSA money to pay for expenses directly, those costs are paid <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outofpocket.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">out-of-pocket</a>, and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reimbursablecosts.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">reimbursement</a> for those expenses must be applied for.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5">﻿</span>﻿

The Child and Dependent Credit is a tax credit available to taxpayers who paid for the care of their child, spouse, or dependent so they can work or look for work. The IRS maintains a comprehensive information page related to the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" href="https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc602" rel="noopener noreferrer">Child and Dependent Care Credit informational page</a>, which includes eligibility and timing requirements, how much can be claimed, and information on which forms to complete. This tax credit (not a deduction) reduces the tax burden dollar for dollar.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿

More and more employers are making paid family leave available to their workers. Nine states (California, Colorado, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Washington) and the District of Columbia offer paid family and medical leave (PFML). Hawaii provides paid medical leave in the form of temporary disability insurance.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2">﻿</span>﻿ Most workers are eligible for the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/family-and-medical-leave-act.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Family and Medical Leave Act</a> (FMLA), which offers up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave per year to care for family members.
