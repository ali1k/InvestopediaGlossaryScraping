The expected return is the profit or loss that an <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investor.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">investor</a> anticipates on an investment that has known historical <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rateofreturn.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">rates of return</a> (RoR). It is calculated by multiplying potential outcomes by the chances of them occurring and then totaling these results. Expected return calculations are a key piece of both business operations and financial theory, including in the well-known models of modern portfolio theory (<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/modernportfoliotheory.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">MPT</a>) or the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="4" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blackscholes.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">black-scholes</a> options pricing model.

For example, if an investment has a 50% chance of gaining 20% and a 50% chance of losing 10%, the expected return would be 5% = (50% x 20% + 50% x -10% = 5%).

The expected return is a tool used to determine whether an investment has a positive or negative average net outcome. The sum is calculated as the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expected-value.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">expected value</a> (EV) of an investment given its potential returns in different scenarios, as illustrated by the following formula:

where: "i" indicates each known return and its respective probability in the series

The expected return is usually based on historical data and is therefore not guaranteed into the future; however, it does often set reasonable expectations. Therefore, the expected return figure can be though of as a long-term weighted average of <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/historical-returns.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">historical returns</a>.

In the formulation above, for instance, the 5% expected return may never be realized in the future, as the investment is inherently subject to <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/systematicrisk.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">systematic</a> and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unsystematicrisk.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">unsystematic</a> risks. Systematic risk the danger to a market sector or the entire market whereas unsystematic risk applies to a specific company or industry.

When considering individual investments or portfolios, a more formal equation for expected return of a financial investment is:

where:

In essence, this formula states that the expected return in excess of the risk-free rate of return depends on the investment's beta, or relative volatility compared to the broader market.

Note that it can be quite dangerous to make naive investment decisions based entirely on expected return calculations. Before making any investment decisions, one should always <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskreturntradeoff.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">review the risk characteristics</a> of investment opportunities to determine if the investments align with their portfolio goals.

For example, assume two hypothetical investments exist. Their annual performance results for the last five years are:

Both of these investments have expected returns of exactly 8%. However, when analyzing the risk of each, as defined by the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standarddeviation.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">standard deviation</a>, Analyst use standard deviation to reveal historical volatility in investments. Investment A is approximately five times riskier than Investment B. That is, Investment A has a standard deviation of 12.6% and Investment B has a standard deviation of 2.6%.

In addition to expected returns, wise investors should also consider the likelihood of a return to better assess risk. After all, one can find instances where certain <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lottery.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">lotteries</a> offer a positive expected return, despite the very low chances of realizing that return.

The expected return does not just apply to a single <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">security</a> or asset. It can also be expanded to analyze a portfolio containing many investments. If the expected return for each investment is known, the portfolio's overall <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/072715/how-do-i-calculate-expected-return-my-portfolio-excel.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">expected return</a> is a weighted average of the expected returns of its components.

For example, let's assume we have an investor interested in the tech sector. His portfolio contains the following stocks:

With a total portfolio value of $1 million the weights of Alphabet, Apple, and Amazon in the portfolio are 50%, 20%, and 30%, respectively.

Thus, the expected return of the total portfolio is 11.4%:

Expected return and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standarddeviation.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">standard deviation</a> are two statistical measures that can be used to analyze a portfolio. The expected return of a portfolio is the anticipated amount of returns that a portfolio may generate, making it the mean (average) of the portfolio's possible return distribution; whereas the standard deviation of a portfolio measures the amount that the returns deviate from its mean, making it a proxy for the portfolio's risk.
