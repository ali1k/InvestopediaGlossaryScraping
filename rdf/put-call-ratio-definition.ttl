The put-call ratio is the ratio of the trading volume of <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/putoption.asp">put options</a> to <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp">call options</a> and is used as an indicator of investor sentiment in the markets.

A put is a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/derivative.asp">derivative</a> instrument that gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to sell a specified amount of an <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underlying-security.asp">underlying security</a> at a pre-determined price within a specified time frame. A call works in the same way, but gives its holder the right to buy rather than sell.

Holders of puts are expecting (or <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedge.asp">hedging</a> against) the price of the security to go down. Owners of calls, on the other hand, are expecting (or <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/speculation.asp">speculating</a> on) the price of the security to go up.

The put-call ratio provides information about relative <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/technical/02/010702.asp">trading volumes</a> of an underlying security's put options to its call options. It has long been viewed as an indicator of investor <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketsentiment.asp">sentiment</a> in the markets, where a large proportion of puts to calls indicates bearish sentiment, and vice versa.

Technical traders use the put-call ratio as an indicator of performance and as a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/barometer.asp">barometer</a> of overall market sentiment. Put-call ratios on broader indexes such as the S&amp;P 500 are also used as more general gauges of market climate.

The put-call ratio shows an underlying security's put volume relative to its call volume over a period of time (typically a day or week) and is calculated simply by dividing put volume by call volume. When there are more <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/open-position.asp">open positions</a> in puts than calls, the ratio is calculated to be above 1. Likewise, when call volume is higher, the ratio is less than 1.

One way to interpret the put-call ratio is to say that a higher ratio means it's time to sell and a lower ratio means it's time to buy. That's because when the ratio is high it <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/trading/forecasting-market-direction-with-put-call-ratios/">suggests</a> that people are either expecting or protecting more readily against a future decline in the price of the underlying. A put-call ratio between 0.5 and 1 is considered a sideways trend in the markets.

Some also view the put-call ratio as a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/contrarian.asp">contrarian</a> indicator. Traders know that derivatives are used to do more than place bets; they are used as hedges and insurance. If there's a lot of insurance being placed to the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sellside.asp">sell side</a>, it means traders are worried about prices falling.

Some traders buy when the put-call ratio is above 1, meaning the market is out of balance to the sell side, and sell when the put-call ratio is below 1, meaning the market is out of balance to the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/buyside.asp">buy side</a>. These traders are looking to make money on the correction. The interpretation of the ratio is left to the analyst's or trader's <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investment-philosophy.asp">investment philosophy</a>.

Sheila is a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trader.asp">trader</a> who uses put-call ratios as a tool to aid in her contrarian investment strategy. She buys on days when the put-call ratio is above 1 (or a majority of traders are selling) and sells on days when the put-call ratio is below 1 (or a majority of traders are buying).
