A 1099-R form is one of many forms in the 1099 series. All of these forms are known as information returns and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/082514/purpose-1099-forms.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">are used to report</a> various types of income—other than their salary—that a person may receive, such as independent contractor income, interest and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">dividends</a>, or government payments.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8">﻿</span>﻿

According to the IRS, a payee who receives any of the following <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/distribution.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">distributions</a> of $10 or more from the accounts listed below is required to fill out a 1099-R form:<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2">﻿</span>﻿

On the other hand, an individual who receives a 1099-R form in error should immediately contact the plan <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/custodian.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">custodian</a> to rectify the situation and avoid filing an incorrect tax return.

If you receive a 1099-R, keep in mind that not all distributions from retirement or <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxdeferred.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">tax-deferred</a> accounts are subject to tax.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2">﻿</span>﻿ A <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/directrollover.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">direct rollover</a> from a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/401kplan.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">401(k) plan</a> to an IRA is one example. If you are unsure whether a distribution is taxable it may be a good idea to consult with a tax professional.

The form is provided by the plan issuer who must give a copy to the IRS, the recipient of the distribution, and the recipient’s state, city, or local tax department.

Some of the other items included on the form are the gross distribution paid during the tax year, the amount of taxable distribution, the federal income tax withheld at source, any contributions made to the investment, or insurance premiums paid, and a code representing the type of distributions made to the plan holder.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2">﻿</span>﻿

Form 1099-R is one of many different types of 1099 forms, collectively referred to as the information return forms.

Although there are approximately 16 types of information returns, most taxpayers will only ever receive a handful of them. Here are the most common Form 1099s.
