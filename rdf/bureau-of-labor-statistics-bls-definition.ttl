    invp:description """
The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is a federal agency that collects and disseminates various data about the U.S. economy and labor market. Its reports include the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumerpriceindex.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Consumer Price Index</a> (CPI) and the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/ppi.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Producer Price Index</a> (PPI), both of which are considered to be important measures of inflation.

The primary purpose of the BLS, an arm of the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dol.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">U.S. Department of Labor</a> (DOL), is to research, assemble, and publish a range of statistical data on the labor market, prices, and productivity. This government agency goes to great lengths to ensure the accuracy, impartiality, and accessibility of its reports and the statistics it produces are among the most influential <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economic_indicator.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">economic indicators</a> for the American economy.

BLS data is frequently cited by the media and relied on by businesses, academics, and policymakers to inform their decision making. It's also closely watched by <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economist.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">economists</a> and market participants, who consult the bureau's releases to generate better and more accurate predictions for how the economy and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">markets</a> will perform in the future.

Some of the most important statistical releases published by the BLS include:

The BLS was first established as a branch of the Department of the Interior in 1884 with a mandate to research and compile information about economics and labor. For nearly 15 years, it subsequently operated as an independent department, before being incorporated into the short-lived Department of Commerce and Labor in 1903.

That move only lasted a decade. When the Department of Commerce and Labor was renamed the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/department-of-commerce.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Department of Commerce</a> (DOC) in 1913, the BLS, along with other bureaus and agencies concerned with labor, was then transferred into the newly-created DOL, a US cabinet-level agency responsible for enforcing federal labor standards and promoting workers' wellbeing.
