A generation gap refers to the chasm that separates the thoughts expressed by members of two different generations. More specifically, a generation gap can be used to describe the differences in actions, beliefs, and tastes exhibited by members of younger generations versus older ones.

The subjects at hand may be vast and varied but can include politics, values, and pop culture. While generation <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gap.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">gaps</a> have been prevalent throughout all periods of history, the breadth of differences of these gaps has widened in the 20th and 21st centuries.

Generation gaps play big roles in businesses because, in order to succeed, companies must find ways to balance the needs and views of individuals from different age groups. Businesses must be cognizant of the fact that changing demographics of their <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/client-base.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">client base</a>, including the typical genders of their patrons, can drastically affect their <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/businesscycle.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">business cycles</a> and bottom lines.

The term "generation gap" was first used in the 1960s. During that time, the younger generation in question—commonly referred to as “<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/baby_boomer.asp">baby boomers</a>”—showed a significant difference in their beliefs and opinions, compared to that of their parent's generation.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"></span>

Sociologists use nomenclature to refer to different generational segments. For example, Gen Z, which are those individuals born between 1996 and 2012 are called “technology natives” because they have lived with digital technology their entire lives, and this is all they’ve ever known.

By contrast, older generational members, known as “digital immigrants,” tend to be less comfortable with personal usage of technology. Consequently, technology companies market products differently to each group.

The current living generations have been divided into the following four major groups:

Each generation has its own characteristics regarding vernacular, technological influences, workplace attitudes, general consciousness, and ways of life.

As <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/great_depression.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Great Depression</a> and World War II survivors, they were instrumental in shaping the United States into an economic and military power. This group is defined by patriotism, teamwork, and drive. Traditionalists tend to obey rules and respect authority.

They witnessed increasing social and economic equality and came of age as the country was split by differing views on politics, war, and social justice. The boomers participated in some of the greatest social changes in the country’s history, during the 1960s and 1970s, with the Civil Rights Movement and the Women’s Movement.

Born between 1965 and 1980, Gen-Xers grew up with emerging technologies and political and institutional incompetence. They witnessed Watergate, Three Mile Island, and the Iranian hostage crisis. But they also observed major technological advancements. Mimeograph machines evolved into high-speed copiers, and fax machines gave way to email. Heavy adding machines were replaced by handheld calculators, and computers shrank in size and processing speed.

Born between 1981 and 1996, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/millennial.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">millennials</a> have always known cable TV, pagers, answering machines, laptop computers, and video games. Technological advancements in real-time media and communication have driven their expectation for immediacy. They are the generation that bridges the gap of growing up in a world before and after the Internet.

They have also seen untold tragedy in their youth, with events like the Columbine High School shootings of 1999 and the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Millennials also suffered greatly during the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/great-recession.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Great Recession</a>, significantly impacting the long-term outlook of their finances.

Generation Z is the generation after the millennials, born between 1996 and 2012. This generation consists of individuals in young adulthood, teenagers, and children. This is the first generation that grew up with the Internet in its full force, not knowing a world without email, immediate access to information, or mobile phones.

Generation Z was expected to do well financially, coming of age in a strong economy, however, that was quickly thrown into disarray due to the Coronavirus pandemic and subsequent economic fallout. This generation is racially and ethnically diverse and is similar to millennials in terms of their social and policy beliefs. Both generations are progressive, believe in social equality, and the importance of climate change.

Understanding the different generations is critical for businesses to know who they should <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketing.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">market</a> to and how. The first step is understanding the product or service offered by your business and who its <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/target-market.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">target audience</a> is. From there, learning the best way to market to them, without involving any stereotypes, is an important step to success.

One of the key things to remember is to stay true to your identity. If your company is not perceived as hip or young, then using hip or young lingo to market to Generation Z, for example, will be seen as inauthentic and will backfire.

Millennials and baby boomers are the largest generations. Baby boomers are also the wealthiest while millennials are reaching middle age and will have more wealth to spend. Understanding these types of characteristics of a generation will help in marketing. Also, knowing what these generations need at a certain point will help.

For example, baby boomers are nearing <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/retirement.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">retirement</a> or are retired, so aspects of retirement in a product may appeal to them. Millennials are still fairly young, in their mid-twenties to forties, so addressing topics such as buying a house or first car or starting a family may appeal to them.

In addition, a business needs to know where to market. Baby boomers grew up in an age without smartphones or the Internet. Though many are tech-savvy, many also still read physical newspapers and watch cable TV. If you are marketing to baby boomers, that might be an area to consider.

On the other hand, Generation Z grew up with smartphones and tablets in hand, so marketing digitally to them would be the smart move.

A generation gap is the thoughts, beliefs, and ideologies that separate one generation from the next. These can encompass beliefs on politics, business, race, and pop culture.

Generational gaps are simply caused by age and the situation of the world at the time one generation has grown up. For example, the generation that grew up during World War II will have different beliefs and perceptions than those that grew up in the 1960s.

Some of the different generation gaps are the traditionalists, the baby boomers, Generation X, millennials, and Generation Z.

There are many studies conducted on this topic. There will always be different generations, simply because people will be born at different times. Similarly, the world and society are always changing, which will inadvertently change the perception of individuals depending on the period they grew up in. Studies do also show that the differences in generational gaps are minimal. Individual differences also play a role, as do socio-economic factors.

There are ways to solve the generational gap in certain situations, like the workforce. Methods include encouraging multi-generational teamwork, creating clear cultural values, such as highlighting the importance of the quality of the work rather than where the work is done (office versus remotely), incorporating many communication channels that work for all individuals, organizing mentorship programs, and emphasizing respect above all else.

A generation gap consists of the differing beliefs on politics, religion, society, pop culture, that exist between different generations. These beliefs are shaped by the state of the world in which the individuals belonging to each generation grew up.

Businesses often try to understand the different generations so that they can create and market products successfully. Businesses also try and understand these differences to close the generation gap amongst their employees, for a more cohesive and efficient workplace.
