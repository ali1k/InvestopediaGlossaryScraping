Investment advisory representatives (IARs) are licensed and authorized personnel who work for investment advisory companies and are permitted to work with clients. The primary responsibility of an IAR is to provide investment-related advice as a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/personal-financial-advisor.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">financial advisor</a> or <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financialplanner.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">financial planner</a>.

In order to become IARs, individuals must pass the appropriate licensing exam or exams and register with the appropriate regulatory bodies.

<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/uniformsecuritiesact.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Uniform Securities Act</a> defines the term investment advisor representative (IAR) as:

<cite>"An individual employed by or associated with an investment advisor or federal-covered investment advisor and who makes any recommendations or otherwise gives investment advice regarding securities, manages accounts or portfolios of clients, determines which recommendation or advice regarding securities should be given, provides investment advice or holds herself or himself out as providing investment advice, receives compensation to solicit, offer, or negotiate for the sale of or for selling investment advice, or supervises employees who perform any of the foregoing.<em>"</em></cite><span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿﻿

IARs, as the name suggests, are representatives of investment advisory firms. They are typically tasked with duties and roles that would cast them as financial advisors and/or financial planners and often work with individual clients to help them achieve their financial goals and build investment <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/portfolio.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">portfolios</a>.

More specifically, IARs commonly engage in the following:

An employee of an investment firm who does not directly engage in financial advice or investment recommendations to clients would not need to register as an IAR. This includes support staff, administrators, secretaries, etc.

It is essential for RIA firms to ensure their IARs are registered correctly to avoid significant penalties. The first step in the registration process is to create an account with the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investment-adviser-registration-depository-iard.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Investment Adviser Registration Depository</a> (IARD), which is managed by the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/finra.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Financial Industry Regulatory Authority</a> (FINRA) on behalf of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and states.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿﻿﻿﻿ There are a few states that do not require this, so advisors who only do business in those states do not have to use this system.

Once the account is open, FINRA will supply the advisor or firm with a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/crd.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Central Registration Depository</a> (CRD) number and account ID information. With this, the firm can then file <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/form_adv.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Form ADV</a> and the U4 forms with either the SEC or states.

According to regulations, IARs can only offer advice on topics for which they have passed the appropriate examinations. In addition to obtaining the minimum qualifications, they must register with a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/ria.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">registered investment advisor</a> (RIA) firm and the proper state authorities.

IARs register in the state in which they provide investment advice; they do not require <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/securities-and-exchange-commission-sec/" rel="noopener noreferrer">SEC</a> registration. In the majority of states, IARs are required to file Form U4, which is the Uniform Application for Securities Industry Registration. The form then gets filed on the CRD system.

To expand their knowledge of financial products and principles, many IARs go above and beyond by acquiring either the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cfp.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Certified Financial Planner</a> (CFP) or <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cfa.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chartered Financial Analyst</a> (CFA) designations.

IARs in most states are typically required to pass the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/series63.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Series 63</a> and/or <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/series65.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Series 65 exams</a>. <span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿﻿﻿﻿ The FINRA administered exam consists of 130 scored questions which candidates have 180 minutes to complete.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2">﻿</span>﻿﻿﻿﻿ As an alternative to passing the Series 65 exam, IARs may pass the <a class="pseudoStyle" data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/series66.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Series 66</a> and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="4" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/series7.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Series 7</a> exams.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿﻿﻿﻿

Some states allow for the substitution of licensing credentials. For example, an individual may not have to pass the Series 65 exam if they hold a CFP designation. IARs may also have continuing education requirements depending on their jurisdiction.
