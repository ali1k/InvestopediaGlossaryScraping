The term hobby loss refers to a loss that results from a business deemed to be a recreational activity or hobby by the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irs.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Internal Revenue Service</a> (IRS). Taxpayers cannot claim and recoup this money when the agency says it is spent while pursuing a hobby. That's because losses aren't allowed for <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expense.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">expenses</a> in excess of hobby <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/income.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">income</a>.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10">﻿</span>﻿ This means these expenses aren't deductible as they are with a business.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10">﻿</span>﻿

Expenses are an expected part of running a business—you have to spend money to make money. Expenses that are necessary to carry on a trade or business, incurred to produce income, or paid for <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investment.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">investments</a> in your company are <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deductible.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">deductible</a>. When, despite a profit motive, your overall expenses exceed your earnings, the loss can offset unrelated income.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12">﻿</span>﻿

Any income you earn is taxable and must be claimed, even if it doesn't come from your employer. This includes any part-time and temporary work, side gigs, and recreational pursuits that lead you to make a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profit.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">profit</a>.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10">﻿</span>﻿ Expenses related to these activities that result in a loss are generally deductible. That is, of course, unless the IRS considers your activity to be a hobby.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9">﻿</span>﻿

The hobby loss rule of the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/internal-revenue-code.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Internal Revenue Code</a> (IRC) attempts to curb perceived loss deduction abuses by hobbyists. The hobby loss rule applies to individuals, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/subchapters.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">S corporations</a>, trusts, estates, and partnerships, but not to C corporations. <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deduction.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deductions</a> are, therefore, limited for activities not engaged in for profit.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5">﻿</span>﻿

According to the IRS, it applies the hobby loss rule to disallow losses of activities it finds likely not to be engaged in for profit. Profit must be demonstrated for three out of five consecutive tax years. Some activities, such as horse racing, have slightly different requirements. <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxpayer.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Taxpayers</a> engaged in these activities must establish a profit motive to avoid the hobby loss limitations.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7">﻿</span>﻿ Proof of profit motives include <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/receipt.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">receipts</a> and detailed recordkeeping, which is a good idea for every taxpayer in any situation.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="17">﻿</span>﻿

The IRS published a tip sheet to help taxpayers distinguish between hobbies and legitimate business operations.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10">﻿</span>﻿ Prior to the 2018 <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxyear.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">tax year</a>, you were allowed to claim itemized deductions as itemized on Schedule A of <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/1040.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Form 1040</a>, assuming you were engaged in a hobby and not a covert or nascent business. The deductions were required to be taken as follows and only to the extent state in the following categories:

In 2017, President Donald Trump signed the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/taxes/how-gop-tax-bill-affects-you/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tax Cuts and Jobs Act</a> into law. The 200-page law went into effect on Jan. 1, 2018, and made sweeping changes to the tax law, including changes in the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxbracket.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">tax bracket</a>, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortgageinterest.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">mortgage interest</a> deductions, medical expenses, miscellaneous expenses, and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="4" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/itemizeddeduction.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">itemized deductions</a>.

So how does this affect hobbyists? Once the TCJA was signed, any expenses or hobby losses that a taxpayer was able to claim to reduce their hobby income in previous tax years are no longer allowed. This applies to tax returns filed between the 2018 and 2025 tax years.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="17">﻿</span>﻿

Although the TCJA eliminated miscellaneous itemized deductions, it's still important to know how to avoid the hobby loss rule if provisions aren't made after the 2025 tax year. The easiest way to avoid the hobby loss rules is to frequently turn a profit. The hobby loss rule presumes that an activity is for-profit if the operation is profitable for three out of the previous five years ending with the current taxable year. For actions involving horses, the timeframe is two of the previous seven years.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9">﻿</span>﻿

If the presumption is not met, then the taxpayer must establish a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profit-motive.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">profit motive</a>. The following nine factors define hobby income and losses:

A taxpayer that fails to turn a profit or to establish a profit motive is not engaged in a business. The hobby loss rules will apply. Hobby expenses that fail its three-tier deduction system are not deductible.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15">﻿</span>﻿ Hobby expenses that exceed hobby income are disallowed as non-deductible hobby losses.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10">﻿</span>﻿
