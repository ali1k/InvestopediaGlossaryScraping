Warm calling is the solicitation of a potential customer with whom a sales representative in particular, or his firm in general, has had prior contact. It refers to a sales call, visit or email that is preceded by some sort of contact with the prospect, such as a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/direct-mail.asp">direct mail</a> campaign, an introduction at a business event or a referral.

Warm calling is the opposite of <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coldcalling.asp">cold calling</a>â€”the solicitation of prospects who were not anticipating such an interaction, with whom the sales representative or business has not had prior contact.

Warm calling tends to have a personalized element since the prior contact can be referenced or mentioned (such as "Hi, Mrs. Jones, I saw you followed our company on Twitter" or "Hi, Mr. Jones, we met last week at the ABC Conference").

Warm calling works best on prospects that check all the customer suitability boxes even though they have not expressed any interest in a product or service yet.

Modern social media portals such as <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/042414/what-makes-linkedin-different-facebook-and-twitter.asp">LinkedIn</a>, Twitter, and Facebook also allow opportunities for potential clients to reach out indirectly or directly to businesses by posting comments on a blog, sharing an article with a peer or tweeting something that is of interest.

Although an easy introduction exists to break the ice with the prospect, successful warm calling still takes a significant amount of effort. Here are a few tips:
