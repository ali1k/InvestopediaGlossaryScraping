Word-of-mouth marketing (WOM marketing) is when a consumer's interest in a company's product or service is reflected in their daily dialogues. Essentially, is it is free advertising triggered by customer experiencesâ€”and usually, something that goes beyond what they expected. Word-of-mouth <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketing.asp">marketing</a> can be encouraged through different publicity activities set up by companies, or by having opportunities to encourage consumer-to-consumer and consumer-to-marketer communications. Also referred to as "WOMM" or "word-of-mouth advertising," WOM marketing includes buzz, viral, blog, emotional, and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/social-media-marketing-smm.asp">social media marketing</a>.

Word-of-mouth marketing differs from natural word-of-mouth references to a company's products and services in how it may come as the result of a promotion, encouragement, or other influence by a company, otherwise known as "seeding." When a diner has a wonderful time at a restaurant because their expectations were exceeded and later tells tweets about it, or when someone had a great experience using a product in a new way and tells everyone they know about it, those are examples of word-of-mouth marketing. Also, word-of-mouth marketing does not stop at the first interaction; it tends to lead to a cascade of follow-on interactions.

The encouragement on the part of a company may take one of several forms. The best way is to give them a reason to talk, such as exceeding expectations or providing insider skills or information about a product. Other strategies include offering consumers new ways to share information about a company's products and services, and engaging and interacting with the consumer, such as through exemplary customer service. This is especially valuable with social media-based <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/customer-service.asp">customer service</a>, which provides for seamless sharing and promotion.

Consumers are more emotionally bonded to a company when they feel they are listened to by the company. That is why many companies will have sales representatives discuss their products and services with consumers personally or through a feedback phone line. This kind of interaction, as well as promotional events, can stimulate conversations about a company's product.

There is a significant temptation to fabricate word-of-mouth marketing. Accordingly, the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" href="http://womma.org/" rel="nofollow">Word of Mouth Marketing Association (WOMMA)</a> has crafted a code of ethics for the industry, the best word-of-mouth marketing strategies are "credible, social, repeatable, measurable, and respectful" and there is no excuse for dishonesty.
