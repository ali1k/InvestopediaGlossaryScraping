When taxpayers borrow money, the lenders charge them interest on the loans. This interest represents a cost of borrowing to the borrower, who can be an individual, a business, or a government agency. Individuals and businesses can borrow money by taking out loans from a bank. Likewise, businesses and federal and municipal governments can borrow money by issuing bonds to investors.

Financial institutions pay interest to account holders as compensation for the bank's use of the deposited funds. The interest received by the investors or lenders is <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxableincome.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">taxable income</a> and must be reported to the IRS.
