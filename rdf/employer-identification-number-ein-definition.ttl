An Employer Identification Number (EIN) is a unique identification number that is assigned to a business entity so that it can easily be identified by the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irs.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Internal Revenue Service (IRS)</a>.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿ It is commonly used by employers for the purpose of reporting taxes.

The EIN is also known as a Federal Tax Identification Number. When it is used to identify a corporation for tax purposes, it is commonly referred to as a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tax-indentification-number-tin.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tax Identification Number (TIN)</a>.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2">﻿</span>﻿

Just as the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/ssn.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Social Security Number (SSN)</a> is used to identify the individual residents of the United States, the EIN is issued to identify the business entities in the country. The EIN is a unique nine-digit number issued by the IRS and includes information about which state in which the corporation is registered.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿

The digits of an EIN are formatted as follows: XX-XXXXXXX. The IRS uses the EIN to identify taxpayers that are required to file various business tax returns.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿

Business entities looking to operate in the U.S. must apply for an EIN by phone, online, fax, or by mail. All forms of businesses can apply for and be issued EINs, entities such as <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/llc.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">limited liability companies (LLCs)</a>, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/soleproprietorship.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">sole proprietorships</a>, non-profit organizations, government agencies, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/subchapters.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">S corporations</a>, partnerships, estates, and trusts, etc. Furthermore, the IRS is not biased towards the size of the company as a company with only one employee is as eligible for an EIN as a multinational corporation.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4">﻿</span>﻿

Applying for an EIN costs nothing and an application form available on the IRS website can easily be filled and submitted electronically. Once the online information has been validated, an EIN is assigned immediately. A business must be located in the U.S. or U.S. Territories to apply for an EIN online.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6">﻿</span>﻿

A business needs an EIN in order to pay employees and to file business tax returns. Furthermore, financial institutions such as banks, credit unions, and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brokerage-company.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">brokerage houses</a> will not open an account for a corporation without an EIN. Self-employed individuals such as <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/subcontracting.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">subcontractors</a> are typically required to have an EIN, which will be used by the primary contractor to report to the IRS all business income paid to the subcontractor.

Employer Identification Numbers are unique to the businesses to which they are assigned. The numbers never expire, and the same number set is never reissued to another business, even if the original employer goes out of business.

Businesses that have changed their ownership structure usually must apply for a new EIN.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5">﻿</span>﻿ For example, sole proprietors who plan to incorporate their business must apply for a new EIN.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7">﻿</span>﻿ Depending on the nature of the particular taxpayer, the EIN may or may not be the TIN used by the IRS. For sole proprietors, the TIN is their Social Security number or an employer identification number. For corporations, partnerships, trusts, and estates, this number is an EIN.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2">﻿</span>﻿
