Human resource planning (HRP) is the continuous process of systematic planning ahead to achieve optimum use of an organization's most valuable asset—quality employees. <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/humanresources.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Human resources</a> planning ensures the best fit between employees and jobs while avoiding manpower shortages or surpluses.

There are four key steps to the HRP process. They include analyzing present labor supply, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forecasting.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">forecasting</a> labor demand, balancing projected labor demand with supply, and supporting organizational goals. HRP is an important investment for any business as it allows companies to remain both productive and profitable.

Human resource planning allows companies to plan ahead so they can maintain a steady supply of skilled employees. That's why it is also referred to as workforce planning. The process is used to help companies evaluate their needs and to plan ahead to meet those needs.

<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/020615/what-tools-do-companies-use-human-resources-planning.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Human resource planning</a> needs to be flexible enough to meet short-term staffing challenges while adapting to changing conditions in the business environment over the longer term. HRP starts by assessing and auditing the current capacity of human resources.

The challenges to HRP include forces that are always changing, such as employees getting sick, getting promoted, or going on vacation. HRP ensures there is the best fit between workers and jobs, avoiding shortages and surpluses in the employee pool.

To satisfy their objectives, HR managers have to make plans to do the following:

Investing in HRP is one of the most important decisions a company can make. After all, a company is only as good as its employees, and a high level of <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/employee-engagement.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">employee engagement</a> can be essential for a company's success. If a company has the best employees and the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/best_practices.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">best practices</a> in place, it can mean the difference between sluggishness and productivity, helping to lead a company to profitability.

There are four general, broad steps involved in the human resource planning process. Each step needs to be taken in sequence in order to arrive at the end goal, which is to develop a strategy that enables the company to successfully find and retain enough qualified employees to meet the company's needs.

The first step of human resource planning is to identify the company's current human resources supply. In this step, the HR department studies the strength of the organization based on the number of employees, their skills, qualifications, positions, benefits, and performance levels.

The second step requires the company to outline the future of its workforce. Here, the HR department can consider certain issues like promotions, retirements, layoffs, and transfers—anything that factors into the future needs of a company. The HR department can also look at external conditions impacting <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/demand_for_labor.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">labor demand</a>, such as new technology that might increase or decrease the need for workers.

The third step in the HRP process is forecasting the employment demand. HR creates a gap analysis that lays out specific needs to narrow the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/013015/how-do-companies-measure-labor-supply-human-resources-planning.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">supply of the company's labor</a> versus future demand. This analysis will often generate a series of questions, such as:

The answers to questions from the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gap-analysis.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">gap analysis</a> help HR determine how to proceed, which is the final phase of the HRP process. HR must now take practical steps to integrate its plan with the rest of the company. The department needs a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/budget.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">budget</a>, the ability to implement the plan, and a collaborative effort with all departments to execute that plan.

The goal of HR planning is to have the optimal number of staff to make the most money for the company. Because the goals and strategies of a company change over time, human resource planning is a regular occurrence. Additionally, as <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/globalization.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">globalization</a> increases, HR departments will face the need to implement new practices to accommodate government labor regulations that vary from country to country.

The increased use of remote workers by many corporations will also impact human resource planning and will require HR departments to use new methods and tools to recruit, train, and retain workers.

Human resource planning (HRP) allows a business to better maintain and target the right kind of talent to employ - having the right technical and soft skills to optimize their function within the company. It also allows managers to better train and develop the skills needed amongst the workforce.

Hard HRP evaluates various quantitative metrics to ensure that the right number of the right sort of people are available when needed by the company. Soft HRP focuses more on finding employees with the right corporate culture, motivation, and attitude. Often these are used in tandem.

HRP begins with an analysis of the available labor pool from which they can draw from. It then evaluates the firm's present and future demand for various types of labor and attempts to match that demand with the supply of job applicants.
