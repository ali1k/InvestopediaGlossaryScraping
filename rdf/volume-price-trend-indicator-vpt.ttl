The volume price trend (VPT) indicator helps determine a security’s price direction and strength of price change. The indicator consists of a cumulative volume line that adds or subtracts a multiple of the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/percentage-change.asp">percentage change</a> in a share price’s trend and current volume, depending upon the security’s upward or downward movements.

The volume price trend indicator is used to determine the balance between a security’s demand and supply. The percentage change in the share price <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trend.asp">trend</a> shows the relative supply or demand of a particular security, while volume indicates the force behind the trend. The VPT indicator is similar to the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/onbalancevolume.asp">on-balance volume (OBV) indicator</a> in that it measures cumulative volume and provides traders with information about a security’s money flow. Most charting software packages have the VPT indicator included.

<em>Signal Line Crossovers:</em> A <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/signal_line.asp">signal line</a>, which is just a moving average of the indicator, can be applied and used to generate trading signals. For example, a trader may buy a stock when the VPT line crosses above its signal line and sell when the VPT line passes below its signal line.

<em>Confirmations: </em>The VPT indicator can be used in conjunction with moving averages and the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/adx.asp">average directional index (ADX)</a> to confirm trending markets. For instance, a trader could buy a stock if the 20-day moving average is above the 50-day moving average and accompanied by rising VPT indicator values. Conversely, the trader may decide to sell if the 20-day moving average is below the 50-day <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/movingaverage.asp">moving average</a> and the indicator’s values are falling.

The ADX also measures trend and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/momentum.asp">momentum</a> and can be used with the VPT indicator to confirm that a market is trending. ADX readings above 25 indicate that a security is trending, while readings below 25 indicate sideways price action. Therefore, a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trader.asp">trader</a> could buy when the ADX is above 25 and the VPT line is above its signal line. They could sell when the ADX has a value below 25 and the VPT line is below its signal line.

<em>Divergence:</em> Traders can use the VPT indicator to spot technical divergence. <a class="pseudoStyle" data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/052905.asp">Divergence</a> occurs when the indicator makes a higher high or a lower low, but the security’s price makes a lower high or a higher low. Traders should place a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stop-lossorder.asp">stop-loss order</a> above the most recent swing high or below the most recent swing low to minimize risk.
