    invp:description """
An audit committee is one of the major operating committees of a company's <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/boardoftrustees.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">board of directors</a> that is in charge of overseeing financial reporting and disclosure.

All U.S. publicly-traded companies must maintain a qualified <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/audit.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">audit</a> committee in order to be listed on a stock exchange. Committee members must be made up of <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/independent-outside-director.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">independent outside directors</a>, including a minimum of one person who qualifies as a financial expert.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿

The audit committee works closely with <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/auditor.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">auditors</a> to ensure that company's books are correct and that no conflicts of interest exist between auditors or any outside consulting firms employed by the company. Ideally, the chair of the audit committee will be a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cpa.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Certified Public Accountant (CPA)</a>. Often, however, a CPA is not available for the audit committee, let alone a member of the board of directors. The <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nyse.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)</a> requires that the audit committee include a financial expert, but this qualification is typically met by a retired banker, even though that person's ability to catch <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="4" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fraud.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">fraud</a> may be less than expert. The audit committee should meet at least four times a year in order to review the most recent audit, either in-person or via teleconferencing. An additional meeting should be held if other issues need to be addressed.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2">﻿</span>﻿

Audit committees maintain communication with the company's <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cfo.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">chief financial officer (CFO)</a> and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/controller.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">controller</a>. The committee has the authority to initiate special investigations in cases where it is determined that accounting practices are problematic or suspect, or when serious issues arise with employees. An <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/internalauditor.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">internal auditor</a> would assist the committee in such efforts.

The audit committee's role includes the oversight of financial reporting, the monitoring of <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accounting-policies.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">accounting policies</a>, the oversight of any external auditors, regulatory compliance and the discussion of <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskmanagement.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">risk management</a> policies with management. The duties and composition of a company's audit committee can be found in <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-def-14a.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">SEC Form DEF 14A</a>, or proxy statement.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿

Committee members may change from time to time, depending on the movement of personnel on or off the board or change of committee assignments. Aside from annual compensation for directors, those who serve on an audit committee (the same applies for all committees) are paid additionally for each meeting attended.

The audit committee must take its responsibilities very seriously. Financial reporting, compliance and risk management are subject to a number of hazards, especially when the company is a large organization with thousands of personnel and reporting systems stretching across the globe. Exogenous threats such as cyber hacking are under the purview of an audit committee, making its job even more challenging. <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cybersecurity.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cybersecurity</a> should be an increasing focus for audit committees in corporate boardrooms everywhere.
