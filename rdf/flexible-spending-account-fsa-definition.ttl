A flexible spending account (FSA) is a type of savings account that provides the account holder with specific tax advantages. An FSA, sometimes called a “flexible spending arrangement,” can be set up by an employer for employees. The account allows you to contribute a portion of your regular earnings; employers also can contribute to employees’ accounts. Distributions from the account must be used to reimburse the employee for qualified expenses related to medical and dental services.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿

Another type of FSA is a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dependent-care-fsa.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">dependent-care flexible spending account</a>, which is used to pay for childcare expenses for children age 12 and under and can also be used to pay for the care of qualifying adults,<br/>including a spouse, who cannot care for themselves and meet specific Internal Revenue Service (IRS) guidelines. A dependent-care FSA has different maximum contribution rules than a medical-related flexible spending account.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4">﻿</span>﻿

One of the key benefits of a flexible spending account is that the funds contributed to the account are deducted from your earnings before taxes, lowering your taxable income. As such, regular contributions to an FSA can reduce your annual tax liability.

The IRS limits how much can be contributed to an FSA account per year. For medical expense FSA accounts, the annual contribution limit per employee is $2,750 for each of 2020 and 2021. If you are married, your spouse can also put aside up to $2,750 through their employer. Employers can choose to contribute to an FSA, but they do not have to—if they do, their contribution does not reduce the amount that you are permitted to contribute. You are not taxed on employer contributions.

For 2020 and 2021, the contribution limit for a dependent-care FSA is $5,000 for joint and individual tax returns and $2,500 for married taxpayers filing separately.

The funds from an FSA can be used to reimburse payments for medical care, which is defined to include amounts paid for the diagnoses, cure, mitigation, treatment or prevention of disease, or for ailments affecting any structure of the body. However, expenses for surgery for cosmetic purposes and for items or services that are just beneficial for general health, such as vitamins, are not reimbursable. Qualified medical expenses for FSA owners, their spouses and dependents are covered.

Medical equipment purchases, such as diagnostic devices, bandages, and crutches, are covered by FSAs. Expenditures for prescription medications including over-the-counter (OTC) drugs for which you had a prescription, as well as insulin can be reimbursed with FSA funds. The <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/coronavirus-aid-relief-and-economic-security-cares-act-4800707" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act </a>enacted in 2020, expanded reimbursable qualified medical expenses for 2020 and later years to include the cost of over-the-counter drugs, without a doctor’s prescription. The act also permitted the use of FSA funds to reimburse the costs of menstrual care products. Both of these CARES provisions are permanent.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2">﻿</span>﻿

Funds in an FSA may also be used to reimburse amounts paid in accordance with insurance plan deductibles and co-payments for medical services. Unfortunately, the money may not be used to pay for insurance premiums.

All the money set aside in an FSA generally must be used by the end of the plan<br/>year. However, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/111314/how-does-grace-period-work-my-flexible-spending-account-fsa.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">a plan can offer a grace period</a> of up to two-and-a-half months to finish using that funding.

If that option is not taken, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/111615/does-money-flexible-spending-account-fsa-roll-over.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">a plan may allow you to roll over</a> up to $550 per year of unused funds from<br/>your account. Neither option is required, but only one may be offered by the plan.

When the year ends or the grace period expires, any funds that remain in your FSA are lost. Thus, you should carefully calibrate the amount of money you plan to put into your account and how you intend to spend it over the course of the year.

The Internal Revenue Service has announced that because of the impact of COVID-19, it will permit, but not require, employers to amend health plans so that employees can change elections that usually are allowed only once a year. Also, the IRS will allow employers discretion to amend FSA plans for 2020 and 2021 either to allow employees to carry over more than the current $550 maximum, or to extend the grace period for using unspent FSA funds through December 31 of each year.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5">﻿</span>﻿
