The kiddie tax is a special <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tax-code.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">tax law</a> created in 1986 to address investment and unearned <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incometax.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">income tax</a> for individuals under 19 years of age—or dependent full-time students under 23.

The kiddie tax is a tax imposed on individuals under a certain age (under 19 years old, and full-time students age 19-23 years old), whose investment and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unearnedincome.asp">unearned income</a> is higher than an annually determined threshold.

This rule is designed to prevent parents from exploiting a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/loophole.asp">tax loophole</a> where their children are given large gifts of stock. In this case, the child would then <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/realizedprofit.asp">realize any gains</a> from the investments and would be taxed at a far lower rate compared to the rate the guardians face for their realized stock gains.

Under the kiddie tax law, all unearned income over the threshold is taxed at the parent’s marginal income <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxrate.asp">tax rate</a> rather than the child’s tax rate. In 2020, unearned income under $1,100 qualifies for the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standarddeduction.asp">standard deduction</a>, the next $1,100 is taxed at the child’s tax rate, which is very low—sometimes zero percent—and then anything in excess of $2,200 is taxed at the guardian’s tax rate, which could be as high as 37%.

As of 2020, the kiddie tax applies to all children aged 19 and under, as well as children who are dependent <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fulltimestudent.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">full-time students</a> between the ages of 19 and 23. It does not apply, however, to children under these ages who are married and file <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jointreturn.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">joint tax returns</a>.

The kiddie tax includes unearned income a child receives: interest, dividends, capital gains, rent, and royalties. Any salary or wages the child earns is not subject to the kiddie tax.

The tax law originally only covered children under 14 years of age. Children under the age of 14 cannot legally work, which means that any income they received usually came from <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">dividends</a> or interest from <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">bonds</a>. However, the tax authorities realized that some guardians would take advantage of the situation, and then <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/07/giftofstock.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">give stock gifts</a> to their older, 16-to-18-year-old children.

The kiddie tax is a tax imposed on individuals under 19 years old whose investment and unearned income is higher than an annually determined threshold. The IRS taxes any income exceeding the predetermined threshold at the parent's tax rate. The <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/taxes/how-gop-tax-bill-affects-you/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017</a> temporarily changed the kiddie tax to use the tax rates that apply to estates and trusts rather than the tax rate of the child's parents.

However, the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act 2020 retroactively changed it back to the parent's tax rate. For 2018 and 2019 returns, taxpayers can choose to use either the estate tax rates or the parent's take rate for calculating the kiddie tax. For 2020 and beyond, the parent's tax rate applies.
