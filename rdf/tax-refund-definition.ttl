A tax refund is a reimbursement to a taxpayer of any excess amount paid to the federal government or a state government.

Taxpayers tend to look at a refund as a bonus or a stroke of luck, but it most often represents an interest-free loan that the taxpayer made to the government. In most cases, it is avoidable.

There are a number of reasons a taxpayer may get a refund of more than a trivial amount of money (or owe more than a trivial amount to the government):

The first two examples are easily avoided. That is, the money would have been paid to the taxpayer over the course of the year if the correct information had been on the W-4 form.

Of course, sometimes a tax refund is both unavoidable and welcome. For instance, a taxpayer who was laid off early in the year and was unable to get a new job immediately might receive a substantial refund based on his or her actual annual income.

Most tax credits are non-refundable. That is, a taxpayer who owes nothing forfeits the remaining tax credit. But there are exceptions.

Refundable tax credits include:

Tax refunds can be issued in the form of personal checks, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/ussavingsbonds.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">U.S. savings bonds</a>, or direct deposits to the taxpayer's bank account, among other options. Most are issued within a few weeks of the date the taxpayer initially files a return. However, there may be some instances where a refund takes longer.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿

If a taxpayer claims an earned income tax credit or <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/additional-child-tax-credit.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">additional child tax credit</a>, the refund will not be issued prior to a specific date, regardless of when the tax return is filed. For 2020 taxes, the IRS is estimating the first week of March for taxpayers claiming these refundable tax credits, if no other issues arise with the tax return and direct deposit is selected as the refund delivery method.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7">﻿</span>﻿

Refunds are always pleasant, but it would be better to avoid overpaying in the first place by claiming <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/081214/filling-out-your-w4-form.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">properly filling out your W-4 Form</a> or more precisely calculating your <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/estimated-tax.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">estimated taxes</a>. The closer you can get your refund to zero, the more money you will have throughout the prior year.

Not everyone agrees. Some people consider tax refunds an alternative savings plan and look forward to the lump-sum repayment.
