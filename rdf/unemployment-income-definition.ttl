The term unemployment income refers to an insurance benefit paid as a result of a taxpayer's inability to find gainful employment. Unemployment income is paid from either a federal or state-sponsored fund. The recipient must meet certain criteria in trying to find a job. Employers and employees are assessed a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/payrolltax.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">payroll tax</a> to cover the cost of this benefit.

Unemployment income is also known as an unemployment benefit, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unemployment-compensation.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">unemployment compensation</a>, or <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unemployment-insurance.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">unemployment insurance</a>. The term is most commonly associated with filing a tax return, where such income must be reported. 

Unemployment benefits were first introduced in 1935 along with <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/socialsecurity.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Social Security</a>.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2">﻿</span>﻿ Unemployment income is designed to provide subsistence income for a given length of time, giving the unemployed recipient time to find another job.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿

In the United States, unemployment income is paid to jobless individuals who qualify for them. Individuals must have worked at least one <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quarter.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">quarter</a> in the previous year and must have been laid off by their employer. They must be actively seeking work to claim and receive benefits. Temporary workers or those who worked off the books are not eligible, nor are individuals who quit their jobs or were fired for misconduct.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿

Claims may be denied for a number of reasons, including if:

Unemployment income is fully taxable as <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/ordinaryincome.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">ordinary income</a>. Recipients are sent a Form 1099-G at year-end detailing how much they received, which they must report on their <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/1040.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">1040 form</a>.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4">﻿</span>﻿

Individual states determine how much unemployment <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/income.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">income</a> an individual receives on a weekly basis, a figure that may vary significantly from state to state.

For example, as of 2018, Minnesota had one of the highest maximum weekly benefit amounts at $683, topped only by Massachusetts at $742 (+$25 per child). Massachusetts allows up to 30 weeks of payments; Minnesota offers 26. Though not the lowest, Florida's $275 maximum weekly benefit and 12 weeks of benefits is among the least generous. 

During times of high unemployment, such as during the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/great-recession.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Great Recession</a>, unemployment income payments may last for over 100 weeks. During times of low unemployment, such benefits tend to last for up to roughly six months or 26 weeks in most states, though some states may offer a fraction of that.

On March 27, 2020, President Donald Trump signed into law a $2 trillion coronavirus emergency stimulus package called the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/coronavirus-aid-relief-and-economic-security-cares-act-4800707" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act</a>, which put provisions in place to provide unemployment benefits to unemployed individuals affected by the pandemic.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5">﻿</span>﻿

The law also expanded eligibility to allow those who otherwise don't qualify for benefits, including self-employed people, freelancers, and independent contractors, and created three initiatives called the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/pandemic-unemployment-assistance-pua-definition-4802064" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pandemic Unemployment Assistance</a> (PUA) program, the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/federal-pandemic-unemployment-compensation-fpuc-definition-4802039" rel="noopener noreferrer">Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation</a> (FPUC) program, and the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/pandemic-emergency-unemployment-compensation-peuc-definition-4802046" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation</a> (PEUC) program.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5">﻿</span>﻿

As mentioned above, unemployment benefits were expanded under the PUA to include people who normally don't qualify for this type of income. These benefits are based on someone's previous earnings, according to a formula Disaster Unemployment Assistance program.

The minimum benefit provided is 50% of an individual state's average benefit per week, which is approximately $190 for that period.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5">﻿</span>﻿

The CARES Act also established the FPUC program, which provided unemployed individuals with an extra benefit of $600. This benefit was paid weekly in addition to other unemployment income until July 2020.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5">﻿</span>﻿

The Trump administration extended this benefit after passing the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/congress-agrees-on-second-stimulus-here-s-what-s-in-it-and-what-s-not-5093226" rel="noopener noreferrer">Consolidated Appropriations Act</a> (CAA) of 2021 in December 2020. But the amount was reduced down to $300, payable every week beginning Dec. 26, 2020, until March 14, 2021.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6">﻿</span>﻿

President Joe Biden pushed down the expiry date after he signed the $1.9 trillion package called the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/american-rescue-plan-definition-5095694" rel="noopener noreferrer">American Rescue Plan Act</a> of 2021 on March 11, 2021. According to the new law, unemployed individuals can receive the additional $300 weekly benefit until Sept. 6, 2021.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7">﻿</span>﻿

States normally provide people with 26 weeks of unemployment benefits. But the CARES Act expanded that timeline under the PEUC, allowing individuals to claim benefits for an additional 13 weeks. But the law stated that people were must be "able to work, available to work, and actively seeking work."<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5">﻿</span>﻿

This was extended to 24 weeks with the passage of the CAA in December 2020.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6">﻿</span>﻿ The Biden Administration changed that again in March 2021 to 53 weeks, meaning the PEUC is set to expire on Sept. 6, 2021.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7">﻿</span>﻿
