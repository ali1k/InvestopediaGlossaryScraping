The Group of 30, generally abbreviated to G-30, is a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/privately-owned.asp">private</a>, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/non-profitorganization.asp">nonprofit</a> international body composed of academic <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economist.asp">economists</a>, company chiefs, and representatives of national, regional, and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="4" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/centralbank.asp">central banks</a>. G-30 members meet twice a year to generate a greater understanding of financial and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="5" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economics.asp">economic</a> issues in the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="6" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/private-sector.asp">private</a> and public sectors worldwide.

The G-30 claims its mission is to deepen understanding of international economic and financial issues, and to explore the international repercussions of decisions taken in the public and private sectors." It sets out to achieve this by meeting<strong><em> </em></strong>twice yearly in Washington, D.C. Topics that often come up include <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreign-exchange.asp">foreign exchange</a>, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalmarkets.asp">capital markets</a>, central banks, and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/macroeconomics.asp">macroeconomic</a> issues, such as global production and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="4" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/labor-market.asp">labor</a>.

The events hosted by the G-30 are invitation-only, meaning that regular members of the public are not able to attend them. However, the group has made it possible to download its publications and research for free from its website.

Often, the G-30 reports generate little interest from the public, due to their technical nature. That said, some of its findings have had a major impact, including a paper it released on <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/optioninvestor/10/derivatives-101.asp">derivatives</a>.

At the time, many people were skeptical of derivatives, citing a lack of understanding and the complexity of financial <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp">securities</a>,<strong> </strong>such as <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forwardcontract.asp">forwards</a>, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futurescontract.asp">futures</a>, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="4" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option.asp">options</a>, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="5" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/swap.asp">swaps</a>, and other similar market contracts that derive their value from an <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="6" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underlying-asset.asp">underlying asset</a>.

The G-30 was founded in 1978 by Geoffrey Bell, under directive and initial funding from the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/08/jd-rockefeller.asp">Rockefeller</a> Foundation. Prior to the existence of the G-30, similar aims in understanding economic issues and crises was sought by an organization called the Bellagio Group.

The Bellagio Group, formed by Austrian economist Fritz Machlup, first met in the early 1960s to address international <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currency.asp">currency</a> issues and the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bop.asp">balance of payments</a> (BOP) crisis facing the United States at that time.

The G-30's first <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/chairman.asp">chairman</a> was Johannes Witteveen, the former managing director of the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/imf.asp">International Monetary Fund</a> (IMF). As of 2019, the current chairman of the G-30 is Tharman Shanmugaratnam, a Singaporean economist and politician. Shanmugaratnam is the first Asian person to hold the post, which has a five-year term.

The international body's present and alumni members list reads like a who's who of international finance. Members come from all over the world and are known for holding leadership positions in the public and private sectors. The majority of participants formerly held senior positions in central banking, while many still do.

Current members include Jacob Frenkel, chairman of JPMorgan Chase International; Paul Volcker, the former chairman of the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalreservesystem.asp">Federal Reserve System</a> (FRS); Jean-Claude Trichet, a former president of the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/europeancentralbank.asp">European Central Bank</a> (ECB); Mark Carney, governor of the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/boe.asp">Bank of England</a> (BoE); and William Dudley, a senior research scholar for economic policy studies at Princeton University, who until 2018 was the president of the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="4" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federal-reserve-bank-of-new-york.asp">Federal Reserve Bank of New York</a>.
