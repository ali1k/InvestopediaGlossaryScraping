Terms of employment refer to the responsibilities and benefits associated with a job as agreed upon by an employer and employee at the time of hiring. These terms, which may also be referred to as conditions of employment, generally include job responsibilities, work hours, dress code, time off the job, and starting salary. They may also include benefits such as <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/healthinsurance.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">health insurance</a>, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lifeinsurance.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">life insurance</a>, and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/retirement/best-retirement-plans-companies/" rel="noopener noreferrer">retirement plans</a>.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7">﻿</span>﻿

Although terms of employment may be agreed upon verbally, employees and employers normally sign written contracts.

Most employers require professional and administrative employees, as well as <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/03/022803.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">executives</a> to sign a written employment agreement or contract that details the terms of employment. The conditions of employment for hourly employees are often outlined in an employee handbook or company policy manual. In certain circumstances, terms may also be expressed verbally. Written terms, though, can protect both the employee and the employer.

In addition to the nuts and bolts of salary and benefits, terms of employment can specify touchy issues such as dispute resolution, nondisclosure or <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/noncompete-agreement.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">non-compete agreements</a>, and grounds for termination, as well as the possibility of a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/notice-of-termination.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">notice of termination</a>.

Job seekers with skills in high demand are often able to <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/negotiation.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">negotiate</a> better terms of employment. Executive-level jobs also include negotiations over the terms between hiring managers and candidates. Whether it's an executive position or an <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financialcareers/11/beginner-careers-in-finance.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">entry-level job</a>, terms of employment are subject to state or federal guidelines.

Minimum standards for <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/120914/8-federal-laws-protect-employees.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">terms of employment</a> in the U.S. are set by the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dol.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Department of Labor</a> (DOL). They include rules covering the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/minimum_wage.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">minimum wage</a>, overtime, the standard workweek, mandated break times, and safety issues.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2">﻿</span>﻿ The department also governs employment laws in certain industries, such as agriculture, mining, and construction.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8">﻿</span>﻿ State laws may add additional benefits, rules, or rights regarding employment within their jurisdictions.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9">﻿</span>﻿

Employment contracts are normally considered at-will in the United States.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿ This means that either the employer or employee can legally terminate the agreement at any time for almost any reason. At-will employment allows an employee to be fired even if no terms of employment have been violated. <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/120914/8-federal-laws-protect-employees.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Employment laws</a> protect workers from discrimination due to race, gender, or religion.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿

In practice, employees with contracts generally have a degree of job security for the length of the contract as long as they do not violate any contract conditions. At-will laws don't apply in Montana—the only state of its kind—so employees can only be terminated for good reason.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10">﻿</span>﻿

The at-will rule also doesn't apply to individuals who are part of <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/labor-union.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">labor unions</a>. These organizations help protect workers' rights by negotiating benefits and other employment conditions, including terms of termination. Employees who work under unions have set contracts and can't be terminated at-will thanks to <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/collective-bargaining.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">collective bargaining</a> agreements.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11">﻿</span>﻿

Most developed and developing countries have codified certain standard terms of employment. Ireland has its Terms of Employment (Information) Act which outlines rules covering a variety of workplace and labor topics.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿ Australia's <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" href="https://www.fairwork.gov.au/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Fair Work Ombudsman</a> sets rules related to pay, leave, redundancy, entitlements, and more.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4">﻿</span>﻿

U.S. labor laws are not generous compared to those in other parts of the world. The European Union, for example, mandates that workers get at least four weeks of vacation every year.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5">﻿</span>﻿ In Finland, expectant mothers get paid leave at least six weeks before their due date, and 15 more weeks after the birth of a child.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6">﻿</span>﻿ <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/09/deciphering-benefits-at-new-job.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Benefits</a> like these may not be included in your next terms of employment, no matter how hard you bargain.
