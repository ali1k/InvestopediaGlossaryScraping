The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) is the former name of a Malaysian <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/04/092404.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">stock exchange</a> located in the capital city of Kuala Lumpur. The KLSE dates back to 1930 and was specifically created to allow the trading of Malaysian <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">securities</a>. The exchange went through several name changes over the years but is now known as Bursa Malaysia.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿

KLSE is one of the largest exchanges in the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asean.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Association of Southeast Asian Nations</a> (ASEAN), allowing traders to trade equities, exchange traded funds (ETFs), offshore Islamic assets, and other securities.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7">﻿</span>﻿

As noted above, the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange is now known as Bursa Malaysia. The exchange is fully integrated and offers <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/clearing.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">clearing</a>, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/trading-4427765" rel="noopener noreferrer">trading</a>, listing, depository, and settlement services.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8">﻿</span>﻿ It has a fully automated trading system which launched in late 2008.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿

According to the exchange's website, 900 companies are able to use it to raise <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">capital</a> through a number of different economic activities.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7">﻿</span>﻿ Its main index is the Kuala Lumpur Composite Index (KLCI), now known as FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI, which is composed of the top 30 companies on the Bursa Malaysia Exchange.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿

A number of different financial securities trade on Bursa Malaysia, including equities, bonds, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/derivative.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">derivatives</a>, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exchange-traded-products-etp.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">exchange-traded products</a> (ETPs), and real estate investment trusts (REITs). There's also an Islamic market team that promotes Shariah-compliant capital markets to cater to the nation's Muslim majority.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10">﻿</span>﻿ This market includes domestic and offshore Islamic assets as well as <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/islamicbanking.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Islamic banking</a>, the Shari'ah-compliant trading platform that was launched in 2009.

Companies that want to list on the exchange have three options available including the main or prime market for large, established <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corporation.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">corporations</a>, as well as the ACE market for companies that have the potential for growth.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11">﻿</span>﻿ The final option is known as the LEAP market, which is meant for up-and-coming small- and mid-sized companies.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11">﻿</span>﻿

Bursa Malaysia also works with other global corporations and exchanges to promote performance and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/transparency.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">transparency</a> in global capital markets. For instance, it entered into a partnership with the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cme.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chicago Mercantile Exchange</a> (CME) to offer derivatives.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9">﻿</span>﻿ This agreement is valid until 2025.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9">﻿</span>﻿

Traders are only able to <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">short-sell</a> equity-based <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">exchange traded funds</a>, but that may change in the future. In July 2018, Bursa Malaysia released a consultation paper that sought public comment on a proposed amendment related to ETFs.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2">﻿</span>﻿ This call comes after a task force on ETFs, which included the Securities Commission Malaysia (SC), Bursa Malaysia, and other <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">market</a> participants made recommendations aimed at expanding investor interest in ETFs. Recommendations from the task force urged including ETFs, such as:

In service of these goals, the rule changes would loosen regulations on the short-selling framework to allow various short-selling types of ETF units.

The exchange dates back to 1930, when it was established as the Singapore Stockbrokers' Association. This was the first securities business developed in the Southeast Asian nation.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿ It went through a series of name changes including the Malayan Stock Exchange and the Stock Exchange of Malaysia.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿ Securities trading to the public began in 1960 and the exchange was <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incorporate.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">incorporated</a> as a company in 1976.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿

In a move to become more customer-focused, the exchange <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/demutualization.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">demutualized</a> in 2004.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿ With demutualization, a business that has member ownership converts into one that has <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholder.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">shareholders</a>. With this change in ownership structure, the name changed to Bursa Malaysia.
