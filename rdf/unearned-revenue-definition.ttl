Unearned revenue is money received by an individual or company for a service or product that has yet to be provided or delivered. It can be thought of as a "prepayment" for goods or services that a person or company is expected to supply to the purchaser at a later date. As a result of this prepayment, the seller has a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liability.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">liability</a> equal to the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/revenue.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">revenue</a> earned until the good or service is delivered. This liability is noted under current liabilities, as it is expected to be settled within a year.

Unearned revenue is also referred to as <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deferredrevenue.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">deferred revenue</a> and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/advance-payment.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">advance payments</a>.

Unearned revenue is most common among companies selling subscription-based products or other services that require prepayments. Classic examples include rent payments made in advance, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/prepaid-insurance.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">prepaid insurance</a>, legal retainers, airline tickets, prepayment for newspaper subscriptions, and annual prepayment for the use of software.

Receiving money before a service is fulfilled can be beneficial. The early receipt of <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashflow.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">cash flow</a> can be used for any number of activities, such as paying <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestexpense.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">interest</a> on debt and purchasing more <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inventory.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">inventory</a>. 

Unearned revenue is recorded on a company’s <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancesheet.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">balance sheet</a> as a liability. It is treated as a liability because the revenue has still not been earned and represents products or services owed to a customer. As the prepaid service or product is gradually delivered over time, it is recognized as revenue on the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incomestatement.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">income statement</a>. 

If a publishing company accepts $1,200 for a one-year subscription, the amount is recorded as an increase in cash and an increase in unearned revenue. Both are balance sheet accounts, so the transaction does not immediately affect the income statement. If it is a monthly publication, as each periodical is delivered, the liability or unearned revenue is reduced by $100 ($1,200 divided by 12 months) while revenue is increased by the same amount.

Unearned revenue is usually disclosed as a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentliabilities.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">current liability</a> on a company’s balance sheet. This changes if advance payments are made for services or goods due to be provided 12 months or more after the payment date. In such cases, the unearned revenue will appear as a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/longtermliabilities.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">long-term liability</a> on the balance sheet.

There are several criteria established by the U.S. <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) that a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/publiccompany.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">public company</a> must meet to recognize revenue. If these are not met, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/revenuerecognition.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">revenue recognition</a> is deferred.

According to the SEC, there must be collection probability, or the ability to make a reasonable estimate of an amount for the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/allowancefordoubtfulaccounts.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">allowance for doubtful accounts</a>, completed delivery, or ownership shifted to the buyer, persuasive evidence of an arrangement, and a determined price.

Morningstar Inc. (<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=morn" rel="noopener noreferrer">MORN</a>) offers a line of products and services for the financial industry, including <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-advisor.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">financial advisors</a> and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetmanagement.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">asset managers</a>. Many of its products are sold through subscriptions. Under this arrangement, many subscribers pay upfront and receive the product over time. This creates a situation in which the amount is recorded as unearned revenue or, as Morningstar calls it, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="4" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deferredrevenue.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">deferred revenue</a>.

At the end of the second quarter of 2020, Morningstar had $287 million in unearned revenue, up from $250 million from the prior-year end. The company classifies the revenue as a short-term liability, meaning it expects the amount to be paid over one year for services to be provided over the same period.

Unearned revenue can provide clues into future revenue, although investors should note the balance change could be due to a change in the business. Morningstar increased quarterly and monthly <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/invoice.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">invoices</a> but is less reliant on up-front payments from annual invoices, meaning the balance has been growing more slowly than in the past.
