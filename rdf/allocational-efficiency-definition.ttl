Allocational efficiency, also known as allocative efficiency, is a characteristic of an <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketefficiency.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">efficient market</a> where capital is assigned in a way that is most beneficial to the parties involved.

Allocational efficiency represents an optimal distribution of goods and services to consumers in an <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economy.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">economy</a>, as well as an optimal distribution of financial <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">capital</a> to firms or projects among investors. Under allocational efficiency, all goods, services, and capital is allotted and distributed to its very best use.

Allocational efficiency occurs when organizations in the public and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/private-sector.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">private sectors</a> spend their resources on projects that will be the most profitable and do the most good for the population, thereby promoting <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economicgrowth.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">economic growth</a>. This is made possible when parties are able to use the accurate and readily available data reflected in the market to make decisions about how to utilize their resources.

When all of the data affecting a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">market</a> is accessible, companies can make accurate decisions about what projects might be most profitable and manufacturers can concentrate on producing products that are most desired by the general population.

In economics, allocative efficiency materializes at the intersection of the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/law-of-supply-demand.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">supply and demand</a> curves. At this <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equilibrium.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">equilibrium</a> point, the price offered for a given supply exactly matches the demand for that supply at that price, and so all products are sold.

In order to be allocationally efficient, a market must be efficient overall. An efficient market is one in which all pertinent data regarding the market and its activities is readily available to all market participants and is always reflected in <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market-price.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">market prices</a>.

For the market to be efficient, it must meet the prerequisites of being both <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strongform.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">informationally efficient</a> and transactionally or <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operationalefficiency.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">operationally efficient</a>. When a market is informationally efficient, all necessary and pertinent information about the market is readily available to all parties involved in the market. In other words, no parties have an informational advantage over any other parties.

Meanwhile, when a market is transactionally efficient, all <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/transactioncosts.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">transaction costs</a> are reasonable and fair. This ensures that all transactions are equally executable by all parties and not prohibitively expensive to anyone.

If these conditions of fairness are met and the market is efficient, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital-flows.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">capital flows</a> will direct themselves to the places where they will be the most effective, providing an optimal risk/reward scenario for investors.
