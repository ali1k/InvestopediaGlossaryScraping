Form 1310 is an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) form that should be used to claim a federal tax refund due to a recently deceased taxpayer.

In general, a surviving spouse or the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/executor.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">executor</a> of an <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/estate.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">estate</a> files <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irs.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">IRS</a> Form 1310. To become the executor, an individual must be named in the deceased’s will. In the absence of a will, a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="4" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/probate-court.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">probate court</a> will name an individual to handle the executor’s duties. This person is known as a personal representative or administrator.

Probate courts vary from state to state, but they generally consider a hierarchy of candidates to serve as personal representative. This list begins with a spouse and other close relatives and continues to include more distant relatives and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditor.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">creditors</a>.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿

If the executor or personal representative is filing a full tax return on behalf of the deceased individual, they must submit <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/1040.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Form 1040</a> along with Form 1310 directing the IRS to pay a refund. The executor may also need to file taxes owed by the estate rather than the individual. In this case, the representative will be required to file a Form 1041 along with a 1310 form. The 1041 form would be required only if the estate generates more than $600 in income per year.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6">﻿</span>﻿

If filing a Form 1310 along with a Form 1041, the executor must be aware that the IRS will issue the refund to the estate rather than to any individual. Executors should always request a physical check rather than an electronic refund because most banks will not send money to a differently titled account without special authorization.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿

Form 1310 asks a series of identifying questions and requests legal documentation of the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/filingstatus.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">taxpayer’s status</a> and executor's appointment. First, it asks the filer of the form to explain their role and justification for requesting the refund.

A surviving spouse need not submit a death certificate if they are requesting a refund check made out to both spouses. This is because a refund check would have referenced both taxpayers' names prior to the spouse’s death.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4">﻿</span>﻿

A personal representative must submit their court certificate in order to request a refund. In the absence of a court appointment, the filing individual must submit a copy of the death certificate and answer questions on Form 1310.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4">﻿</span>﻿

All pages of Form 1310 are available on the IRS website.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9">﻿</span>﻿
