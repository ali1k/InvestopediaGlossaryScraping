The term ghetto refers to an urban area with low <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/realestate/12/real-estate-valuation.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">property values</a> and relatively little public or private investment. The word is slang and is generally considered an offensive stereotype because ghettos have historically been inhabited by racial minorities. Ghettos are also characterized by high <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unemployment.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">unemployment</a>, high rates of crime, inadequate municipal services, and high drop-out rates from schools. Urban neighborhoods classified as ghettos may be severely underpopulated with abandoned homes, or they may be densely populated with large families living in small spaces.

The word ghetto is a derogatory term used to describe certain communities in large urban centers. As mentioned above, these areas are characterized by a lack of resources, little development, and a high concentration of racial minorities, among others. <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/realestate.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Real estate</a> values in these communities are generally much lower than in other parts of the same city, as properties tend to be outdated, run down, and/or <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/abandoned-property.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">abandoned</a>.

Areas that are considered ghettos in the United States statistically tend to be racially segregated.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿ This reflects a history of segregation in the country as well as a history of inequality in terms of access to <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wealth.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">wealth</a>, property rights, and other resources. As such, many of these neighborhoods lack adequate resources, good schools, and may even be heavily policed. Literacy and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/poverty.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">poverty</a> rates tend to be fairly high while the level of education in many underdeveloped neighborhoods remains low when compared to other areas of large urban centers.

Areas of extreme poverty are defined by the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bureauofcensus.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">U.S. Census</a> as neighborhoods where 40% or more of the population earn low incomes.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2">﻿</span>﻿ Some people identify these neighborhoods by physical characteristics, such as large numbers of poorly maintained buildings, unkempt lots, and trash or debris accumulated in the street or on properties.

Many neighborhoods that were once considered ghettos have been transformed through urban renewal policies, shifting racial demographics, or <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gentrification.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">gentrification</a>.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿ Large investments come to these areas because of local or state policy, generally from private entities. Governments create policies to entice real estate developers to purchase multiple properties in considerably poor areas. These companies often build new homes and commercial spaces in these neighborhoods. Incentives for the developers generally include <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tax-break.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">tax breaks</a> and loose <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/z/zoning.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">zoning</a> laws.

Neighborhoods may be transformed very quickly, with new residents moving into new spaces. New residents tend to come from different ethnic groups than the previous minority inhabitants and to have significantly higher <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/income.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">incomes</a>. Urban renewal as a policy has been <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/07/upshot/why-trumps-use-of-the-words-urban-renewal-is-scary-for-cities.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">controversial</a> for its effect of displacing minority and low-income residents who generally struggle to find <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/mortgages-real-estate/10/affordable-housing.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">affordable housing</a> in a market with increasingly high property values.

The term ghetto comes from 13th century Europe when cities in Spain, Germany, Italy, and Portugal sought to segregate Jewish populations into one area upon the suggestion of Pope Pius V. The word itself may come from several sources. Jews settled into an area of an old iron foundry, or ghetto, in Venice, Italy, in the 14th century.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4">﻿</span>﻿ The term also has roots in the Greek word "ghetonia," which means "neighborhood," or the Italian "borghetto," which means "small neighborhood."

Jim Crow laws and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/income-inequality.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">income inequality</a> contributed to the creation of many low-income, minority neighborhoods in the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/080116/americas-poorest-states-2016.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">United States</a>.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5">﻿</span>﻿ Some were formed after the Civil War, while others were created in the late 20th century. Residents in these neighborhoods are also subject to predatory financial practices, such as mortgage lending discrimination and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/redlining.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">redlining</a>. Some of these areas have since changed—mainly because of gentrification—while others remain overwhelmingly poor.
