The crowding out effect is an economic theory arguing that rising public sector spending drives down or even eliminates <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/private-sector.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">private sector</a> spending.

One of the most common forms of crowding out takes place when a large government, such as that of the U.S., increases its borrowing and sets in motion a chain of events that results in the curtailing of private sector spending. The sheer scale of this type of borrowing can lead to substantial rises in the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/realinterestrate.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">real interest rate</a>, which has the effect of absorbing the economy's lending capacity and of discouraging businesses from making <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital-investment.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">capital investments</a>.

Companies often fund such projects in part or entirely through <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financing.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">financing</a>, and are now discouraged from doing so because the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/opportunitycost.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">opportunity cost</a> of borrowing money has risen, making traditionally profitable projects funded through loans cost-prohibitive.

The crowding out effect has been discussed for over a hundred years in various forms. During much of this time, people thought of capital as being finite and confined to individual countries, which was largely the case due to lower volumes of <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/insights/what-is-international-trade/" rel="noopener noreferrer">international trade</a> compared to the present day. In that context, increased <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxation.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">taxation</a> for public works projects and public spending could be directly linked to a reduction in the capacity for private spending within a given country, as less money was available.

On the other hand, macroeconomic theories such as <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/chartalism.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chartalism</a> and Post-Keynesian posit that government borrowing, in a modern economy operating significantly below <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capacity.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">capacity</a>, can actually increase demand by generating employment, thereby stimulating private spending as well. This process is often referred to as "crowding in."

The crowding in theory has gained some currency among economists in recent years after it was noted that, during the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/great-recession.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Great Recession</a> of 2007–2009, massive spending on the part of the federal government on <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">bonds</a> and other securities actually had the effect of reducing interest rates.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿﻿﻿

Reductions in capital spending can partially offset benefits brought about through government borrowing, such as those of <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economic-stimulus.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">economic stimulus</a>, though this is only likely when the economy is operating at capacity. In this respect, government stimulus is theoretically more effective when the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economy.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">economy</a> is below capacity.

If this is the case, however, an economic downswing may occur, reducing revenues the government collects through taxes and spurring it to borrow even more money, which can theoretically lead to a vicious cycle of borrowing and crowding out.

Crowding out may also take place because of <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/social-welfare-system.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">social welfare</a>, albeit indirectly. When governments raise taxes in order to introduce or expand welfare programs, individuals and businesses are left with less <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/discretionaryincome.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">discretionary income</a>, which can reduce charitable contributions. In this respect, public sector expenditures for social welfare can reduce private-sector giving for social welfare, offsetting the government's spending on those same causes.

Similarly, the creation or expansion of public <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/healthinsurance.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">health insurance</a> programs such as Medicaid can prompt those covered by private insurance to switch to the public option. Left with fewer customers and a smaller risk pool, private health insurance companies may have to raise <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurance-premium.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">premiums</a>, leading to further reductions in private coverage.

Another form of crowding out can occur because of government-funded <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/infrastructure.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">infrastructure</a> development projects, which can discourage private enterprise from taking place in the same area of the market by making it undesirable or even unprofitable. This often occurs with bridges and other roads, as government-funded development deters companies from building toll roads or from engaging in other similar projects.

Suppose a firm has been planning a capital project, with an estimated cost of $5 million and a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/return.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">return</a> of $6 million, assuming the interest rate on its loans is 3%. The firm anticipates earning $1 million in <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/netincome.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">net income</a> (NI). Due to the shaky state of the economy, however, the government announces a stimulus package that will help businesses in need but will also raise the interest rate on the firm's new loans to 4%.

Because the interest rate the firm had factored into its accounting has increased by 33.3%, its profit model shifts wildly and the firm estimates that it will now need to spend $5.75 million on the project in order to make the same $6 million in returns. Its projected earnings have now dropped by 75% to $250,000, so the company decides that it would be better off pursuing other options.
