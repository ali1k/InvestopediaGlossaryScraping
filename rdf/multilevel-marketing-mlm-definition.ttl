Multilevel marketing (MLM) is a strategy some direct <a class="CMY_Link CMY_Valid" data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sale.asp">sales</a> companies use to encourage existing distributors to recruit new distributors who are paid a percentage of their recruits' sales. The recruits are the distributor's "downline." Distributors also make money through direct sales of products to customers. Amway, which sells health, beauty, and home care products, is an example of a well-known direct sales company that uses multilevel marketing.

Multilevel marketing is a legitimate business strategy, though it is controversial. One problem is pyramid schemes that use money from new recruits to pay people at the top rather than those who perform the work. These schemes involve taking advantage of people by pretending to be engaged in legitimate multilevel or <a class="CMY_Link CMY_Valid" data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/network-marketing.asp">network marketing</a>. You can spot pyramid schemes by their greater focus on recruitment than on product sales.

An issue in determining the legitimacy of a multilevel marketing company is whether it sells its products primarily to consumers or to its members who must recruit new members to buy their products. If it is the former, the company is likely a legitimate multilevel marketer. If it is the latter, it could be an illegal pyramid scheme.

The <a class="CMY_Link CMY_Valid" data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/ftc.asp">Federal Trade Commission</a> (FTC) has been investigating multilevel marketing companies for several decades and has found many with practices that are difficult to determine as legitimate. According to the <a class="CMY_Link CMY_Valid" data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" href="https://wfdsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Sales-Report-2017-June-12-2018.pdf" rel="nofollow">World Federation of Direct Selling Associates</a>, there were at least 116 million independent representatives among its members worldwide as of 2017. Relatively few earn meaningful incomes from their efforts. To some observers, this reflects the characteristics of a pyramid scheme.

Herbalife Nutrition Ltd. is a high-profile, multilevel marketing company that manufactures and distributes weight-loss and nutritional products, with more than 500,000 distributors. Although the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2016/07/herbalife-will-restructure-its-multi-level-marketing-operations">FTC has investigated Herbalife</a>, it was activist investor William Ackman, who shed a national spotlight on the company by shorting $1 billion of the company’s stock in 2012. Ackman accused the company of operating a pyramid scheme and backed his allegations with a bet the company’s stock price would fall under the weight of the scam.

In 2018, Ackman gave up on his bet. As of Oct. 27, 2019, the company’s stock price traded at $40 a share.

There have been multiple lawsuits against <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" href="https://company.herbalife.com/" rel="nofollow">Herbalife</a>, accusing it of misrepresenting its sales practices. This included a settlement it reached with the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2016/07/herbalife-will-restructure-its-multi-level-marketing-operations">FTC in 2016,</a> under which it had to restructure its business. Herbalife argues that most of its revenue is from product sales, not recruitment, and it offers members many protections, such as a money-back guarantee, so they will not be stuck with products they could not sell.

Broadly speaking, multilevel marketing is a sales structure where members of a company are encouraged to recruit new members. After recruiting a new member, this salesperson will receive a cut of their recruiters sale. At the same time, each salesperson will profit from the sale of a given product.

Regularly faced with controversy, multilevel marketing is often compared to pyramid schemes. While some multilevel marketing operations are legal, others have come under investigation. Typically, this will occur when the majority of the operation’s profits funnell up to the top, leaving little for the rest of its members. When an organization focuses primarily on recruitment, rather than selling products, this too may signal that it is operating under a pyramid scheme. Sometimes, members of these schemes will number in the hundreds or even thousands. 

One example of multilevel marketing is Avon. The company operates under a model where sales are driven through a network of salespeople, through presentations or one-on-one settings in homes or businesses. Like a number of other multilevel marketing businesses, Avon typically does not operate a fixed retail location. The parent company, instead, provides the tools and resources to entrepreneurs to conduct their business at various locations. This type of business model is also referred to as a direct sales model.
