In finance, the acronym "FANG" refers to the stocks of four prominent American <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technology_sector.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">technology companies</a>: Facebook (<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=FB" rel="noopener noreferrer">FB</a>), Amazon (<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=AMZN" rel="noopener noreferrer">AMZN</a>), Netflix (<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="4" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=NFLX" rel="noopener noreferrer">NFLX</a>), and Alphabet (<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="5" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=GOOG" rel="noopener noreferrer">GOOG</a>). In 2017, the company Apple (<a data-component="link" data-ordinal="6" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=AAPL" rel="noopener noreferrer">AAPL</a>) was also added, causing the acronym to be rewritten as "FAANG."

FANG stocks are famous for the impressive growth they have shown in recent years, with each member more than doubling over the past five years.

The term FANG Stocks was coined by CNBC's "Mad Money" host <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jimcramer.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jim Cramer</a> in 2013.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿ It is now widely used by market commentators and analysts. The stocks referred to by the acronym are all well-known and richly-valued technology companies that trade on the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nasdaq.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">NASDAQ</a> exchange, a collection of approximately 3,300 American technology companies.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2">﻿</span>﻿ Many other companies included in the NASDAQ exchange are also viewed as <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/growthinvesting.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">growth investments</a>, although very few have matched the impressive growth of the FANG stocks in recent years.

Despite their common reputation as successful growth companies, the business models of the FANG stocks are distinct. Facebook, for example, is the world’s preeminent <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/social-networking.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">social networking</a> platform. With a user-base of more than 2.5 billion people as of Aug. 2020, the company can claim approximately 30% of the world's population as its customers.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿ To monetize this extraordinary user base, Facebook sells ads that are targeted based on users’ personal preferences and usage patterns.

Amazon, meanwhile, is a leading <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/btoc.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">business to consumer (B2C)</a> e-commerce platform that uses leading-edge <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cloud-computing.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">cloud computing</a> and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/data-analytics.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">data analytics</a> technologies to sell a retail catalog. Although Amazon initially pioneered the sale of books online, books now represent only about one-third of their overall product catalog. In 2020, the company had sold products to over 300 million active customers in the U.S. alone, with half of those customers opting to subscribe to its paid membership service, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="4" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/personal-finance/8-lesser-known-benefits-amazon-prime/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon Prime</a>.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4">﻿</span>﻿

Netflix is also known for its impressive customer growth. An online entertainment <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/the-streaming-tv-wars-are-heating-up-fast-4771386" rel="noopener noreferrer">streaming service</a> specializing in movies and television shows, the company's subscriber base has grown exponentially in recent years, from 22 million in 2011 to more than 190 million in 2020.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5">﻿</span>﻿ To compete with <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/barrierstoentry.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">new entrants</a> to the streaming market, Netflix has also begun aggressively producing its own exclusive content, moving beyond its traditional role as a content aggregator to a major content producer in its own right.

Alphabet has leveraged its core expertise as the world’s foremost search engine, developing a highly profitable online advertising business while driving user retention through popular web applications such as YouTube, Google Docs, and Google Maps. The company receives an average of over 60,000 search requests every second of every day, and its mobile operating system, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/android-operating-system.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Android</a>, has gained an estimated 75% share of the global <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smartphone.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">smartphone market</a>.

With these impressive facts in mind, it is no wonder why investors have been enthusiastic about the FANG Stocks' business prospects. In recent years, this enthusiasm has been supported by the companies' financial performance, which has caused substantial increases in their respective stock prices.

In the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/ttm.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">trailing twelve months (TTM)</a> as of August 2020, for example, Facebook has reported <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/revenue.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">revenues</a> of over $75 billion, and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/netincome.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">net income</a> of over $23 billion.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6">﻿</span>﻿﻿ Amazon, meanwhile, showed revenue of an astounding $321 billion, producing net income of $13 billion.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7">﻿</span>﻿﻿ Over the past five years, these two companies’ stock prices increased by roughly 215% and 560%, respectively.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9">﻿</span>﻿<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8">﻿</span>﻿﻿

Netflix and Google have also shown strong TTM performance, with Netflix posting revenues of over $22 billion and net income of over $2.6 billion.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10">﻿</span>﻿﻿ Google, for its part, generated $166 billion in revenues along with nearly $31 billion in net income.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11">﻿</span>﻿﻿ Buoyed by these earnings, Netflix’s stock rose by 355% in the past five years, while Google's rose by about 158% over the same timeframe.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13">﻿</span>﻿<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12">﻿</span>﻿﻿

The term FANG Stocks was coined by CNBC's "Mad Money" host Jim Cramer in 2013. This acronym refers to the stocks of four prominent American technology companies—Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX), and Alphabet (GOOG). By adding Apple (AAPL) in 2017, "FANG" became "FAANG."

FANG stocks are famous for the impressive growth they have shown in recent years, with each member more than doubling over the past five years. However, despite exhibiting growth stock behavior, FANG stocks are not too volatile. It's this stability, along with delivering superior rates of return, that has made these quite attractive to investors.

Although they each share the use of advanced technologies to acquire and retain users, FANGs have distinct business models. Facebook is the world’s preeminent social networking platform. Amazon is a leading business to consumer (B2C) e-commerce platform. Netflix is an online entertainment streaming service that has also begun aggressively producing its own exclusive content. Alphabet (Google) has leveraged its core expertise as the world’s foremost search engine to develop a highly profitable online advertising business.
