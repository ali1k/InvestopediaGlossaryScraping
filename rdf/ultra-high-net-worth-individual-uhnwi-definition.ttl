Ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNWI) are people with investable assets of at least $30 million. They comprise the wealthiest people in the world and control a tremendous amount of global wealth.

This group of people is small but continues to grow. They totaled 513,244 individuals globally at the end of 2019, up 6.4% from 2018, according to Knight Frank's The Wealth Report, published in 2020. The U.S. has the most UHNWIs in the world by a large margin.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿﻿

The U.S. is home to almost half of the world's UHNWIs—240,575. That's about four times more than China, the country with the second-highest number (61,587 ), and more than all of Asia and Europe combined.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿

Over the next five years, the ranks of the ultra-wealthy will grow by 27%, according to Knight Frank. Asia will see the most growth (44%), followed by Africa (32%). The U.S. will continue to have the most UHNWIs by 2024, adding 22% super-rich individuals.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1">﻿</span>﻿

Eighty-five percent of ultra-high-net-worth wealth is held by people 50 and older, and a majority are men, according to a report published by the Milken Institute published in 2020. Only one in seven are women, but that number is on the rise. Among those below the age of 50, women account for almost one in five.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2">﻿</span>﻿

Many of the world's super-rich citizens are self-made individuals. This is evident in <em>Forbes</em>' annually curated list of the world's richest people. On its World's Real-Time Billionaires List for 2021, the magazine ranks the daily worth on its wealth-tracking platform. According to the website, "The value of individuals’ public holdings are updated every 5 minutes when respective stock markets are open (there will be a 15-minute delay for stock prices)."<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7">﻿</span>﻿

On <em>Forbes</em>' ever-changing list, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/082515/elon-musk-success-story-net-worth-education-top-quotes.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elon Musk</a> and Amazon.com CEO <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/investing/how-jeff-bezos-got-be-worlds-richest-man/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeff Bezos</a> keep swapping number one and number two spots, as of Jan. 13, 2021. Others in the top 10 are Bill Gates, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bernard-arnault.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bernard Arnault</a>, <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="4" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mark-zuckerberg.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark Zuckerberg</a>.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6">﻿</span>﻿ Musk, Bezos, and Gates all founded their own companies, and continue to take an active role in managing their immense wealth.

Others near the top of the world's UHNWI population include several children and in-laws of Sam Walton, the late founder of Wal-Mart.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4">﻿</span>﻿

Most UHNWIs do not have their money sitting in <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/certificateofdeposit.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">certificates of deposit (CDs)</a>, money market accounts, or mutual funds in a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/401kplan.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">401(k)</a>. Here is how their portfolio asset allocations looked toward the end of 2019, according to Knight Frank:<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿

When Forbes published the 2020 billionaires list, which was finalized in March, it pointed out that even the world's wealthiest weren't immune to the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/special-economic-impact-of-pandemics-4800597" rel="noopener noreferrer">economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic</a>. At the time, the combined net worth of the world’s billionaires was $8 trillion, down $700 billion from 2019.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4">﻿</span>﻿

But 25 of the wealthiest people on the list increased their net worth by $255 billion, combined, just two months after the U.S. stock market hit a low on March 23. Facebook's Zuckerberg saw some of the biggest gains, followed by Bezos, due to an increase in the stock prices of their companies. Elon Musk, however, saw the biggest gains in 2020, according to Forbes.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5">﻿</span>﻿
