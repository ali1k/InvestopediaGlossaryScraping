Taxable income is the portion of an individual's or company's income used to calculate how much tax they owe the government in a given tax year. It can broadly be described as <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/agi.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">adjusted gross income</a> (AGI) minus allowable itemized or standard deductions. <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/070915/what-difference-between-taxable-income-and-gross-income.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Taxable income includes</a> wages, salaries, bonuses, and tips, as well as investment income and various types of unearned income.

Unearned income considered to be taxable income includes canceled debts, alimony payments, child support, government benefits (such as unemployment benefits and disability payments), strike benefits, and lottery payments. Taxable income also includes earnings generated from <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/appreciation.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">appreciated</a> assets that have been sold during the year and from dividends and interest income.

When it comes to deductions, the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irs.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Internal Revenue Service</a> (IRS) offers individual tax filers the option to claim the <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standarddeduction.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">standard deduction</a> or a list of <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/itemizeddeduction.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">itemized deductions</a>. Itemized deductions include <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="4" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortgageinterest.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">interest paid on mortgages</a>, medical expenses exceeding a specific threshold (7.5% of AGI for 2020), and a range of other expenses.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13">﻿</span>﻿﻿<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14">﻿</span>﻿

When businesses file their taxes, they do not report their revenue directly as taxable income. Rather, they subtract their <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/businessexpenses.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">business expenses</a> from their revenue to calculate their <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/businessincome.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">business income</a>. Then, they subtract deductions to calculate their taxable income.

To calculate your taxable income for an <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/individual-tax-return.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">individual tax return</a>, you first need to determine your <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/filingstatus.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">filing status</a>. If you are unmarried, you can file your taxes either as a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="3" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/single.asp#:~:text=Single%20filer%20status%20is%20for,months%20of%20the%20tax%20year." rel="noopener noreferrer">single filer</a> or, if you have a qualifying person for whom you pay more than one-half of the support and housing costs, as a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="4" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/head_of_household.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">head of household</a>. If you are married, you will most likely want to file as <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="5" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mfj.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">married filing jointly</a> (MFJ). However, there are <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="6" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/tax/08/file-seperately.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">some limited instances</a> where it may make sense to file as <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="7" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mfs.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">married filing separately</a> (MFS).

Once you know your filing status, you will need to gather documents for all sources of income for yourself, your spouse (if applicable), and any dependents (if applicable). The total of all these sources of income is known as your "gross income." Below are the most common tax forms you will need to calculate your gross income.

The next step is to calculate your adjusted gross income (AGI). Your AGI is the result of taking certain "above-the-line" adjustments to your gross income, such as contributions to a qualifying <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ira.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">individual retirement account</a> (IRA), student loan interest, and certain educator expenses.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="19">﻿</span>﻿ These items are referred to as "above-the-line" because they reduce your income before taking any allowable itemized deductions or the standard deductions.

The next step is to calculate your deductions. As mentioned above, you can either take the standard deduction or you can itemize your deductions.

The standard deduction is a set amount tax filers can claim if they don’t have enough itemized deductions to claim. For 2021, individual tax filers can claim a $12,400 standard deduction ($24,800 for married filing jointly and $18,650 for heads of household).<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8">﻿</span>﻿ These figures rise to $12,550, $25,100, and $18,800 for 2021.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9">﻿</span>﻿

If you plan to itemize deductions rather than take the standard deduction, these are the records most commonly needed.

Owners of sole proprietorships, partnerships, S corporations, and some trusts and estates may be eligible for a qualified business income (QBI) deduction which allows eligible taxpayers to deduct up to 20% of QBI, real estate investment trust (REIT) dividends, and qualified publicly traded partnership (PTP) income.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="21">﻿</span>﻿ If you are an independent contractor, your work will most likely qualify for this special deduction.

For the final step in calculating your taxable income, you will need to take your AGI, calculated above, and subtract all applicable deductions.

The IRS considers almost every type of income to be taxable, but a small number of income streams are nontaxable. For example, if you are a member of a religious organization who has taken a vow of poverty, work for an organization run by that order, and turn your earnings over to the order, your income is nontaxable. Similarly, if you receive an employee achievement award, its value is not taxable as long as certain conditions are met. If someone dies and you receive a life insurance payment, that is nontaxable income as well.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10">﻿</span>﻿

Different tax agencies define taxable and nontaxable income differently. For example, while in the United States the IRS considers lottery winnings to be taxable income, the Canada Revenue Agency considers most lottery winnings and other unexpected one-time windfalls to be nontaxable.<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2">﻿</span>﻿﻿<span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3">﻿</span>﻿

Taxable income includes wages, salaries, bonuses, and tips, as well as investment income and various types of unearned income. Unearned income considered to be taxable income includes canceled debts, alimony payments, child support, government benefits (such as unemployment benefits and disability payments), strike benefits, and lottery payments. Taxable income also includes earnings generated from appreciated assets that have been sold during the year and from dividends and interest income.

The process starts with determining your filing status (single, married, etc.) and gathering documents for all sources of income (W2, 1099, etc.). The next step is calculating your adjusted gross income (AGI), which is "above-the-line" adjustments to your gross income, such as contributions to a qualifying individual retirement account (IRA). Then comes the crucial step of calculating your deductions, which can either be standard and/or itemized deductions. Your taxable income is what's left after subtracting all applicable deductions from AGI.

The IRS recognizes some income streams as nontaxable. For example, if you are a member of a religious organization who has taken a vow of poverty, work for an organization run by that order, and turn your earnings over to the order, your income is nontaxable. Similarly, if you receive an employee achievement award, its value is not taxable as long as certain conditions are met. If someone dies and you receive a life insurance payment, that is nontaxable income as well.
