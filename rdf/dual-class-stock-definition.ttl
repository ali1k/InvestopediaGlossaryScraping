A dual class stock is the issuing of various types of shares by a single company. A dual class stock structure can consist of Class A and Class B shares, for example. Shares can differ, based on distinct <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/votingright.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">voting rights</a> and <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">dividend</a> payments.

When multiple share classes are typically issued: one share class is offered to the general public, while the other is offered to company founders, executives, and family. The class offered to the general public has limited or no voting rights, while the class available to founders and executives has more voting power and often provides for majority control of the company.

Well-known companies, such as Ford and Warren Buffett's <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/berkshire-hathaway.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">Berkshire Hathaway</a>, have dual class stock structures, which provide founders, executives, and family the ability to control majority voting power with a relatively small percentage of total <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equity.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">equity</a>. The dual class structure at Ford, for example, gives the Ford family control of 40% of the voting power, while owning only about 4% of the company's total equity. An extreme is Echostar Communications CEO Charlie Ergen's holding 5% of the company's stock, yet controlling 90% of the vote with his powerful Class A shares.

While they've become popular in recent times, dual-class structures have been around for some time in various forms. The <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nyse.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Stock Exchange</a> (NYSE) banned dual-class structures in 1926 after an outcry over automotive company Dodge Brothers' public offering, which consisted of non-voting shares for the public. But the exchange reinstated the practice during the 1980s in the wake of competition from other exchanges. Once shares are listed, companies cannot reverse any voting rights attributed to the new class, or issue any classes of shares with superior voting rights.

In recent times, the number of companies opting for a dual-class structure during listing has multiplied. In particular, technology startups listing on public markets use this strategy to retain control over their outfits. Alphabet Inc.'s predecessor Google is the most famous example of this trend. Many were frustrated at Google’s <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="1" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ipo.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer">IPO</a> when the now-internet giant, boasting a <a data-component="link" data-ordinal="2" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" href="https://www.investopedia.com/investing/market-capitalization-defined/" rel="noopener noreferrer">market capitalization</a> among the top thirty worldwide, issued second Class B shares to founders with 10 times the amount of votes as ordinary Class A shares, sold to the public.

Several stock indexes have stopped including companies with dual-class structures into their indices. The S&amp;P 500 and FTSE Russell are examples of this trend. Stock exchanges in Asia have moved to take advantage and have relaxed their rules regarding listings of companies. The Hong Kong Stock Exchange, which has now begun allowing dual-class structured stocks, and Singapore's stock exchange are examples of Asian exchanges competing with their Western counterparts for companies with such stock structures.

Dual class stock structures are controversial. Their supporters argue that the structure enables founders to demonstrate strong leadership and the placing of long-term interests over near-term financial results. It also helps founders retain control over the company as potential takeovers can be avoided through their supermajority voting shares. On the other hand, opponents argue that the structure allows a small group of privileged shareholders to maintain control, while other shareholders (with less voting power) provide the majority of the capital. In effect, there is an unequal distribution of risk. The founder is able to access capital from public markets at minimal economic risk. Shareholders carry a major part of the risk related to strategy. Academic research has proved that powerful classes of shares for insiders can actually hinder long term outperformance.

A middle path has been suggested by another group of shareholders. According to them, the effects of a dual-class structure can be limited by placing a time-bound restriction on such structures and allowing shareholders to accumulate voting interest over time.

As mentioned earlier, Alphabet subsidiary Google is the most famous example of a company with a dual-class structure. When it listed in 2004, the search giant unveiled three classes of shares in its offering. Class A shares were reserved for regular investors and had one vote per share. Class B shares were reserved for founders and executives and had 10 times as many votes as those for other classes. Finally, Class C shares were for employees and class A shares and had no voting rights. Other examples of companies with dual-class structures are Facebook, Zynga, Groupon, and Alibaba.
